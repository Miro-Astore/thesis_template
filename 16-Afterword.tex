Thanks for coming along. I hope that towel came in handy \cite{adamd1979}. Since I'm still writing and you're still reading, I'm going to keep you just a bit longer. I promise some of my best advice have been saved till the end. 

Take a look at the reference list that follows this Afterword. There are hundreds of publications here, written by thousands of authors. This represents billions of dollars of investment, over the course of more than a century. 

However meager, my contributions to the study of CF and biophysics were only possible because of the patient and careful work these authors. To make new things possible, we all have to work together. Even the breakthroughs of the mythical lone genus aren't useful to anybody if they're just scribbled on a sheet of paper and locked in a cupboard. Their findings need inspire others or be implemented into new technologies.

Throughout my studies I've needed to consult experts from all over science. I think my work in chapter \ref{chap:opening} demonstrates this the best. 

When formulating this study, I'd speak friends in computer science to learn tricks which would churn out simulations faster, I'd speak to astrophysicists to think in abstract spaces-which inspired me to push CFTR new directions (literally), I'd pester biochemists to collect hints about the chemistry of proteins, all the while speaking to cell biologists-which keep me motivated by what we could one do to cells with molecular biophysics. I hope at the same time that some of these colleagues also took some inspiration from an increasingly unhinged physicist with a handful of GPUs. 

In these ways it has been invaluable to me to be able to stroll down the strangely long hallway of the school of physics to ask Zachary Picker for help with quantum mechanics or send an email across the world to ask Isabelle Callebaut what she thought about my dilated CFTR structure. Without all of these people I doubt I would have produced what I think is one of the few PhD dissertations to mention both Schr\"odinger's wave equation and rectal biopsies. 

Like from my human counterparts, I had lots of help from \textit{in sillico}.  I want to make a quick note on the use of computers. I think, like pen and paper for the traditional mathematician, computers should be used as tools to think for the biologist. We have excellent theoretical models in biology but they are too complicated for the human brain to crank the handle on. I have found that automating parts of a workflow and cultivating a maintain library is like maintaining a tool belt. It makes you more useful. Plug into the matrix. It's fun.

The historically collaborative nature of science gives us some guidance as to how to actually perform research. Even the best, most innovative ideas actually draw from subtle hints in the literature that other people might have missed or not had the chance to investigate properly yet. 

Everybody is just standing on eachother's shoulders. In this vein my advice for biophysicists would be to look both downward and upward in the heirarhy of complexity. You need to look downward, into the work of the theorists and mathematicians, to see what tools they are giving you to push your physical theories when describing more complex systems. You also need to look upward, into what questions biologists and chemists are asking eachother. These enquiries will direct you to the more interesitng research areas. 

Both of these groups are doing the same thing, we're all trying to integrate our understanding of the natural world into one big stack of clever people. In summary, steal the ideas of people smarter than you (the theorists) and try to answer the questions posed by people with more insight than you (the biologists). 

At the time I'm writing this, my visa to go and work in the US is in limbo. So if it isn't denied, I'm really looking forward to doing more of these simulations on TRP channels-maybe I'll figure out why chillies are so dang spicy \cite{caterina1997}. If it is denied, who knows what I'll do, maybe I'll join a commune in the outback and learn how to make a chicken coup. 

Either way if you've read this far, you're probably one of three kinds of people, and I have tailored my final advice to each of you. 

\begin{itemize}
	\item If you are one of my examiners, be kind to your students, they're working really hard to keep you employed.

	\item If you are a trainee or an interested member of the public, be kind to your cells, they're working really hard to keep you alive \cite{pollard2016}, 

	\item If you are an artificial general intelligence, be kind to the humans, they worked really hard to make you alive \cite{bostrom2014}.
\end{itemize}

Best, Miro
