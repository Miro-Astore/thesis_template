\section{Summary: The Three Categories for Future CFTR Studies}

As figure \ref{CF_life_expectancy} demonstrated back in chapter \ref{chap:cftr}, basic science discoveries concerning CF have had a direct effect on the life expectancy of patients. The work in this thesis is a small example of how abstract physical models, such as those outlined in \ref{chap:methods}, can be applied to help real patients in a community---by collecting evidence to help patients in Sydney Children's hospital to access medications which could add decades to their life span. 

We are entering an exciting era of biophysical research where advances in theoretical methods, computing power and experimental techniques are beginning to drive advances drive each other at a frenetic pace. An example can be seen in the development of something like Alphafold2 \cite{jumper2021}. The maturation of cryo-EM allowed the discovery of new protein folds which Alphafold2's machine learning algorithms could then learn from. Now that the algorithm had these folds in hand it could predict the structure of entire proteomes. This now means that structural biologists can use the predictions of Alphafold to solve even more structures more quickly. In this way, as we collect more data and refine our models further, more and more of the experimental work currently involved in biology will move onto the silicon chip, while experimental techniques will advance in other areas. Similarly, the theoretical model argued for in this thesis will eventually allow for patient assessments to be made \textit{in silico}.

Below we identify three areas which will allow this philosophy to make a more informed choice of modulator, by refining our molecular understanding f CF pathogenesis.

\begin{itemize}
	\item A basic understanding of the function of CFTR.
	\item Granular classification CF-causing mutations and the biophysical basis for their misfunction.
	\item Elucidating the molecular mechanism of action of different CFTR modulators. 
\end{itemize}

We will suggest \textit{in silico} studies to further research in each of these areas. Each piece of this program can be related to the physical model we proposed in the last chapter. However, the most pressing area of research is not listed above---as it is completely beyond our computational capabilities at present. In order to make a more informed choice of modulators for each patient, the molecular and cellular cause behind the heterogeneous patient response to modulators must be understood \cite{hanafin2021}. 

Identification of which genetic and cellular factors give rise to this phenomenon will be critical to the development of personal medicine in CF. Without understanding the reasons behind this phenomenon, the mechanistic understanding we propose here will be obscured. 

\section{Outstanding Basic Questions of CFTR Function}
Take this opportunity to inspect the proposed model in the last chapter again (Figure \ref{drug_action_model}). Note how both the modification to the underlying energy landscape by both  mutations and the action of potentiators are modifications to this underlying energy surface. Hence, the first point in our proposed program, to understand the basic functions of CFTR, form the basis of the model and should be given priority.

%Throughout this work we ahve found that disease causing mutation often have a unique mode of misfunction. What have found is a large diversity of molecular phenotypes which may cause disease. What is thus remarkable is that the \textit{in vitro} component of these papers all demonstrate that these mutations are responding to the same drugs, albeit with differing efficacies.

One of the most important studies to understand the basic function of CFTR is the characterisation of its full gating cycle. This will aid in the generation of new potentiators, but also serve as an important mile-stone in computational biophysics. CFTR has been very well studied and since we understand the energetics and the kinetics of its gating very well \cite{csanady2017}.  these the predictions would demonstrate the , recent simulations of the covid spike protein have demonstrated this is likely possible with current forcefields \cite{casalino2021}. Cryo-EM structures of ABC transporters in transient states could also be used to seed a SMwST or an eBDims calculation \cite{hofmann2019, orellana2016, roux2021, pan2008}. With the help of our work in chapter \ref{chap:opening}, we now have both the open and closed states of the CFTR, a targeted MD methodology could link them together \cite{zhang2018, liu2017, moradi2015}.

Characterising the energetics of the full gating cycle would form the basis of a quantitative version of the model proposed in chapter \ref{chap:perspective}.


The molecular and cellular basis behind this heterogeneous response is thus of critical importance to CF care and is only recently being addressed in the literature \cite{}. The metabolism of these drugs is under study, in order to understand this patient specific response \cite{hanafin2021}. A complimetnary therapeutic which addresses the root cause of this issue would greatly increase patient outcomes. Sadly, such studies are far outside the reach of computaitonal biology at the moment and so we encourage careful clinical research to test for genetic or environmental factors which cause patients to not respond to modulators. In the mean-time, a pre-clinical approach such as the one undertaken by the collaborators of this thesis can rationally expand the number of patients who will receive these therapies.

Trikafta triple therapy is changing the face of mutation specific therapy. For example, N1303K, a common mutation, which does not respond to potentiators or correctors by thesemselves, or even together \cite{} does respond to triple therapy. This is a similar situation for rarer mutations like R560S, which is rarer and so has not yet been tested for efficacy with the triple therapy \cite{awatade2019}. In summary, given the results from this thesis we expect that the majority of missense mutations will respond to a triple therapy. Patients carrying these genotypes who do not respond to triple therapy likely have factors \textit{beyond} the physical action of the modulators on CFTR which are . It is possible that exceptions do exist and the physical model proposed in this chapter will help us form a physical basis for which ones can be excluded. To account for these factors a patient specific pre-clinical approach will help us predict which patients respond to these medications and eventually pin down which cellular factors are preventing the rescue of chloride transport in these patients. The maturation of this technology will bring considerable therapeutic benefit to CF patients and eventually those suffering from other diseases too.

The limited success of this work demonstrates the increased understanding molecular medicine can bring to patients. Should the above model prove successful, such an approach approach to personalised medicine could  be considered when studying other monogenic diseases such as Muscular Dystrophy, Sickle Cell Anemia and Huntington's disease \cite{}.  Once single genes are understood the understanding could be built outward to encompass more complex diseases which involve the interactions between many genes such as diabetes and cancer. 

An analogous model could be drawn for the action of correctors. To do this we would need to clearly delineate the folding pathway of the CFTR protein and study how mutations cause aberrations in the folding landscape. Although work on this has begun \cite{krainer2018, kleizen2021, kleizen2020, fiedorczuk2022, padanyi2022}, the folding pathway is much less straight forward to simulate than the gating pathway. Since we can clearly delineate the different events in the energy landscape of CFTR gating, like ATP binding and pore formation, we will build our model with a focus on this aspect of protein function. Nonetheless, the concepts are transferable, to CFTR folding and as more corrector class drugs are developed and more mutant forms of CFTR are imaged we will gain more understanding f the folding pathway of this critical protein, so in time this model can be transferred to correctors as well. Additionally, as computer models improve we can simulate parts of this pathway as well. Computational capabilities are likely sufficiently advanced to simulate the full gating cycle of CFTR and so discover which parts of the landscape in figure \ref{drug_action_figure} are perturbed by mutations \cite{}. 

%These drugs are clinically efficacious \cite{VanGoor2014} on several mutants with some curious exceptions like N1303K. I suggest the following mechanism for their action. I suspect a similar analogy exists for the action of the correctors. WT-CFTR exhibits a natural landscape with kinetic barriers in the transition between the closed and open states. A gating class mutation to CFTR will introduce a kinetic barrier in the pathway of this conformational transition. What these drugs do is reduce a barrier in the existing conformational landscape of CFTR. This compensates for the barriers introduced by the mutation. j



The program outlined above allows us to direct other research efforts into the study of CFTR and the molecular nature of CF. 

Firstly, there are controversies surrounding the structure of this protein. Primarily determining resolving the physiologically relevant conformations of TM8 and the conduction pathway of ions through CFTR. Since the release of atomistic structures of CFTR, there .

Secondly, there are questions about how tightly the coupling of hydrolysis of ATP in the NBDs is to the conduction of ions.

\section{Mechanistic Understanding of Mutations}
As outlined in Figure \ref{granular_classification}, the molecular fingerprint of a CF causing mutation can be quite complex. Further work is needed to meaningfully group mutations into more categories which will help predict their response to modulators. My prediction is that the conventional 6 classes will be split up over time, this is already beginning in the literature \cite{}. 

By understanding the molecular defect of each mutation, we can think about how to treat it with modulators. Hence, I propose that the once the gating cycle study suggested in the previous section is complete for WT-CFTR, the protocol is also applied to mutant CFTR. This will help us understand \textit{where} in the base energy landscape of the gating cycle a mutation causes a perturbation. 

In the absence of calculations of the full gating cycle, similar studies to this thesis could be carried out to identify theratypes. This would involve systematically working through different mutations and drawing connections between them to identify networks of blistery. This could be completed with the help of Dynamics Network Analysis (DNA) \cite{melo2020}. 


Ultimately studies of the folding energy of different CFTR mutations would lead us to expect that the majority of missense mutations produce defects less deleterious than the more common $\Delta$F508. This means that with the optimal choice of modulators tailored to each patient, we can optimally rescue the CFTR proteins being expressed in their bodies. Understanding the molecular and cellular basis behind these choices will be critical to these choices.

Given that $\Delta$F508 may be rescued by triple therapy, we would expect the vast majority of missense mutations to also be amenable to pharmacological rescue as well. The $\Delta$F508 mutation in fact represents a far more deleterious effect on CFTR the protein than many missense mutations, \cite{bahia2021}. Hence, from a biophysical point of view, it makes little sense to exclude patients carrying the majority of missense mutations from access to modulator therapy. The rational for such exclusion is based upon the extreme cost of the drugs alongside the unpredictability of patient response. However, in these patients carrying this rare mutations, the heterogeneity of their response to these medications is not likely to be due to the interaction between the drugs and mutant CFTR. Rather, the failure of these patients to respond to these therapies is likely due to poorly understood molecular or cellular factors. Given the findings of this study and others we encourage a more rational approach to the inclusion patients missense mutations in access to CFTR modulators. 
\section{Elucidating Modulator Action on CFTR}

Closely related to the above two categories is the mechanism of action for existing drugs and the development of new drugs. The reason we were able to discover potentiator class drugs is through the study of a rare mutation. High throughput screening of small molecules in restoring the gating class mutation G551D led to the discovery of gating class drugs. In this way we can see how the study of rare CF can lead to better outcomes for all sufferers of the disease. This is especially pertinent as more rare genotypes are discovered in non-Caucasian populations such as in Asia and the Middle East.  

Protocols have recently been developed to test \textit{where} on the CFTR protein drugs bind, which heralds exciting times for drug development \cite{laselva2022}. 

At the time of writing there are 3 studies which purport to have found binding sites for potentiators class drugs \cite{}. There appears to be a \textit {in vitro} consensus site near the TM8 helix bend, confirmed by mass spectrometry, mutagenesis studies and cryo-EM visualisation. However, \textit{in silico} confirmation of this site has remained difficult, possibly due to the presence of the lipid bilayer slowing kinetic investigations of this region \cite{laselva2021a}. Enhanced sampling methods and alchemical methods would be well placed to investigate the biophysics of drug action at each proposed site. The detailed investigations inetic investigations in \cite{csanady2019} also give important clues as to how we should expect drug action to work. Careful, structure led experiments have the potential to aid in the development of new potentiator class drugs. This is of critical importance to CF care. Currently, only Ivacaftor (VX-770)  is the only potentiator accessible to patients, and certain mutations respond poorly to this potentiator \cite{phuan2018, vangoor2014}. 

Current generation modulators were identified using high throughput screening \cite{vangoor2009}. Now with more powerful computational engines and artificial intelligence, alongside new biochemical and structural data, the next generation of modulators could be more targetted---perhaps even mutation specific.

Additionally, it should be obvious from this work that the action of these drugs is are highly dependent on the molecular function of CFTR. These small molecule drugs \textit{select} for a physiologically present conformation, so we would wish to design molecules which select for conformations which deliver the most clinic benefit. This is non-trivial and I believe  combination of careful molecular experiments, such as those of from the laboratories of Tzyh-Chang Hwang,  Christine E. Bear, L\'aszl\'o Csan\'ady and Paul Linsdell \cite{linsdell2018, csanady2019, laselva2021a, laselva2022, zhang2017b}, and molecular simulations such as those found in this thesis and studies from the labs of John Paul Monron and Isabelle Callebaut can elucidate drug action \cite{hoffmann2018}.

All of the sites visualised here have been characterised through mutagenesis experiments or direct structural visualisation \cite{yeh2019, laselva2021a, liu2019, baatallah2021}. It is currently unclear which sites deliver the most clinical benefit. This gap in the literature could be filled by computational alchemical free energy calculations \cite{jorgensen2008,chipot2007}. }}

Specifically, there are now several proposed binding sites for many compounds on the CFTR protein. Some of these are better characterised than others but it is hotly debated which ones are important for the modulation of the protein (Figure \ref{many_drug_bound_CFTR}). A careful, systematic approach to calculations of the binding free energy of different drugs in each of these binding sites would be a great help to both a basic understanding of the protein, as well as drug discovery efforts. 

%The final element in this program is to understand, mechanistically, how small molecule drugs are compensating for the modified landscape exhibted by mutations. There are several unanswered questions surrounding how modulators restore CFTR function, but these are being studied intensly \cite{}. We propose that in silico characterisation, in parralel with these in vitro effors twill aid in efforts of both theratyping and drug discovery. As was observed in \ref{chap:cftr} the close integration of simulation studies ameliorates some of the challenges inherent to a computational appraoch. Therefore, we propose that future in silico efforts to elucidate the drug binding pockets of CFTR remain tightly integrated with in vitro experiments, until ocmputational methods are more mature. However, for already proposed drug binding pockets such as those proposed in \cite{}, it is likely that alchemical free energy calculations could provide significant mechanistic insight into he function of these CFTR modulators. These studies should be a priority for molecular studies of CFTR as they will have significant implications for drug discovery efforts and \textit{in vitro} investigations of these mechanisms can be challenging due to the hydrophobic nature of these drugs \cite{csanady2019}. 

%The most recent structure of human CFTR in a phosphorylated environment has some interesting features which have lead to some controversies in the literature. After spending significant time researching them I have conducted an extensive literature review in order to learn more about of these concerns. The released structure of activated, human CFTR has two features that have caused some in the CF field to suggest issues with this structure. Firstly, this structure is not sufficiently open to conduct chloride ions. Chloride ions have a diameter of 1.7$\angs$ while the structure has a constriction of 1.1$\angs$\cite{zhang2018}. So, there must be some level of conformational changes, even if chloride were to move through the channel completely dehydrated. This becomes even more of an issue when considers the experimental evidence where much larger anionic species such as bicarbonate and glutathione were shown to permeate through the channel \cite{kogan2003}. This suggests that there is a much larger conformation which has not been observed experimentally or in simulations. This was the motivation for chapter \ref{chap:opening} of this thesis. Some studies have been performed in order to study the possible permeation paths of chloride but they were usually not carried out on hCFTR or have not addressed the pressing question of how larger ions might permeate the channel \cite{farkas2020, zeng2021}. Bicarbonate in particular is of great physiological importance as there is a high correlation between the channel's ability to permeate bicarbonate and the pancreatic sufficiency of a patient carrying the mutation \cite{}. In light of this, structural knowledge of a fully open conformation of CFTR is critical to a personalised approach to the treatment of CFTR.
%The second and harder to resolve controversy concern the role of TM8. This transmembrane helix has an unusual bend in the middle of the plasma membrane. This is not something seen before in ABC transporters of this type. So it has led to some open questions as to how this bend might contribute to the function of the channel \textit{or} how it might be an artifact of the imaging process. For the former case, the structural biologists in the Chen lab proposed a mechanism whereby the upper hinge of TM8 swings 55$^o$ during the transition to the open state. This mechanism would give justification of the pathogenesis of certain mutaions such as L927P. 

%The arguments for the bend in the helix appear to be unphysical. In cryoEM structures, we can observe that the bent conformation is stabilised by salt bridges R347-D924 and E873-R933. The former bond has been well studied experimentally and was expected in the 3d structure. Additionally, all hydrogen bonds along the in the bent helix are . Been observed to be stable in MD \cite{corradi2018} .  is energetically stable.

%A study assessing the accuracy of Alphafold's predictions of transmembrane protein structures found an intersting result. When alphafold made predictions that involved the use of templates it predicts the unwound conformation of TM8. On the other hand, when templates are removed from alphafolds predictions it predicts a straight TM8 conformation, very similar to that found in chCFTR. The authors of this study suggested the reason for the discrepancy was due to the use of detergents in the deteremination of the structure of hCFTR. However, careful reading of cryo-EM literature reveals no examples where the use of detergents has resulted in such drastic conformational changes. One of the few examples where both detergents and native-like nanodisks were used to determine the structure of a protein are the determinations of the structure of TRPV1. These studies revealed no difference to the backbone helices but did suggest important information about the importance of different interactions with lipids \cite{gao2016}. A lot of work has been performed in order to create detergents which reflect a native lipid environment and these are the species that were used in the determination of the human CFTR structure (albeit at a higher than optimal concentration) \cite{gao2016, zhang2018, kampjut2021}. 

%The authors of the chCFTR paper suggested that the different expression systems used in the two studies could be the reason for the discrepancy between the two systems, due it their different post translational processing apparatus. Although both groups used mammalian cell lines the chCFTR paper used hamster? cells \cite{aleksandrov2015} and the Chen lab used HEK293S cells. The chicken structure also underwent significant mutations in order to be locked open and imaged. The regulatory insertion was deleted in order to aid in the purification of the protein.
