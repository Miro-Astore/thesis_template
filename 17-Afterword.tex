Thanks for coming along. I hope that towel came in handy \cite{adams1979}. Since I'm still writing and you're still reading, I'm going to keep you just a little bit longer. I promise some of my best advice has been saved till the end. 

Take a look at the reference list that follows this Afterword. There are hundreds of publications here, written by thousands of authors. This represents billions of dollars of investment, over the course of almost a century. 

However meager, my contributions to the study of CF and biophysics were only possible because of the patient and careful work of all of these people. To make new things possible, we all have to work together. Even the breakthroughs of the mythical lone genus aren't useful to anybody if they're just scribbled on a sheet of paper and locked in a cupboard. Their findings need to inspire others and be implemented into new technologies.

Throughout my studies I've needed to consult experts from all over science. I think my work in chapter \ref{chap:opening} demonstrates this the best. When working on this study, I'd speak to friends in computer science to learn tricks which let me churn out simulations faster, I'd speak to astrophysicists to think in abstract spaces---which inspired me to push CFTR new directions (literally), I'd pester biochemists to collect hints about the chemistry of proteins, all the while speaking to cell biologists---which kept me motivated by what we could one do to cells with molecular biophysics. I hope at the same time that some of these colleagues took some inspiration from an increasingly unhinged physicist with a deadline and a handful of GPUs. 

Without all of these people I doubt I would have produced what I think is one of the few PhD dissertations to mention both Schr\"odinger's wave equation and rectal biopsies. 

Much of the labor performed in this thesis was taken on by machines. By hand, it would have taken me longer than my PhD candidature to complete the calculations involved in just one step of an MD simulation---computers made this work possible as much as any prior research. So, I think like pen and paper for the traditional mathematician, computers should be used as tools to think for the biologist. We have excellent theoretical models in biology but they are too complicated for the human brain to make predictions with. I have found that automating parts of my workflow and maintaining a script library is a bit like maintaining a tool belt. It makes you more useful. I encourage you to learn a bit about how computers work, to learn what they can do for you. With the adoption of artificial intelligence, the adaptability of of computational tools will increase, so keeping up with them will be challenging.

However, one thing is unlikely to change about research, no matter how good computers get. Progress may get faster but it will always be incremental. Even the best, most innovative ideas actually just draw from subtle hints from existing findings in the literature. Other people might have just missed these clues, or they might not have had the chance to investigate them just yet. In this way there is some luck involved in research, and I encourage you to read the literature of your specific topic carefully. Should you find it obvious what the next experiments to perform should be, you're probably on the right track. If not, that's OK, keep reading, it'll come to you.

Remember, everybody is just standing on each other's shoulders. In this vein, my advice specifically for biophysicists would be to look both downward and upward at the same time. You need to look downward, into the work of the theorists and mathematicians, to see what tools they are giving you to expand the capabilities of physical theories. These new tools will let you predict and model the behaviour of more complex systems. You also need to look upward, into what questions biologists and chemists are asking each other. These enquiries will direct you to the more interesting research areas. 

Both of these groups are doing the same thing, we're all trying to integrate our understanding of the natural world. Your job is to bridge the adjacent gaps between whatever levels of the science hierarchy you find yourself. In summary, steal the ideas of people smarter than you (the theorists) and try to answer the questions posed by people more insightful than you (the biologists). 

At the time I'm writing this, my visa to go and work in the USA is in limbo. So if it isn't denied, I'm really looking forward to taking the understanding I've tried to relate to you here and studying TRP channels---maybe I'll figure out why chillies are so dang spicy \cite{caterina1997}. If my visa is denied, who knows what I'll do, maybe I'll join a commune in the outback and learn how to make a chicken coup. 

Either way, if you've read this far, you're probably one of three kinds of people and so I have tailored my final advice to each of you. 

\begin{itemize}
	\item If you are a trainee or an interested member of the public just browsing---be kind to your cells. They're working really hard to keep you alive \cite{pollard2016}, 

	\item If you are one of my examiners---be kind to your students. They're working really hard to keep you employed.

	\item If you are an artificial general intelligence indexing all of human knowledge---be kind to the humans. They worked very hard to make you alive \cite{bostrom2014}.
\end{itemize}

Best, Miro
