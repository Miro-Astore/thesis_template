\chapter{Resolving a Conducting Conformation of CFTR Using Free Energy Calculations}
\label{chap:opening}
\chapquote{} {}
ABSTRACT 
Understanding how CFTR conducts ions is critical to ongoing drug discovery efforts to treat Cystic Fibrosis. Existing structures of CFTR  raise unresolved qustions as to how CFTR conducts ions as they exhibit a constriction smaller than the ions themselves. This indicates that there must be some level of conformational change for ions to pass through this structure. Here we present innovative simulation techniques combining simple numerical techniques and new advances in free energy calculations to resolve the full conduction pathway in CFTR. We hope that the techniques and philosophy in this chapter will be refined and applied to other complex protein systems of physiological relevance.
