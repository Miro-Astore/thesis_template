If this blank in August this is bad.

As figure \ref{CF_life_expectancy} demonstrates, basic science discoveries concerning CF have had a direct effect on the life expectancy of patients. This proves the utility . The work in this thesis is a small example of how abstract physical models, such as those outlined in \ref{chap:methods}, can be applied to help real patients in a community such as allowing patients in Sydney Children's hospital to access medications which could add decades to their life span. We are entering an exciting era of biophysical research where advances in theoretical methods, computing power and experimental techniques are beginning to drive advances in each other at a frenetic pace. An example can be seen in the development of Alphafold. The maturation of cryoEM allowed the discovery of new protein folds which Alphafold's machine learning algorithms could then learn from. Now that the algorithm had these folds in hand it could predict entire proteomes. This now means that structural biologists can use the predictions of alphafold to solve even more structures more quickly. Eventually, more and more of the experimental work currently involved in biology will move onto the silicon chip, while experimental techniques will advance in other areas. Similarly, the theoretical model argued for in this thesis will eventually allow for patient assessments to be made \textit{in silico}
