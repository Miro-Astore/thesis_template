    This document provides a starting point for approaching molecular

    Linear-scaling density functional theory (DFT) is an efficient method to
  describe the electronic structures of molecules, semiconductors, and
  insulators to avoid the high cubic-scaling cost in conventional DFT
  calculations. Here, we present a parallel implementation of linear-scaling
  density matrix trace correcting (TC) purification algorithm to solve the
  Kohn\textendash Sham (KS) equations with the numerical atomic orbitals in the
  HONPAS package. Such a linear-scaling density matrix purification algorithm
  is based on the Kohn's nearsightedness principle, resulting in a sparse
  Hamiltonian matrix with localized basis sets in the DFT calculations.
  Therefore, sparse matrix multiplication is the most time-consuming step in
  the density matrix purification algorithm for linear-scaling DFT
  calculations. We propose to use the MPI\_Allgather function for parallel
  programming to deal with the sparse matrix multiplication within the
  compressed sparse row (CSR) format, which can scale up to hundreds of
  processing cores on modern heterogeneous supercomputers. We demonstrate the
  computational accuracy and efficiency of this parallel density matrix
  purification algorithm by performing large-scale DFT calculations on boron
  nitrogen nanotubes containing tens of thousands of atoms.%

    We present a detailed description and comparison of algorithms for
  performing ab-initio quantum-mechanical calculations using pseudopotentials
  and a plane-wave basis set. We will discuss: (a) partial occupancies within
  the framework of the linear tetrahedron method and the finite temperature
  density-functional theory, (b) iterative methods for the diagonalization of
  the Kohn-Sham Hamiltonian and a discussion of an efficient iterative method
  based on the ideas of Pulay's residual minimization, which is close to an
  order Natoms2 scaling even for relatively large systems, (c) efficient
  Broyden-like and Pulay-like mixing methods for the charge density including a
  new special `preconditioning' optimized for a plane-wave basis set, (d)
  conjugate gradient methods for minimizing the electronic free energy with
  respect to all degrees of freedom simultaneously. We have implemented these
  algorithms within a powerful package called VAMP (Vienna ab-initio
  molecular-dynamics package). The program and the techniques have been used
  successfully for a large number of different systems (liquid and amorphous
  semiconductors, liquid simple and transition metals, metallic and
  semi-conducting surfaces, phonons in simple metals, transition metals and
  semiconductors) and turned out to be very reliable.%

    In contrast to ordinary polymers, the vast majority of biological
  macromolecules adopt highly ordered three-dimensional structures that define
  their functions. The key to folding of a biopolymer into a unique 3D
  structure or to an assembly of several biopolymers into a functional unit is
  a delicate balance between the attractive and repulsive forces that also
  makes such self-assembly reversible under physiological conditions. The
  all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) method has emerged as a powerful tool for
  studies of individual biomolecules and their functional assemblies,
  encompassing systems of ever increasing complexity. However, advances in
  parallel computing technology have outpaced the development of the underlying
  theoretical models - the molecular force fields, pushing the MD method into
  an untested territory. Recent tests of the MD method have found the most
  commonly used molecular force fields to be out of balance, overestimating
  attractive interactions between charged and hydrophobic groups, which can
  promote artificial aggregation in MD simulations of multi-component protein,
  nucleic acid, and lipid systems. One route towards improving the force fields
  is through the NBFIX corrections method, in which the intermolecular forces
  are calibrated against experimentally measured quantities such as osmotic
  pressure by making atom pair-specific adjustments to the non-bonded
  interactions. In this article, we review development of the NBFIX (Non-Bonded
  FIX) corrections to the AMBER and CHARMM force fields and discuss their
  implications for MD simulations of electrolyte solutions, dense DNA systems,
  Holliday junctions, protein folding, and lipid bilayer membranes.%

    Protein force fields have been undergoing continual development since the
  first complete parameter sets were introduced nearly four decades ago. The
  functional forms that underlie these models have many common elements for the
  treatment of bonded and nonbonded forces, which are reviewed here. The most
  widely used force fields to date use a fixed-charge convention in which
  electronic polarization effects are treated via a mean-field approximation
  during partial charge assignment. Despite success in modeling folded proteins
  over many years, the fixed-charge assumption has limitations that cannot
  necessarily be overcome within their potential energy equations. To overcome
  these limitations, several force fields have recently been derived that
  explicitly treat electronic polarization effects with straightforward
  extensions of the potential energy functions used by nonpolarizable force
  fields. Here, we review the history of the most popular nonpolarizable force
  fields (AMBER, CHARMM, OPLS, and GROMOS) as well as studies that have
  validated them and applied them to studies of protein folding and misfolding.
  Building upon these force fields are more recent polarizable interaction
  potentials, including fluctuating charge models, POSSIM, AMOEBA, and the
  classical Drude oscillator. These force fields differ in their
  implementations but all attempt to model electronic polarization in a
  computationally tractable manner. Despite their recent emergence in the field
  of protein folding, several studies have already applied these polarizable
  models to challenging problems in this domain, including the role of
  polarization in folding free energies and sequence-specific effects on the
  stability of {$\alpha$}-helical structures.%

    A simple two-temperature model makes an equal mixture of identical LJ
  particles phase separate and develop crystalline order in cold clusters. , We
  report scalar activity induced phase separation and crystallization in a
  system of 3-d Lennard-Jones particles taken at state points spanning from the
  gas to the liquid regime using molecular dynamics simulation (MD). Scalar
  activity was introduced by increasing the temperature of half of the
  particles (labeled `hot') while keeping the temperature of the other half
  constant at a lower value (labeled `cold'). The relative temperature
  difference between the two subsystems is considered as a measure of the
  activity. From our simulations we observe that the two species tend to phase
  separate at sufficiently high activity ratio. The extent of separation is
  quantified by the defined order parameter and the entropy production during
  this process is determined by employing the two-phase thermodynamic (2PT)
  model and the standard modified Benedict\textendash Webb\textendash Rubin
  (MBWR) equation of state for a LJ fluid. We observe that the extent of the
  phase separation and entropy production increases with the density of the
  system. From a cluster analysis, we obtain the mean number of clusters
  {$\langle$} n cl {$\rangle$}, and the mean size of the largest cluster
  {$\langle$} n 0 {$\rangle$} in the system, complementing each other. Bond
  orientation order parameters reveal that the so formed largest cluster also
  develops solid-like order consisting of both FCC and HCP packing. The
  presence of such crystalline order is also supported by a common neighbor
  analysis.%

    A simple and accurate expression for radial distribution function (RDF) of
  the Lennard-Jones fluid is presented. The expression explicitly states the
  RDF as a continuous function of reduced interparticle distance, temperature,
  and density. It satisfies the limiting conditions of zero density and
  infinite distance imposed by statistical thermodynamics. The distance
  dependence of this expression is expressed by an equation which contains 11
  adjustable parameters. These parameters are fitted to 353 RDF data, obtained
  by molecular dynamics calculations, and then expressed as functions of
  reduced distance, temperature and density. This expression, having a total of
  65 constants, reproduces the RDF data with an average root-mean-squared
  deviation of 0.0152 for the range of state variables of
  0.5{$\leqslant$}T{${_\ast}\leqslant$}5.1 and
  0.35{$\leqslant\rho{_\ast}\leqslant$}1.1 (T{${_\ast}$}=kT/{$\epsilon$} and
  {$\rho{_\ast}$}={$\rho\sigma$}3 are reduced temperature and density,
  respectively). The expression predicts the pressure and the internal energy
  of the Lennard-Jones fluid with an uncertainty that is comparable to that
  obtained directly from the molecular dynamics simulations.%

    Biomolecular simulations are typically performed in an aqueous environment
  where the number of ions remains fixed for the duration of the simulation,
  generally with either a minimally neutralizing ion environment or a number of
  salt pairs intended to match the macroscopic salt concentration. In contrast,
  real biomolecules experience local ion environments where the salt
  concentration is dynamic and may differ from bulk. The degree of salt
  concentration variability and average deviation from the macroscopic
  concentration remains, as yet, unknown. Here, we describe the theory and
  implementation of a Monte Carlo osmostat that can be added to explicit
  solvent molecular dynamics or Monte Carlo simulations to sample from a
  semigrand canonical ensemble in which the number of salt pairs fluctuates
  dynamically during the simulation. The osmostat reproduce the correct
  equilibrium statistics for a simulation volume that can exchange ions with a
  large reservoir at a defined macroscopic salt concentration. To achieve
  useful Monte Carlo acceptance rates, the method makes use of nonequilibrium
  candidate Monte Carlo (NCMC) moves in which monovalent ions and water
  molecules are alchemically transmuted using short nonequilibrium
  trajectories, with a modified Metropolis-Hastings criterion ensuring correct
  equilibrium statistics for an {$\Delta\mu$}, N, p, T) ensemble. We
  demonstrate how typical protein (DHFR and the tyrosine kinase Src) and
  nucleic acid (Drew-Dickerson B-DNA dodecamer) systems exhibit salt
  concentration distributions that significantly differ from fixed-salt bulk
  simulations and display fluctuations that are on the same order of magnitude
  as the average.%

    Computational simulations, akin to wetlab experimentation, are subject to
  statistical fluctuations. Assessing the magnitude of these fluctuations, that
  is, assigning uncertainties to the computed results, is of critical
  importance to drawing statistically reliable conclusions. Here, we use a
  simulation box size as an independent variable, to demonstrate how crucial it
  is to gather sufficient amounts of data before drawing any conclusions about
  the potential thermodynamic and kinetic effects. In various systems, ranging
  from solvation free energies to protein conformational transition rates, we
  showcase how the proposed simulation box size effect disappears with
  increased sampling. This indicates that, if at all, the simulation box size
  only minimally affects both the thermodynamics and kinetics of the type of
  biomolecular systems presented in this work.%

    Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of heptane/vapor, hexadecane/vapor,
  water/vapor, hexadecane/water, and dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC)
  bilayers and monolayers are analyzed to determine the accuracy of treating
  long-range interactions in interfaces with the isotropic periodic sum (IPS)
  method. The method and cutoff (rc) dependences of surface tensions, density
  profiles, water dipole orientation, and electrostatic potential profiles are
  used as metrics. The water/vapor, heptane/vapor, and hexadecane/vapor
  interfaces are accurately and efficiently calculated with 2D IPS (rc = 10 \AA
  ). It is demonstrated that 3D IPS is not practical for any of the interfacial
  systems studied. However, the hybrid method PME/IPS [Particle Mesh Ewald for
  electrostatics and 3D IPS for Lennard-Jones (LJ) interactions] provides an
  efficient way to include both types of long-range forces in simulations of
  large liquid/vacuum and all liquid/liquid interfaces, including lipid
  monolayers and bilayers. A previously published pressure-based long-range LJ
  correction yields results similar to those of PME/IPS for liquid/liquid
  interfaces. The contributions to surface tension of LJ terms arising from
  interactions beyond 10 \AA{} range from 13 dyn/cm for the hexadecane/vapor
  interface to approximately 3 dyn/cm for hexadecane/water and DPPC bilayers
  and monolayers. Surface tensions of alkane/vapor, hexadecane/water, and DPPC
  monolayers based on the CHARMM lipid force fields agree very well with
  experiment, whereas surface tensions of the TIP3P and TIP4P-Ew water models
  underestimate experiment by 16 and 11 dyn/cm, respectively. Dipole potential
  drops ({$\Delta\Psi$}) are less sensitive to long-range LJ interactions than
  surface tensions. However, {$\Delta\Psi$} for the DPPC bilayer (845 {$\pm$} 3
  mV proceeding from water to lipid) and water (547 {$\pm$} 2 mV for TIP4P-Ew
  and 521 {$\pm$} 3 mV for TIP3P) overestimate experiment by factors of 3 and
  5, respectively, and represent expected deficiencies in nonpolarizable force
  fields.%

    3D-IPS/DFFT is an extension of the three-dimensional isotropic periodic sum
  (3D-IPS) for evaluation of electrostatic and Lennard-Jones interactions in
  heterogeneous systems; it utilizes a discrete fast Fourier transform (DFFT)
  for efficient calculation of the IPS potential with a large local region
  radius. The method is demonstrated to be highly accurate for simple bulk
  fluids, liquid/liquid and liquid/vapor interfaces, and lipid bilayers and
  monolayers. Values for rC (the cutoff distance for direct evaluation of
  pairs) and RC (the local region radius) equal to 10 \AA{} and twice the
  longest edge of the periodic cell, respectively, provide excellent efficiency
  and accuracy. Dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC) monolayers simulated with
  the CHARMM (Chemistry at HARvard Molecular Mechanics) C27r lipid parameter
  set and 3D-IPS/DFFT yield surface tensions approximately 8 dyn/cm higher than
  those simulated using particle mesh Ewald (PME), and with experiment. In
  contrast, surface tensions for DMPC bilayers are 16 dyn/cm/leaflet with both
  3D-IPS/DFFT (rC = 10 and 12 \AA ) and PME (rC = 12 \AA ). This indicates that
  PME (rC = 12 \AA ) may be used for simulations of bilayers, but not
  monolayers, and that the large bilayer surface tension arising from C27r is
  incorrect.%

    We report the results from a molecular dynamics (MD) simulation on a 1.0 M
  aqueous NaCl solution using the classical SPC water model and a treatment of
  long-range electrostatic forces involving a 9\textendash 16 \AA{} twin-range
  cut-off. This study was undertaken to explore the importance of truncation
  effects in simulations involving charged species which employ cut-offs at
  longer range than typically used in MD. Artefacts were discerned in the
  ion-ion radial distribution functions at {$\approx$} 16 \AA, indicating that
  increasing the length scale of the truncation scheme does not necessarily
  lead to reliable trajectories. Our results indicate that `charge group-charge
  group' radial distribution functions are a sensitive test for the detection
  of artefacts due to truncation and it is suggested that they should be used
  as a routine screening device in the analysis of MD systems involving charged
  groups.%

    The solvent dielectric response has been evaluated for a system of two

    \field{abstract}{%
    Ewald summation, which has become the de facto standard for computing
  electrostatic interactions in biomolecular simulations, formally requires
  that the simulation box is neutral. For non-neutral systems, the Ewald
  algorithm implicitly introduces a uniform background charge distribution that
  effectively neutralizes the simulation box. Because a uniform distribution of
  counter charges typically deviates from the spatial distribution of
  counterions in real systems, artifacts may arise, in particular in systems
  with an inhomogeneous dielectric constant. Here, we derive an analytical
  expression for the effect of using an implicit background charge instead of
  explicit counterions, on the chemical potential of ions in heterogeneous
  systems, which (i) provides a quantitative criterium for deciding if the
  background charge offers an acceptable trade-off between artifacts arising
  from sampling problems and artifacts arising from the homogeneous background
  charge distribution, and (ii) can be used to correct this artifact in certain
  cases. Our model quantifies the artifact in terms of the difference in charge
  density between the non-neutral system with a uniform neutralizing background
  charge and the real neutral system with a physically correct distribution of
  explicit counterions. We show that for inhomogeneous systems, such as
  proteins and membranes in water, the artifact manifests itself by an
  overstabilization of ions inside the lower dielectric by tens to even
  hundreds kilojoules per mole. We have tested the accuracy of our model in
  molecular dynamics simulations and found that the error in the calculated
  free energy for moving a test charge from water into hexadecane, at different
  net charges of the system and different simulation box sizes, is correctly
  predicted by the model. The calculations further confirm that the incorrect
  distribution of counter charges in the simulation box is solely responsible
  for the errors in the PMFs.%

    The multilevel summation method (MSM) offers an efficient algorithm
  utilizing convolution for evaluating long-range forces arising in molecular
  dynamics simulations. Shifting the balance of computation and communication,
  MSM provides key advantages over the ubiquitous particle-mesh Ewald (PME)
  method, offering better scaling on parallel computers and permitting more
  modeling flexibility, with support for periodic systems as does PME but also
  for semiperiodic and nonperiodic systems. The version of MSM available in the
  simulation program NAMD is described, and its performance and accuracy are
  compared with the PME method. The accuracy feasible for MSM in practical
  applications reproduces PME results for water property calculations of
  density, diffusion constant, dielectric constant, surface tension, radial
  distribution function, and distancedependent Kirkwood factor, even though the
  numerical accuracy of PME is higher than that of MSM. Excellent agreement
  between MSM and PME is found also for interface potentials of air-water and
  membrane-water interfaces, where long-range Coulombic interactions are
  crucial. Applications demonstrate also the suitability of MSM for systems
  with semiperiodic and nonperiodic boundaries. For this purpose, simulations
  have been performed with periodic boundaries along directions parallel to a
  membrane surface but not along the surface normal, yielding membrane pore
  formation induced by an imbalance of charge across the membrane. Using a
  similar semiperiodic boundary condition, ion conduction through a graphene
  nanopore driven by an ion gradient has been simulated. Furthermore, proteins
  have been simulated inside a single spherical water droplet. Finally,
  parallel scalability results show the ability of MSM to outperform PME when
  scaling a system of modest size (less than 100 K atoms) to over a thousand
  processors, demonstrating the suitability of MSM for large-scale parallel
  simulation.%

    Despite the progress in modeling complex molecular systems of
  ever-increasing complexity, a quantitatively accurate computational treatment
  of ion permeation through narrow membrane channels remains challenging. An
  important factor to reach this goal is induced electronic polarization, which
  is likely to impact the permeation rate of small ions through narrow
  molecular pores. In this work, we extended the recently developed polarizable
  force field based on the classical Drude oscillators to assess the role of
  induced polarization effects on the energetics of sodium and potassium ion
  transport across the gramicidin A (gA) ion channel. The inclusion of induced
  polarization lowers barriers present in 1D potential of mean force (PMF) for
  cation permeation by {$\sim$}50\% compared to those obtained with the
  additive force field. Conductance properties calculated with 1D PMFs from
  Drude simulations are in better agreement with experimental results.
  Polarization of single-file water molecules and protein atoms forming the
  narrow pore has a direct impact on the free-energy barriers and
  cation-specific solid-state NMR chemical shifts. Sensitivity analysis
  indicates that small changes to water\textendash channel interactions can
  alter the free energy barrier for ion permeation. These results, illustrating
  polarization effects present in the complex electrostatic environment of the
  gA channel, have broad implications for revising proposed mechanisms of ion
  permeation and selectivity in a variety of ion channels.%

    Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) are implicated in many human
  diseases. They have generally not been amenable to conventional
  structure-based drug design, however, because their intrinsic conformational
  variability has precluded an atomic-level understanding of their binding to
  small molecules. Here we present long-time-scale, atomic-level molecular
  dynamics (MD) simulations of monomeric {$\alpha$}-synuclein (an IDP whose
  aggregation is associated with Parkinson's disease) binding the
  small-molecule drug fasudil in which the observed protein\textendash ligand
  interactions were found to be in good agreement with previously reported NMR
  chemical shift data. In our simulations, fasudil, when bound, favored certain
  charge\textendash charge and {$\pi$}-stacking interactions near the C
  terminus of {$\alpha$}-synuclein but tended not to form these interactions
  simultaneously, rather breaking one of these interactions and forming another
  nearby (a mechanism we term dynamic shuttling). Further simulations with
  small molecules chosen to modify these interactions yielded binding
  affinities and key structural features of binding consistent with subsequent
  NMR experiments, suggesting the potential for MD-based strategies to
  facilitate the rational design of small molecules that bind with disordered
  proteins.%

    A method is developed for representing any communication system
  geometrically. Messages and the corresponding signals are points in two
  "function spaces," and the modulation process is a mapping of one space into
  the other. Using this representation, a number of results in communication
  theory are deduced concerning expansion and compression of bandwidth and the
  threshold effect. Formulas are found for the maxmum rate of transmission of
  binary digits over a system when the signal is perturbed by various types of
  noise. Some of the properties of "ideal" systems which transmit at this
  maxmum rate are discussed. The equivalent number of binary digits per second

    The St\"ormer\textendash Verlet\textendash leapfrog group of integrators
  commonly used in molecular dynamics simulations has long become a textbook
  subject and seems to have been studied exhaustively. There are, however, a
  few striking effects in performance of algorithms which are well known but
  have not received adequate attention in the literature. A closer view of
  these unclear observations results in unexpected conclusions. It is shown
  here that contrary to the conventional point of view, the leapfrog scheme is
  distinguished in this group both in terms of the order of truncation errors
  and the conservation of the total energy. In this case the characteristic
  square growth of fluctuations of the total energy with the step size,
  commonly measured in numerical tests, results from additional interpolation
  errors with no relation to the accuracy of the computed trajectory. An
  alternative procedure is described for checking energy conservation of
  leapfrog-like algorithms which is free from interpolation errors. Preliminary
  tests on a representative model system suggest that standard step size values
  used at present are lower than necessary for accurate sampling.%

    A systematic analysis is performed on the effectiveness of removing degrees
  of freedom from hydrogen atoms and/or increasing hydrogen masses to increase
  the efficiency of molecular dynamics simulations of hydrogen-rich systems
  such as proteins in water. In proteins, high-frequency bond-angle vibrations
  involving hydrogen atoms limit the time step to 3 fs, which is already a
  factor of 1.5 beyond the commonly used time step of 2 fs. Removing these
  degrees of freedom from the system by constructing hydrogen atoms as dummy
  atoms, allows the time step to be increased to 7 fs, a factor of 3.5 compared
  with 2 fs. Additionally, a gain in simulation stability can be achieved by
  increasing the masses of hydrogen atoms with remaining degrees of freedom
  from 1 to 4 u. Increasing hydrogen mass without removing the high-frequency
  degrees of freedom allows the time step to be increased only to 4 fs, a
  factor of two, compared with 2 fs. The net gain in efficiency of sampling
  configurational space may be up to 15\% lower than expected from the increase
  in time step due to the increase in viscosity and decrease in diffusion
  constant. In principle, introducing dummy atoms and increasing hydrogen mass
  do not influence thermodynamical properties of the system and dynamical
  properties are shown to be influenced only to a moderate degree. Comparing
  the maximum time step attainable with these methods (7 fs) to the time step
  of 2 fs that is routinely used in simulation, and taking into account the
  increase in viscosity and decrease in diffusion constant, we can say that a
  net gain in simulation efficiency of a factor of 3 to 3.5 can be achieved.

    In this article, we present a new LINear Constraint Solver (LINCS) for
  molecular simulations with bond constraints. The algorithm is inherently
  stable, as the constraints themselves are reset instead of derivatives of the
  constraints, thereby eliminating drift. Although the derivation of the
  algorithm is presented in terms of matrices, no matrix matrix multiplications
  are needed and only the nonzero matrix elements have to be stored, making the
  method useful for very large molecules. At the same accuracy, the LINCS
  algorithm is three to four times faster than the SHAKE algorithm.
  Parallelization of the algorithm is straightforward. \textcopyright{} 1997

    \field{abstract}{%
    The time step of atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations is
  determined by the fastest motions in the system and is typically limited to 2
  fs. An increasingly popular solution is to increase the mass of the hydrogen
  atoms to \textasciitilde 3 amu and decrease the mass of the parent atom by an
  equivalent amount. This approach, known as hydrogen-mass repartitioning
  (HMR), permits time steps up to 4 fs with reasonable simulation stability.
  While HMR has been applied in many published studies to date, it has not been
  extensively tested for membrane-containing systems. Here, we compare the
  results of simulations of a variety of membranes and membrane-protein systems
  run using a 2-fs time step and a 4-fs time step with HMR. For pure membrane
  systems, we find almost no difference in structural properties, such as
  area-per-lipid, electron density profiles, and order parameters, although
  there are differences in kinetic properties such as the diffusion constant.
  Conductance through a porin in an applied field, partitioning of a small
  peptide, hydrogen-bond dynamics, and membrane mixing show very little
  dependence on HMR and the time step. We also tested a 9-\AA{} cutoff compared
  to the standard CHARMM cutoff of 12 \AA, finding significant deviations in
  many properties tested. We conclude that HMR is a valid approach for membrane
  systems but a 9-\AA{} cutoff is not.,%

    Membrane ion channels are the fundamental electrical components in the
  nervous system. Recent developments in X-ray crystallography and cryo-EM
  microscopy have revealed what these proteins look like in atomic detail but

  progressed to the point that we can now simulate realistic molecular
  assemblies to produce quantitative calculations of the thermodynamic and
  kinetic quantities that control function. In this review, we summarize the
  state of atomistic simulation methods for ion channels to understand their
  conduction, activation, and drug modulation mechanisms. We are at a
  crossroads in atomistic simulation, where long time scale observation can
  provide unbiased exploration of mechanisms, supplemented by biased free

    Cystic fibrosis (CF) lung disease reflects the failure of airways defense
  against chronic bacterial infection. Studies of CF cultures, transgenic mice,
  and CF patients suggest that the initiating event in CF airways disease
  pathogenesis is reduced airway surface liquid (ASL) volume, i.e.,
  dehydration. CF ASL volume regulation depends on a single extracellular
  signaling system, ATP, which renders CF airways more vulnerable to
  disease-causing insults (e.g., viruses) than are normal airways, which
  regulate ASL volume by dual ATP and adenosine signaling pathways. Clinical
  studies have explored the hypothesis that treating the dehydration of CF
  airways will be therapeutically beneficial. Inhaled hypertonic saline
  osmotically draws water onto airway surfaces, improves mucus clearance and
  pulmonary function, and reduces acute exacerbations in CF patients. Thus,
  rehydration therapies may slow the progression of CF lung disease in patients
  with established bacterial infection and may prevent the onset of CF lung
  disease if initiated early in life. Copyright \textcopyright{} 2007 by Annual

    Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common autosomal recessive disorder in
  Caucasian populations. Individuals with CF have seen significant increases in
  life expectancy in the last 60 years. As a result, previously rare
  complications are now coming to light. The most common of these is cystic
  fibrosis-related diabetes (CFRD), which affects 40-50\% of CF adults. CFRD
  significantly impacts the pulmonary function and longevity of CF patients,
  yet a lack of consensus on the best methods to diagnose and treat CFRD
  remains. We begin by reviewing our understanding of the pathogenesis of CFRD,
  as emerging evidence shows the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance
  regulator (CFTR) also has important roles in the release of insulin and
  glucagon and in the protection of {$\beta$} cells from oxidative stress. We
  then discuss how current recommended methods of CFRD diagnosis are not
  appropriate, as continuous glucose monitoring becomes more effective,
  practical, and cost-effective. Finally, we evaluate emerging treatments which
  have narrowed the mortality gap within the CF patient group. In the future,
  pharmacological potentiators and correctors directly targeting CFTR show huge
  promise for both CFRD and the wider CF patient groups.%

    Cystic fibrosis is caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane
  conductance regulator (CFTR). CFTR is a member of the ATP-binding cassette
  (ABC) family of membrane transport proteins, most members of which function
  as ATP-dependent pumps. CFTR is unique among human ABC proteins in
  functioning not as a pump, but as an ion channel. Recent structural data has
  indicated that CFTR shares broadly similar overall architecture and
  ATP-dependent conformational changes as other ABC proteins. Functional
  investigations suggest that CFTR has a unique open portal connecting the
  cytoplasm to the transmembrane channel pore, that allows for a continuous
  pathway for Cl- ions to cross the membrane in one conformation. This lateral
  portal may be what allows CFTR to function as an ion channel rather than as a
  pump, suggesting a plausible mechanism by which channel function may have
  evolved in CFTR.%

    The Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (CFTR) anion
  channel is essential for epithelial salt\textendash water balance. CFTR
  mutations cause cystic fibrosis, a lethal incurable disease. In cells CFTR is
  activated through the cAMP signaling pathway, overstimulation of which during
  cholera leads to CFTR-mediated intestinal salt\textendash water loss. Channel
  activation is achieved by phosphorylation of its regulatory (R) domain by
  cAMP-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (PKA). Here we show using two
  independent approaches\textendash\textendash an ATP analog that can drive
  CFTR channel gating but is unsuitable for phosphotransfer by PKA, and CFTR
  mutants lacking phosphorylatable serines\textendash\textendash that PKA
  efficiently opens CFTR channels through simple binding, under conditions that
  preclude phosphorylation. Unlike when phosphorylation happens, CFTR
  activation by PKA binding is completely reversible. Thus, PKA binding
  promotes release of the unphosphorylated R domain from its inhibitory
  position, causing full channel activation, whereas phosphorylation serves
  only to maintain channel activity beyond termination of the PKA signal. The
  results suggest two levels of CFTR regulation in cells: irreversible through
  phosphorylation, and reversible through R-domain binding to
  PKA\textendash\textendash and possibly also to other members of a large
  network of proteins known to interact with the channel.%

    The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is an anion
  channel important in maintaining proper functions of the lung, pancreas, and
  intestine. The activity of CFTR is regulated by ATP and protein kinase
  A-dependent phosphorylation. To understand the conformational changes
  elicited by phosphorylation and ATP binding, we present here the structure of
  phosphorylated, ATP-bound human CFTR, determined by cryoelectron microscopy
  to 3.2-\AA{} resolution. This structure reveals the position of the R domain
  after phosphorylation. By comparing the structures of human CFTR and
  zebrafish CFTR determined under the same condition, we identified common
  features essential to channel gating. The differences in their structures
  indicate plasticity permitted in evolution to achieve the same function.
  Finally, the structure of CFTR provides a better understanding of why the
  G178R, R352Q, L927P, and G970R/D mutations would impede conformational
  changes of CFTR and lead to cystic fibrosis.%

    The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is an anion
  channel evolved from the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter family. In
  this study, we determined the structure of zebrafish CFTR in the absence of
  ATP by electron cryo-microscopy to 3.7 \AA{} resolution. Human and zebrafish
  CFTR share 55\% sequence identity, and 42 of the 46 cystic-fibrosis-causing
  missense mutational sites are identical. In CFTR, we observe a large anion
  conduction pathway lined by numerous positively charged residues. A single
  gate near the extracellular surface closes the channel. The regulatory
  domain, dephosphorylated, is located in the intracellular opening between the
  two nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs), preventing NBD dimerization and
  channel opening. The structure also reveals why many cystic-fibrosis-causing
  mutations would lead to defects either in folding, ion conduction, or gating
  and suggests new avenues for therapeutic intervention.%

  phosphorylation site required. In addition, nucleotide binding and hydrolysis
  at the nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs) of CFTR are required for channel
  gating. We report NMR studies in the absence and presence of NBD1 that
  provide structural details for the isolated R region and its interaction with
  NBD1 at residue-level resolution. Several sites in the R region with measured
  fractional helical propensity mediate interactions with NBD1. Phosphorylation
  reduces the helicity of many R-region sites and reduces their NBD1
  interactions. This evidence for a dynamic complex with NBD1 that transiently
  engages different sites of the R region suggests a structural explanation for
  the dependence of CFTR activity on multiple PKA phosphorylation sites.

    \field{abstract}{%
    The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is an anion
  channel evolved from an ATP-binding cassette transporter. CFTR channel gating
  is strictly coupled to phosphorylation and ATP hydrolysis. Previously, we
  reported essentially identical structures of zebrafish and human CFTR in the
  dephosphorylated, ATP-free form. Here, we present the structure of zebrafish
  CFTR in the phosphorylated, ATP-bound conformation, determined by
  cryoelectron microscopy to 3.4 \AA{} resolution. Comparison of the two
  conformations shows major structural rearrangements leading to channel
  opening. The phosphorylated regulatory domain is disengaged from its
  inhibitory position; the nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs) form a
  ``head-to-tail'' dimer upon binding ATP; and the cytoplasmic pathway, found
  closed off in other ATP-binding cassette transporters, is cracked open,
  consistent with CFTR's unique channel function. Unexpectedly, the
  extracellular mouth of the ion pore remains closed, indicating that local
  movements of the transmembrane helices can control ion access to the pore
  even in the NBD-dimerized conformation.%

    Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has recently provided invaluable
  experimental data about the full-length cystic fibrosis transmembrane
  conductance regulator (CFTR) 3D structure. However, this experimental
  information deals with inactive states of the channel, either in an apo,
  quiescent conformation, in which nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs) are widely
  separated or in an ATP-bound, yet closed conformation. Here, we show that 3D
  structure models of the open and closed forms of the channel, now further
  supported by metadynamics simulations and by comparison with the cryo-EM
  data, could be used to gain some insights into critical features of the
  conformational transition toward active CFTR forms. These critical elements
  lie within membrane-spanning domains but also within NBD1 and the N-terminal
  extension, in which conformational plasticity is predicted to occur to help
  the interaction with filamin, one of the CFTR cellular partners.%

    CFTR (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator), a member of the
  ABC (ATP-binding cassette) superfamily of membrane proteins, possesses two
  NBDs (nucleotide-binding domains) in addition to two MSDs (membrane spanning
  domains) and the regulatory 'R' domain. The two NBDs of CFTR have been
  modelled as a heterodimer, stabilized by ATP binding at two sites in the NBD
  interface. It has been suggested that ATP hydrolysis occurs at only one of
  these sites as the putative catalytic base is only conserved in NBD2 of CFTR
  (Glu 1371), but not in NBD1 where the corresponding residue is a serine,
  Ser573. Previously, we showed that fragments of CFTR corresponding to NBD1
  and NBD2 can be purified and co-reconstituted to form a heterodimer capable
  of ATPase activity. In the present study, we show that the two NBD fragments
  form a complex in vivo, supporting the utility of this model system to
  evaluate the role of Glu1371 in ATP binding and hydrolysis. The present
  studies revealed that a mutant NBD2 (E1371Q) retains wild-type nucleotide
  binding affinity of NBD2. On the other hand, this substitution abolished the
  ATPase activity formed by the co-purified complex. Interestingly,
  introduction of a glutamate residue in place of the non-conserved Ser 573 in
  NBD1 did not confer additional ATPase activity by the heterodimer,
  implicating a vital role for multiple residues in formation of the catalytic
  site. These findings provide the first biochemical evidence suggesting that
  the Walker B residue: Glu1371, plays a primary role in the ATPase activity
  conferred by the NBD1-NBD2 heterodimer. \textcopyright{} 2007 Biochemical

    Small molecule chaperones have been exploited as therapeutics for the
  hundreds of diseases caused by protein misfolding. The most successful
  examples are the CFTR correctors, which transformed cystic fibrosis therapy.
  These molecules revert folding defects of the DF508 mutant and are widely
  used to treat patients. To investigate the molecular mechanism of their
  action, we determined cryo-electron microscopy structures of CFTR in complex
  with the FDA-approved correctors lumacaftor or tezacaftor. Both drugs insert
  into a hydrophobic pocket in the first transmembrane domain (TMD1), linking
  together four helices that are thermodynamically unstable. Mutating residues
  at the binding site rendered DF508-CFTR insensitive to lumacaftor and
  tezacaftor, underscoring the functional significance of the structural
  discovery. These results support a mechanism in which the correctors
  stabilize TMD1 at an early stage of biogenesis, prevent its premature
  degradation, and thereby allosterically rescuing many disease-causing
  mutations.%

    Background: Ivacaftor (KALYDECO\texttrademark, VX-770) is a CFTR
  potentiator that increased CFTR channel activity and improved lung function
  in patients age 6. years and older with CF who have the G551D-CFTR gating
  mutation. The aim of this in vitro study was to evaluate the effect of
  ivacaftor on mutant CFTR protein forms with defects in protein processing
  and/or channel function. Methods: The effect of ivacaftor on CFTR function
  was tested in electrophysiological studies using a panel of Fischer rat
  thyroid (FRT) cells expressing 54 missense CFTR mutations that cause defects
  in the amount or function of CFTR at the cell surface. Results: Ivacaftor
  potentiated multiple mutant CFTR protein forms that produce functional CFTR
  at the cell surface. These included mutant CFTR forms with mild defects in
  CFTR processing or mild defects in CFTR channel conductance. Conclusions:
  These in vitro data indicated that ivacaftor is a broad acting CFTR
  potentiator and could be used to help stratify patients with CF who have
  different CFTR genotypes for studies investigating the potential clinical
  benefit of ivacaftor. \textcopyright{} 2013 European Cystic Fibrosis

    Significant progress has been made in the development of CFTR modulator
  therapy; however, current CFTR modulator therapies are only available for a
  minority of the CF-patient population. Additionally, heterogeneity in in vivo
  modulator response has been reported among individuals carrying homozygous
  F508del-CFTR, adding to the desire for an optimal prediction of
  response-to-therapy on an individual level. In the last decade, a lot of
  progress has been made in the development of primary cell cultures into 3D
  patient-derived disease models. The advantage of these models is that the
  endogenous CFTR function is affected by the patient's mutation as well as
  other genetic or environmental factors. In this review we focus on intestinal
  organoids as in vitro model for CF, enabling for CF disease classification,
  drug development and treatment optimization in a personalized manner, taking
  into account rare CFTR mutations and clinical heterogeneity among individuals
  with CF.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    We recently established conditions allowing for long-term expansion of
  epithelial organoids from intestine, recapitulating essential features of the
  in vivo tissue architecture. Here we apply this technology to study primary
  intestinal organoids of people suffering from cystic fibrosis, a disease
  caused by mutations in CFTR, encoding cystic fibrosis transmembrane
  conductance regulator. Forskolin induces rapid swelling of organoids derived
  from healthy controls or wild-type mice, but this effect is strongly reduced
  in organoids of subjects with cystic fibrosis or in mice carrying the Cftr
  F508del mutation and is absent in Cftr-deficient organoids. This pattern is
  phenocopied by CFTR-specific inhibitors. Forskolin-induced swelling of in
  vitro-expanded human control and cystic fibrosis organoids corresponds
  quantitatively with forskolin-induced anion currents in freshly excised ex
  vivo rectal biopsies. Function of the CFTR F508del mutant protein is restored
  by incubation at low temperature, as well as by CFTR-restoring compounds.
  This relatively simple and robust assay will facilitate diagnosis, functional
  studies, drug development and personalized medicine approaches in cystic
  fibrosis.%
