    Hofstadter's long-awaited return to the themes of G\"odel, Escher, Bach--an
  original and controversial view of the nature of consciousness and identity.
  What do we mean when we say "I"? Can a self, a soul, a consciousness, an "I"
  arise out of mere matter? If it cannot, then how can you or I be here? This
  book argues that the key to understanding selves and consciousness is a
  special kind of abstract feedback loop inhabiting our brains. Deep down, a
  human brain is a chaotic soup of particles, on a higher level it is a jungle
  of neurons, and on a yet higher level it is a network of abstractions that we
  call "symbols." The most central and complex symbol in your brain or mine is
  the one we both call "I." But how can such a mysterious abstraction be
  real--or is our "I" merely a convenient fiction?--From publisher description%

    The third edition of this classic text presents a complete introduction to
  plasma physics and controlled fusion, written by one of the pioneering
  scientists in this expanding field. It offers both a simple and intuitive
  discussion of the basic concepts of the subject matter and an insight into
  the challenging problems of current research. This outstanding text offers
  students a painless introduction to this important field; for teachers, a
  large collection of problems; and for researchers, a concise review of the
  fundamentals as well as original treatments of a number of topics never
  before explained so clearly. In a wholly lucid manner the second edition
  covered charged-particle motions, plasmas as fluids, kinetic theory, and
  nonlinear effects. For the third edition, two new chapters have been added to
  incorporate discussion of more recent advances in the field. The new chapter
  9 on Special Plasmas covers non-neutral plasmas, pure electron plasmas, solid
  and ultra-cold plasmas, pair-ion plasmas, dusty plasmas, helicon plasmas,
  atmospheric-pressure plasmas, sheath-bounded plasmas, reconnection and
  turbulence. Following this, chapter 10 describes Plasma Applications such as
  magnetic fusion (pinches, mirrors, FRCs, stellarators, tokamaks, spheromaks),
  plasma accelerators and FELs, ine rtial fusion, semiconductor etching, and
  spacecraft propulsion. This new revised edition remains an essential text for
  those new to the field and an invaluable reference source for established
  researchers.%

    Erwin Schr\"odinger famously and presciently ascribed the vehicle
  transmitting the hereditary information underlying life to an `aperiodic
  crystal'. We compare and contrast this, only later discovered to be stored in
  the linear biomolecule DNA, with the information-bearing, layered
  quasi-one-dimensional materials investigated by the emerging field of chaotic
  crystallography . Despite differences in functionality, the same information
  measures capture structure and novelty in both, suggesting an intimate
  coherence between the information character of biotic and abiotic
  matter\textemdash a broadly applicable physics of information. We review
  layered solids and consider three examples of how information- and
  computation-theoretic techniques are being applied to understand their
  structure. In particular, (i) we review recent efforts to apply new kinds of
  information measures to quantify disordered crystals; (ii) we discuss the
  structure of ice I in information-theoretic terms; and (iii) we recount
  recent investigations into the structure of
  tris(bicyclo[2.1.1]hexeno)benzene, showing how an information-theoretic
  analysis yields additional insight into its structure. We then illustrate a
  new Second Law of Thermodynamics that describes information processing in
  active low-dimensional materials, reviewing Maxwell's Demon and a new class
  of molecular devices that act as information catalysts. Lastly, we conclude
  by speculating on how these ideas from informational materials science may
  impact biology.%

    Continuum theories of electrolytes are widely used to describe physical
  processes in various biological systems. Although these are well-established
  theories in macroscopic situations, it is not clear from the outset that they
  should work in small systems whose dimensions are comparable to or smaller
  than the Debye length. Here, we test the validity of the mean-field
  approximation in Poisson-Boltzmann theory by comparing its predictions with
  those of Brownian dynamics simulations. For this purpose we use spherical and
  cylindrical boundaries and a catenary shape similar to that of the
  acetylcholine receptor channel. The interior region filled with electrolyte
  is assumed to have a high dielectric constant, and the exterior region
  representing protein a low one. Comparisons of the force on a test ion
  obtained with the two methods show that the shielding effect due to
  counterions is overestimated in Poisson-Boltzmann theory when the ion is
  within a Debye length of the boundary. As the ion gets closer to the
  boundary, the discrepancy in force grows rapidly. The implication for
  membrane channels, whose radii are typically smaller than the Debye length,
  is that Poisson-Boltzmann theory cannot be used to obtain reliable estimates
  of the electrostatic potential energy and force on an ion in the channel
  environment.%

    We test the validity of the mean-field approximation in Poisson-Nernst-
  Planck theory by contrasting its predictions with those of Brownian dynamics
  simulations in schematic cylindrical channels and in a realistic potassium
  channel. Equivalence of the two theories in bulk situations is demonstrated
  in a control study. In simple cylindrical channels, considerable differences
  are found between the two theories with regard to the concentration profiles
  in the channel and its conductance properties. These differences are at a
  maximum in narrow channels with a radius smaller than the Debye length and
  diminish with increasing radius. Convergence occurs when the channel radius
  is over 2 Debye lengths. These tests unequivocally demonstrate that the mean-
  field approximation in the Poisson-Nernst-Planck theory breaks down in narrow
  ion channels that have radii smaller than the Debye length.%

    Voltage-gated calcium (Ca2+) channels are key transducers of membrane
  potential changes into intracellular Ca2+ transients that initiate many
  physiological events. There are ten members of the voltage-gated Ca2+ channel
  family in mammals, and they serve distinct roles in cellular signal
  transduction. The CaV1 subfamily initiates contraction, secretion, regulation
  of gene expression, integration of synaptic input in neurons, and synaptic
  transmission at ribbon synapses in specialized sensory cells. The CaV2
  subfamily is primarily responsible for initiation of synaptic transmission at
  fast synapses. The CaV3 subfamily is important for repetitive firing of
  action potentials in rhythmically firing cells such as cardiac myocytes and
  thalamic neurons. This article presents the molecular relationships and
  physiological functions of these Ca2+ channel proteins and provides
  information on their molecular, genetic, physiological, and pharmacological
  properties., The activity of a voltage-gated calcium channel is enhanced by
  the binding of an effector ready to respond to a calcium signal. This
  effector checkpoint mechanism may be a unifying theme in voltage-gated
  calcium channel regulation.%

    Cell polarization is an evolutionarily conserved process that facilitates
  asymmetric distribution of organelles and proteins, is an evolutionarily
  conserved property that is modified dynamically during physiological
  processes such as cell division, migration, and morphogenesis. The plasticity
  with which cells change their behavior and phenotype in response to cell
  intrinsic and extrinsic cues is an essential feature of normal physiology. In
  disease states such as cancer, cells lose their ability to behave normally in
  response to physiological cues. A molecular understanding of mechanisms that
  alter the behavior of cancer cells is limited. Cell polarity proteins are an
  recognized class of molecules that can receive and interpret both intrinsic
  and extrinsic signals to modulate cell behavior. In this review, we discuss
  how cell polarity proteins regulate a diverse array of biological processes
  and how they can contribute to alterations in the behavior of cancer cells.%

    Pattern formation, as occurs during embryogenesis or regeneration, is the
  crucial link between genotype and the functions upon which selection
  operates. Even cancer and aging can be seen as challenges to the continuous
  physiological processes that orchestrate individual cell activities toward
  the anatomical needs of an organism. Thus, the origin and maintenance of
  complex biological shape is a fundamental question for cell, developmental,
  and evolutionary biology, as well as for biomedicine. It has long been
  recognized that slow bioelectrical gradients can control cell behaviors and
  morphogenesis. Here, I review recent molecular data that implicate endogenous
  spatio-temporal patterns of resting potentials among non-excitable cells as
  instructive cues in embryogenesis, regeneration, and cancer. Functional data
  have implicated gradients of resting potential in processes such as limb
  regeneration, eye induction, craniofacial patterning, and head-tail polarity,
  as well as in metastatic transformation and tumorigenesis. The genome is
  tightly linked to bioelectric signaling, via ion channel proteins that shape
  the gradients, downstream genes whose transcription is regulated by voltage,
  and transduction machinery that converts changes in bioelectric state to
  second-messenger cascades. However, the data clearly indicate that
  bioelectric signaling is an autonomous layer of control not reducible to a
  biochemical or genetic account of cell state. The real-time dynamics of
  bioelectric communication among cells are not fully captured by
  transcriptomic or proteomic analyses, and the necessary-and-sufficient
  triggers for specific changes in growth and form can be physiological states,
  while the underlying gene loci are free to diverge. The next steps in this
  exciting new field include the development of novel conceptual tools for
  understanding the anatomical semantics encoded in non-neural bioelectrical
  networks, and of improved biophysical tools for reading and writing
  electrical state information into somatic tissues. Cracking the bioelectric
  code will have transformative implications for developmental biology,
  regenerative medicine, and synthetic bioengineering.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    In addition to biochemical gradients and transcriptional networks, cell
  behavior is regulated by endogenous bioelectrical cues originating in the
  activity of ion channels and pumps, operating in a wide variety of cell
  types. Instructive signals mediated by changes in resting potential control
  proliferation, differentiation, cell shape, and apoptosis of stem,
  progenitor, and somatic cells. Of importance, however, cells are regulated
  not only by their own Vmem but also by the Vmem of their neighbors, forming
  networks via electrical synapses known as gap junctions. Spatiotemporal
  changes in Vmem distribution among nonneural somatic tissues regulate pattern
  formation and serve as signals that trigger limb regeneration, induce eye
  formation, set polarity of whole-body anatomical axes, and orchestrate
  craniofacial patterning. New tools for tracking and functionally altering
  Vmem gradients in vivo have identified novel roles for bioelectrical
  signaling and revealed the molecular pathways by which Vmem changes are
  transduced into cascades of downstream gene expression. Because channels and
  gap junctions are gated posttranslationally, bioelectrical networks have
  their own characteristic dynamics that do not reduce to molecular profiling
  of channel expression (although they couple functionally to transcriptional
  networks). The recent data provide an exciting opportunity to crack the
  bioelectric code, and learn to program cellular activity at the level of
  organs, not only cell types. The understanding of how patterning information
  is encoded in bioelectrical networks, which may require concepts from
  computational neuroscience, will have transformative implications for
  embryogenesis, regeneration, cancer, and synthetic bioengineering.%

    The success of mechanism-based drug discovery depends on the definition of
  the drug target. This definition becomes even more important as we try to
  link drug response to genetic variation, understand stratified clinical
  efficacy and safety, rationalize the differences between drugs in the same
  therapeutic class and predict drug utility in patient subgroups. However,
  drug targets are often poorly defined in the literature, both for launched
  drugs and for potential therapeutic agents in discovery and development.
  Here, we present an updated comprehensive map of molecular targets of
  approved drugs. We curate a total of 893 human and pathogen-derived
  biomolecules through which 1,578 US FDA-approved drugs act. These
  biomolecules include 667 human-genome-derived proteins targeted by drugs for
  human disease. Analysis of these drug targets indicates the continued
  dominance of privileged target families across disease areas, but also the
  growth of novel first-in-class mechanisms, particularly in oncology. We
  explore the relationships between bioactivity class and clinical success, as
  well as the presence of orthologues between human and animal models and
  between pathogen and human genomes. Through the collaboration of three
  independent teams, we highlight some of the ongoing challenges in accurately
  defining the targets of molecular therapeutics and present conventions for
  deconvoluting the complexities of molecular pharmacology and drug efficacy.%

    The human ether-a-go-go-related gene (hERG) encodes the pore-forming
  alpha-subunit of a voltage-gated potassium (K(+)) channel. A variety of
  unrelated compounds reduce K(+ )current in the heart by blocking the pore or
  disrupting trafficking of the hERG channel to the membrane surface. This
  induces a syndrome known as long QT, which arises from abnormalities in
  action potential repolarisation and can degenerate into lethal cardiac
  arrhythmias. As a result, this undesirable side effect has severely hindered
  safe drug development. This review describes progress in understanding the
  molecular basis for drug binding to hERG, outlines the characteristics of
  hERG ligands and discusses experimental and in silico approaches for
  identifying compounds with QT liabilities. Recent developments should enable
  recognition of hERG-positive compounds at the early stages of their
  development.%

    Ion channel targeted drugs have always been related with either the central
  nervous system (CNS), the peripheral nervous system, or the cardiovascular
  system. Within the CNS, basic indications of drugs are: sleep disorders,
  anxiety, epilepsy, pain, etc. However, traditional channel blockers have
  multiple adverse events, mainly due to low specificity of mechanism of
  action. Lately, novel ion channel subtypes have been discovered, which gives
  premises to drug discovery process led towards specific channel subtypes. An
  example is Na+ channels, whose subtypes 1.3 and 1.7-1.9 are responsible for
  pain, and 1.1 and 1.2 \textendash{} for epilepsy. Moreover, new drug
  candidates have been recognized. This review is focusing on ion channels
  subtypes, which play a significant role in current drug discovery and
  development process. The knowledge on channel subtypes has developed rapidly,
  giving new nomenclatures of ion channels. For example, Ca2+ channels are not
  any more divided to T, L, N, P/Q, and R, but they are described as
  Cav1.1-Cav3.3, with even newer nomenclature {$\alpha$}1A-{$\alpha$}1I and
  {$\alpha$}1S. Moreover, new channels such as P2X1-P2X7, as well as
  TRPA1-TRPV1 have been discovered, giving premises for new types of analgesic
  drugs.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    Animal venoms are a rich source of bioactive peptides that efficiently
  modulate key receptors and ion channels involved in cellular excitability to
  rapidly neutralize their prey or predators. As such, they have been a
  wellspring of highly useful pharmacological tools for decades. Besides
  targeting ion channels, some venom peptides exhibit strong cytotoxic activity
  and preferentially affect cancer over healthy cells. This is unlikely to be
  driven by an evolutionary impetus, and differences in tumor cells and the
  tumor microenvironment are probably behind the serendipitous selectivity
  shown by some venom peptides. However, strategies such as bioconjugation and
  nanotechnologies are showing potential to improve their selectivity and
  potency, thereby paving the way to efficiently harness new anticancer
  mechanisms offered by venom peptides. This review aims to highlight advances
  in nano- and chemotherapeutic tools and prospective anti-cancer drug leads
  derived from animal venom peptides. A strategy that has been gaining
  increased application for the study of the conformation, dynamics,
  orientation, and physicochemical properties of peptides is labeling with the
  paramagnetic amino acid TOAC. This approach was used to gain a deeper
  understanding on the mechanism of action of the antimicrobial peptide
  tritrpticin (TRP3). TRP3 was labeled with TOAC at the N-terminus (prior to
  V1, TOAC0-TRP3) or internally (replacing P5, TOAC5-TRP3). Functional studies
  showed that labeling led to peptides with higher activity against
  Gram-positive bacteria and lower hemolytic activity with respect to TRP3.
  Peptide-induced model membranes permeabilization and ion channel-like
  activity studies corroborated the functional assays qualitatively, showing
  higher activity of the peptides against negatively charged membranes, which
  had the purpose of mimicking bacterial membranes. TOAC presented a greater
  freedom of motion at the N-terminus than at the internal position, as evinced
  by EPR spectra. EPR and fluorescence spectra reported on the peptides
  conformational properties, showing acquisition of a more packed conformation
  in the presence of the secondary structure-inducing solvent, TFE. CD studies
  showed that TOAC0-TRP3 acquires a conformation similar to that of TRP3, both
  in aqueous solution and in TFE, while TOAC5-TRP3 presents a different
  conformation in all environments. While the mechanism of action of TRP3 was
  impacted to some extent by TOAC labeling at the N-terminus, it did change
  upon replacement of P5 by TOAC. The results demonstrated that TOAC-labeling
  could be used to modulate TRP3 activity and mechanism of action and, more
  importantly, the critical role of P5 for TRP3 pore formation. In this article
  we review current understanding of basic principles for the folding of
  membrane proteins, focusing on the more abundant alpha-helical class.
  Membrane proteins, vital to many biological functions and implicated in
  numerous diseases, fold into their active conformations in the complex
  environment of the cell bilayer membrane. While many membrane proteins rely
  on the translocon and chaperone proteins to fold correctly, others can
  achieve their functional form in the absence of any translation apparatus or
  other aides. Nevertheless, the spontaneous folding process is not well
  understood at the molecular level. Recent findings suggest that helix fraying
  and loop formation may be important for overall structure, dynamics and
  regulation of function. Several types of membrane helices with ionizable
  amino acids change their topology with pH. Additionally we note that some
  peptides, including many that are rich in arginine, and a particular analogue
  of gramicidin, are able passively to translocate across cell membranes. The
  findings indicate that a final protein structure in a lipid-bilayer membrane
  is sequence-based, with lipids contributing to stability and regulation.
  While much progress has been made toward understanding the folding process
  for alpha-helical membrane proteins, it remains a work in progress. This
  article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Emergence of Complex Behavior in
  Biomembranes edited by Marjorie Longo. The three-state kinetic model
  developed in our previous paper (R. Guidelli and L. Becucci, 2016), which
  explains all the main features of experimental current-voltage curves of
  peptide ion channels at conventional bilayer lipid membranes (BLMs), is
  extended to explain some still unsettled features of the corresponding
  voltage-step current-time (I-t) curves. To this end, the time dependence of
  the open probability of peptide ion channels during the first few seconds
  from the instant of the voltage step, before the attainment of its
  steady-state value expressed by the well-known one-sided Boltzmann equation,
  is taken into account. This approach explains the reason for the different
  behavior of the experimental sigmoidal I-t curves with respect to the wholly
  concave downward ones; the frequent occurrence of concave downward I-t curves
  characterized by a time course describable by a sum of two exponential
  functions is also justified. On the other hand, the three-state kinetic model
  disproves the validity of the experimental procedure aiming at estimating the
  gating charge of peptide ion channels from the initial stage of the time
  derivative of ON and OFF ionic currents, commonly justified by an unproved
  analogy with gating currents of potassium ion channels. The mechanism of ion
  channel formation in bilayer lipid membranes is discussed by comparing the
  experimental behavior of current-time and current-voltage curves with the
  predictions of a model accounting for the kinetics of nucleation of monomeric
  units and growth of the resulting channel-forming aggregates. A distinction
  is made between channel-forming peptides, whose dipoles are oriented normal
  to the membrane plane by the electric field, and large proteins aggregating
  into Na+, K+, and Ca2 + channels, which have a constant transmembrane
  disposition and merely reorient each other with a parallel side-by-side
  motion under the influence of the electric field. This difference explains
  why the open probability, as expressed in both cases by the one-sided
  Boltzmann equation, attains the unit value at accessible depolarizations in
  protein ion channels, whereas it is much less than unity in peptide ion
  channels. Biological activities of bombolitins from Bombus ardens, B.
  consobrinus, B. terrestris and B. ussurensis (bombolitins A, C, T and U,
  respectively) were examined using hemolytic, anti-microbial, anti-fungal and
  anti-tumor activity assays. Among the four bombolitins tested, bombolitin T
  showed the highest hemolytic and anti-tumor activities. All bombolitins
  exhibited strong anti-microbial and anti-fungal activities, and bombolitin A
  specifically possessed the highest anti-microbial activity against the
  Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli. Circular dichroism spectrometry
  analysis revealed that all four bombolitins had over 61.7\% and 45.5\% of
  {$\alpha$}-helicity in 30 mM sodium dodecyl sulfate and 50\% trifluoroethanol
  buffers, respectively, which form lipid-membrane-mimicking environments.
  Bombolitin T showed the lowest IC50 values of 8.5 {$\mu$}M and 8.8 {$\mu$}M
  against SK-OV-3 and NIH-OVCAR-3 cell lines, respectively, after 72 h of
  treatment, but its relative hemolytic activity at a concentration of 200
  {$\mu$}M was 2.3-fold higher than that of 0.1\% Triton X-100. To design
  selective anti-tumor peptides with reduced hemolytic activity, bombolitin T
  was chosen as a model to be modified by amino acid substitution. The lowest
  hemolytic activity was observed with the addition of a hydrophobic amino acid
  (Ile14) to the C-terminal end as well as the substitution of Ser10 and Leu12
  with a hydrophobic amino acid (Leu) and positively charged amino acid (Lys),
  respectively. This finding implies that the balanced substitution of
  hydrophobic and positively charged amino acids could affect the cytotoxicity.
  This study provides new information on the properties of anti-tumor peptides
  in the venoms of bumblebees and the basic approaches for peptide design tools
  for the reduction of cytotoxicity.%

    We use the well-known structural and functional properties of the
  gramicidin A channel to test the appropriateness of force fields commonly
  used in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of ion channels. For this
  purpose, the high-resolution structure of the gramicidin A dimer is embedded
  in a dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine bilayer, and the potential of mean force
  of a K+ ion is calculated along the channel axis using the umbrella sampling
  method. Calculations are performed using two of the most common force fields
  in MD simulations: CHARMM and GROMACS. Both force fields lead to large
  central barriers for K+ ion permeation, that are substantially higher than
  those deduced from the physiological data by inverse methods. In long MD
  simulations lasting over 60ns, several ions are observed to enter the binding
  site but none of them crossed the channel despite the presence of a large
  driving field. The present results, taken together with many earlier studies,
  highlights the shortcomings of the standard force fields used in MD
  simulations of ion channels and calls for construction of more appropriate
  force fields for this purpose.%

  551 7. References 551 Ion channels are proteins that form `holes' in
  membranes through which selected ions move passively down their
  electrochemical gradients. The ions move quickly, at (nearly) diffusion
  limited rates ( ca . 10 7 ions s -1 per channel). Ion channels are central to
  many properties of cell membranes. Traditionally they have been the concern
  of neuroscientists, as they control the electrical properties of the
  membranes of excitable cells (neurones, muscle; Hille, 1992). However, it is
  evident that ion channels are present in many types of cell, not all of which
  are electrically excitable, from diverse organisms, including plants,
  bacteria and viruses (where they are involved in functions such as cell
  homeostasis) in addition to animals. Thus ion channels are of general cell
  biological importance. They are also of biomedical interest, as several
  dizeases (`channelopathies') have been described which are caused by changes
  in properties of a specific ion channel (Ashcroft, 2000). Moreover, passive
  diffusion channels for substances other than ions are common (porins,
  aquaporins), as are active membrane transport processes coupled to ion
  gradients or ATP hydrolysis. An understanding of ion channels may also
  provide a gateway to understanding these processes.%

    The voltage-gated potassium channel Kv1.3 is a well-established target for
  treatment of autoimmune diseases. ShK peptide from a sea anemone is one of
  the most potent blockers of Kv1.3 but its application as a therapeutic agent
  for autoimmune diseases is limited by its lack of selectivity against other
  Kv channels, in particular Kv1.1. Accurate models of Kv1.x-ShK complexes
  suggest that specific charge mutations on ShK could considerably enhance its
  specificity for Kv1.3. Here we evaluate the K18A mutation on ShK, and
  calculate the change in binding free energy associated with this mutation
  using the path-independent free energy perturbation and thermodynamic
  integration methods, with a novel implementation that avoids convergence
  problems. To check the accuracy of the results, the binding free energy
  differences were also determined from path-dependent potential of mean force
  calculations. The two methods yield consistent results for the K18A mutation
  in ShK and predict a 2 kcal/mol gain in Kv1.3/Kv1.1 selectivity free energy
  relative to wild-type peptide. Functional assays confirm the predicted
  selectivity gain for ShK[K18A] and suggest that it will be a valuable lead in
  the development of therapeutics for autoimmune diseases.%

    C-type inactivation in hERG is associated with an asymmetrical
  constricted-like conformation of the selectivity filter. , The fast C-type
  inactivation displayed by the voltage-activated potassium channel hERG plays
  a critical role in the repolarization of cardiac cells, and malfunction
  caused by nonspecific binding of drugs or naturally occurring missense
  mutations affecting inactivation can lead to pathologies. Because of its
  impact on human health, understanding the molecular mechanism of C-type
  inactivation in hERG represents an advance of paramount importance. Here,
  long\textendash time scale molecular dynamics simulations, free energy
  landscape calculations, and electrophysiological experiments are combined to
  address the structural and functional impacts of several disease-associated
  mutations. Results suggest that C-type inactivation in hERG is associated
  with an asymmetrical constricted-like conformation of the selectivity filter,
  identifying F627 side-chain rotation and the hydrogen bond between Y616 and
  N629 as key determinants. Comparison of hERG with other K + channels suggests
  that C-type inactivation depends on the degree of opening of the
  intracellular gate via the filter-gate allosteric coupling.%

    Abstract The exquisite fine tuning of biological electrical signalling is
  mediated by variations in the rates of opening and closing of different ion
  channels(1). In addition to open and closed conformations, ion channels can
  exist in an inactivated state, which prevents conduction in the presence of a
  prolonged activating stimulus(2). Human ether-a-go-go related gene (HERG) K+
  channels undergo uniquely rapid and voltage dependent inactivation(3-5),
  which confers upon them a critical role in protecting against cardiac
  arrhythmias and sudden death(6). Previous structural studies have captured
  only the open state of the HERG channel(7,8). Here, we have exploited the K+
  sensitivity of HERG inactivation to determine structures of both the
  conductive state and the elusive inactivated state of HERG. We show that hERG
  inactivation is facilitated by two competing networks of hydrogen bonds
  behind the selectivity filter that enable rapid and voltage dependent
  flipping of the valine carbonyls in the centre of the selectivity filter. Our
  data also explains how changes in extracellular K+ affects the distribution
  between conductive and inactivated states(9,10) and thereby explains why
  hypokalaemia reduces HERG channel activity thereby increasing the risk of
  cardiac arrhythmias(11).%

    \field{abstract}{%
    Atomic-level studies of protein activity represent a significant challenge
  as a result of the complexity of conformational changes occurring on
  wide-ranging timescales, often greatly exceeding that of even the longest
  simulations. A prime example is the elucidation of protein allosteric
  mechanisms, where localized perturbations transmit throughout a large
  macromolecule to generate a response signal. For example, the conversion of
  chemical to electrical signals during synaptic neurotransmission in the brain
  is achieved by specialized membrane proteins called pentameric ligand-gated
  ion channels. Here, the binding of a neurotransmitter results in a global
  conformational change to open an ion-conducting pore across the nerve cell
  membrane. X-ray crystallography has produced static structures of the open
  and closed states of the proton-gated GLIC pentameric ligand-gated ion
  channel protein, allowing for atomistic simulations that can uncover changes
  related to activation. We discuss a range of enhanced sampling approaches
  that could be used to explore activation mechanisms. In particular, we
  describe recent application of an atomistic string method, based on Roux's
  ``swarms of trajectories'' approach, to elucidate the sequence and
  interdependence of conformational changes during activation. We illustrate
  how this can be combined with transition analysis and Brownian dynamics to
  extract thermodynamic and kinetic information, leading to understanding of
  what controls ion channel function. \textcopyright{} 2019 Wiley Periodicals,

    Glutamate is the most abundant excitatory neurotransmitter in the central
  nervous system, and its precise control is vital to maintain normal brain
  function and to prevent excitotoxicity1. The removal of extracellular
  glutamate is achieved by plasma-membrane-bound transporters, which couple
  glutamate transport to sodium, potassium and pH gradients using an elevator
  mechanism2\textendash 5. Glutamate transporters also conduct chloride ions by
  means of a channel-like process that is thermodynamically uncoupled from
  transport6\textendash 8. However, the molecular mechanisms that enable these
  dual-function transporters to carry out two seemingly contradictory roles are
  unknown. Here we report the cryo-electron microscopy structure of a glutamate
  transporter homologue in an open-channel state, which reveals an aqueous
  cavity that is formed during the glutamate transport cycle. The functional
  properties of this cavity, combined with molecular dynamics simulations,
  reveal it to be an aqueous-accessible chloride permeation pathway that is
  gated by two hydrophobic regions and is conserved across mammalian and
  archaeal glutamate transporters. Our findings provide insight into the
  mechanism by which glutamate transporters support their dual function, and
  add information that will assist in mapping the complete transport cycle
  shared by the solute carrier 1A transporter family.%

  aqueous interface and cation binding region. The structure of Gly15-GA
  incorporated into SDS micelles has been determined using a combination of
  2D-NMR spectroscopy and molecular modeling. Like the parent GA, Gly15-GA
  forms a dimeric channel composed of two single-stranded, right-handed
  {$\beta$}6.3-helices joined by hydrogen bonds between their N-termini. The
  replacement of Trp15 by Gly does not have a significant effect on backbone
  structure or side chain conformations with the exception of Trp11 in which
  the indole ring is rotated away from the channel axis. Measurement of the
  equilibrium binding constants and {$\Delta$}G for the binding of monovalent
  cations to GA and Gly15-GA channels incorporated into PC vesicles using 205Tl
  NMR spectroscopy shows that monovalent cations bind much more weakly to the
  Gly15-GA channel entrance than to GA channels. Utilizing the magnetization
  inversion transfer NMR technique, the transport of Na+ ions through GA and
  Gly15-GA channels incorporated into PC/PG vesicles has been investigated. The
  Gly15 substitution produces an increase in the activation enthalpy of
  transport and thus a significant decrease in the transport rate of the Na+
  ion is observed. The single-channel appearances show that the conducting
  channels have a single, well-defined structure. Consistent with the NMR
  results, the single-channel conductances are reduced by 30\% and the
  lifetimes by 70\%. It is concluded that the decrease in cation binding,
  transport, and conductance in Gly15-GA results from the removal of the Trp15
  dipole and, to a lesser extent, the change in orientation of Trp11.%

    The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is an anion
  channel important in maintaining proper functions of the lung, pancreas, and
  intestine. The activity of CFTR is regulated by ATP and protein kinase
  A-dependent phosphorylation. To understand the conformational changes
  elicited by phosphorylation and ATP binding, we present here the structure of
  phosphorylated, ATP-bound human CFTR, determined by cryoelectron microscopy
  to 3.2-\AA{} resolution. This structure reveals the position of the R domain
  after phosphorylation. By comparing the structures of human CFTR and
  zebrafish CFTR determined under the same condition, we identified common
  features essential to channel gating. The differences in their structures
  indicate plasticity permitted in evolution to achieve the same function.
  Finally, the structure of CFTR provides a better understanding of why the
  G178R, R352Q, L927P, and G970R/D mutations would impede conformational
  changes of CFTR and lead to cystic fibrosis.%

    Gramicidin A is an antimicrobial peptide that destroys gram-positive
  bacteria. The bactericidal mechanism of antimicrobial peptides has been
  linked to membrane permeation and metabolism disruption as well as
  interruption of DNA and protein functions. However, the exact bacterial
  killing mechanism of gramicidin A is not clearly understood. In the present
  study, we examined the antimicrobial activity of gramicidin A on
  Staphylococcus aureus using biochemical and biophysical methods, including
  hydroxyl radical and NAD+/NADH cycling assays, atomic force microscopy, and
  Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Gramicidin A induced membrane
  permeabilization and changed the composition of the membrane. The morphology
  of Staphylococcus aureus during gramicidin A destruction was divided into
  four stages: pore formation, water permeability, bacterial flattening, and
  lysis. Changes in membrane composition included the destruction of membrane
  lipids, proteins, and carbohydrates. Most interestingly, we demonstrated that
  gramicidin A not only caused membrane permeabilization but also induced the
  formation of hydroxyl radicals, which are a possible end product of the
  transient depletion of NADH from the tricarboxylic acid cycle. The latter may
  be the main cause of complete Staphylococcus aureus killing. This new finding
  may provide insight into the underlying bactericidal mechanism of gA.%

    Proteins are finicky molecules; they are barely stable and are prone to
  aggregate, but they must function in a crowded environment that is full of
  degradative enzymes bent on their destruction. It is no surprise that many
  common diseases are due to missense mutations that affect protein stability
  and aggregation. Here we review the literature on biophysics as it relates to
  molecular evolution, focusing on how protein stability and aggregation affect
  organismal fitness. We then advance a biophysical model of protein evolution
  that helps us to understand phenomena that range from the dynamics of
  molecular adaptation to the clock-like rate of protein evolution.%

    Some scientists believe that although evolutionary theory is explanatory,
  it does not have, in contrast to the theories of physics, any predictive
  power. This raises the question of its testability. The analysis given shows
  that there are good reasons to claim the unpredictability of evolutionary
  events; nevertheless, the evolutionary theory has potential predictive power.
  It is argued that the difference between biology and physics lies not in the
  predictive power of the theories involved, but in the different weight which
  is lent to the forecasting of particular events in these sciences. A second
  source of confusion derives from the ambiguity of the term `prediction'. In
  order to define `prediction' for cases in which the term is used to refer to
  a part of testing procedure, the reference to the time-point ``now'' is quite
  irrelevant. Prediction of unknown observational data is sufficient for
  testing a hypothesis, but such prediction may or may not be identical with
  forecasting of future events. Different factors that may cause particular
  difficulties met by biologists in forecasting future events are analyzed
  subsequently in the second part of the paper. The conclusion is drawn that
  although particular cognitive situations limiting the ability of forecasting
  are very frequent in biological sciences, the claim about the peculiar
  logical status of biological theories is not thereby justified.%

    Quantitative systems biology, in which predictive mathematical models are
  constructed to guide the design of experiments and predict experimental
  outcomes, is at an exciting transition point, where the foundational
  scientific principles are becoming established, but the impact is not yet
  global. The next steps necessary for mathematical modeling to transform
  biological research and applications, in the same way it has already
  transformed other fields, is not completely clear. The purpose of this
  perspective is to forecast possible answers to this question\textemdash what
  needs to happen next\textemdash by drawing on the experience gained in
  another field, specifically meteorology. We review here a number of lessons
  learned in weather prediction that are directly relevant to biological
  systems modeling, and that we believe can enable the same kinds of global
  impact in our field as atmospheric modeling makes today.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    Proteins are essential to life, and understanding their structure can
  facilitate a mechanistic understanding of their function. Through an enormous
  experimental effort1\textendash 4, the structures of around 100,000 unique
  proteins have been determined5, but this represents a small fraction of the
  billions of known protein sequences6,7. Structural coverage is bottlenecked
  by the months to years of painstaking effort required to determine a single
  protein structure. Accurate computational approaches are needed to address
  this gap and to enable large-scale structural bioinformatics. Predicting the
  three-dimensional structure that a protein will adopt based solely on its
  amino acid sequence\textemdash the structure prediction component of the
  `protein folding problem'8\textemdash has been an important open research
  problem for more than 50~years9. Despite recent progress10\textendash 14,
  existing methods fall far~short of atomic accuracy, especially when no
  homologous structure is available. Here we provide the first computational
  method that can regularly predict protein structures with atomic accuracy
  even in cases in which no similar structure is known. We validated an
  entirely redesigned version of our neural network-based model, AlphaFold, in
  the challenging 14th Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction
  (CASP14)15, demonstrating accuracy competitive with experimental structures
  in a majority of cases and greatly outperforming other methods. Underpinning
  the latest version of AlphaFold is a novel machine learning approach that
  incorporates physical and biological knowledge about protein structure,
  leveraging multi-sequence alignments, into the design of the deep learning
  algorithm.%

    Computational simulations, akin to wetlab experimentation, are subject to
  statistical fluctuations. Assessing the magnitude of these fluctuations, that
  is, assigning uncertainties to the computed results, is of critical
  importance to drawing statistically reliable conclusions. Here, we use a
  simulation box size as an independent variable, to demonstrate how crucial it
  is to gather sufficient amounts of data before drawing any conclusions about
  the potential thermodynamic and kinetic effects. In various systems, ranging
  from solvation free energies to protein conformational transition rates, we
  showcase how the proposed simulation box size effect disappears with
  increased sampling. This indicates that, if at all, the simulation box size
  only minimally affects both the thermodynamics and kinetics of the type of
  biomolecular systems presented in this work.%

    As access to computational resources continues to increase, free-energy
  calculations have emerged as a powerful tool that can play a predictive role
  in a wide range of research areas. Yet, the reliability of these calculations
  can often be improved significantly if a number of precepts, or good
  practices, are followed. Although the theory upon which these good practices
  rely has largely been known for many years, it is often overlooked or simply
  ignored. In other cases, the theoretical developments are too recent for
  their potential to be fully grasped and merged into popular platforms for the
  computation of free-energy differences. In this contribution, the current
  best practices for carrying out free-energy calculations using free energy
  perturbation and nonequilibrium work methods are discussed, demonstrating
  that at little to no additional cost, free-energy estimates could be markedly
  improved and bounded by meaningful error estimates. Monitoring the
  probability distributions that underlie the transformation between the states
  of interest, performing the calculation bidirectionally, stratifying the
  reaction pathway, and choosing the most appropriate paradigms and algorithms
  for transforming between states offer significant gains in both accuracy and
  precision. \textcopyright{} 2010 American Chemical Society.%

    Linear-scaling density functional theory (DFT) is an efficient method to
  describe the electronic structures of molecules, semiconductors, and
  insulators to avoid the high cubic-scaling cost in conventional DFT
  calculations. Here, we present a parallel implementation of linear-scaling
  density matrix trace correcting (TC) purification algorithm to solve the
  Kohn\textendash Sham (KS) equations with the numerical atomic orbitals in the
  HONPAS package. Such a linear-scaling density matrix purification algorithm
  is based on the Kohn's nearsightedness principle, resulting in a sparse
  Hamiltonian matrix with localized basis sets in the DFT calculations.
  Therefore, sparse matrix multiplication is the most time-consuming step in
  the density matrix purification algorithm for linear-scaling DFT
  calculations. We propose to use the MPI\_Allgather function for parallel
  programming to deal with the sparse matrix multiplication within the
  compressed sparse row (CSR) format, which can scale up to hundreds of
  processing cores on modern heterogeneous supercomputers. We demonstrate the
  computational accuracy and efficiency of this parallel density matrix
  purification algorithm by performing large-scale DFT calculations on boron
  nitrogen nanotubes containing tens of thousands of atoms.%

    We present a detailed description and comparison of algorithms for

  based on the ideas of Pulay's residual minimization, which is close to an

    Protein force fields have been undergoing continual development since the
  first complete parameter sets were introduced nearly four decades ago. The
  functional forms that underlie these models have many common elements for the
  treatment of bonded and nonbonded forces, which are reviewed here. The most
  widely used force fields to date use a fixed-charge convention in which
  electronic polarization effects are treated via a mean-field approximation
  during partial charge assignment. Despite success in modeling folded proteins
  over many years, the fixed-charge assumption has limitations that cannot
  necessarily be overcome within their potential energy equations. To overcome
  these limitations, several force fields have recently been derived that
  explicitly treat electronic polarization effects with straightforward
  extensions of the potential energy functions used by nonpolarizable force
  fields. Here, we review the history of the most popular nonpolarizable force
  fields (AMBER, CHARMM, OPLS, and GROMOS) as well as studies that have
  validated them and applied them to studies of protein folding and misfolding.
  Building upon these force fields are more recent polarizable interaction
  potentials, including fluctuating charge models, POSSIM, AMOEBA, and the
  classical Drude oscillator. These force fields differ in their
  implementations but all attempt to model electronic polarization in a
  computationally tractable manner. Despite their recent emergence in the field
  of protein folding, several studies have already applied these polarizable
  models to challenging problems in this domain, including the role of
  polarization in folding free energies and sequence-specific effects on the
  stability of {$\alpha$}-helical structures.%

    Computational studies of proteins based on empirical force fields represent
  a powerful tool to obtain structure-function relationships at an atomic
  level, and are central in current efforts to solve the protein folding
  problem. The results from studies applying these tools are, however,
  dependent on the quality of the force fields used. In particular, accurate
  treatment of the peptide backbone is crucial to achieve representative
  conformational distributions in simulation studies. To improve the treatment
  of the peptide backbone, quantum mechanical (QM) and molecular mechanical
  (MM) calculations were undertaken on the alanine, glycine, and proline
  dipeptides, and the results from these calculations were combined with
  molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of proteins in crystal and aqueous
  environments. QM potential energy maps of the alanine and glycine dipeptides
  at the LMP2/cc-pVxZ//MP2/6-31G* levels, where x = D, T, and Q, were
  determined, and are compared to available QM studies on these molecules. The
  LMP2/cc-pVQZ//MP2/6-31G* energy surfaces for all three dipeptides were then
  used to improve the MM treatment of the dipeptides. These improvements
  included additional parameter optimization via Monte Carlo simulated
  annealing and extension of the potential energy function to contain peptide
  backbone phi, psi dihedral crossterms or a phi, psi grid-based energy
  correction term. Simultaneously, MD simulations of up to seven proteins in
  their crystalline environments were used to validate the force field
  enhancements. Comparison with QM and crystallographic data showed that an
  additional optimization of the phi, psi dihedral parameters along with the
  grid-based energy correction were required to yield significant improvements
  over the CHARMM22 force field. However, systematic deviations in the
  treatment of phi and psi in the helical and sheet regions were evident.
  Accordingly, empirical adjustments were made to the grid-based energy
  correction for alanine and glycine to account for these systematic
  differences. These adjustments lead to greater deviations from QM data for
  the two dipeptides but also yielded improved agreement with experimental
  crystallographic data. These improvements enhance the quality of the CHARMM
  force field in treating proteins. This extension of the potential energy
  function is anticipated to facilitate improved treatment of biological
  macromolecules via MM approaches in general.%

    Tuberculosis (TB) is a serious communicative disease caused by
  Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Although there are vaccines and drugs available
  to treat the disease, they are not efficient, moreover, multidrug-resistant
  TB (MDR-TB) become a major hurdle in its therapy. These MDR strains utilize
  the multidrug efflux pump as a decisive weapon to fight against
  antitubercular drugs. Tap membrane protein was observed as a crucial
  multidrug efflux pump in M. tuberculosis and its critical implication in
  MDR-MTB development makes it an effective drug target. In the present study,
  we have utilized various in silico approaches to predict the applicability of
  FDA-approved ion channel inhibitors and blockers as therapeutic leads against
  Tuberculosis by targeting multidrug efflux protein; Tap in MTB. Tap protein
  structure is predicted by Phyre2 server followed by model refinement,
  validation, physio-chemical catheterization and target prediction. Further,
  the interaction between Tap protein and ligands were analysed by molecular
  docking and MD simulation run of 100 ns. Based on implication and
  compatibility, 18 FDA-approved ion channel inhibitors and blockers are
  selected as a ligand against the Tap protein and eventually observed five
  ligands; Glimepiride, Flecainide, Flupiritine, Nimodipine and Amlodipine as
  promising compounds which have exhibited the significant stable interaction
  with Tap protein and are proposed to modulate or interfere with its activity.
  These compounds illustrated the substantial docking score and total binding
  enthalpy more than -7 kcal/mol and -42 kcal/mol respectively which implies
  that the selected FDA-approved compounds can spontaneously interact with the
  Tap protein to modulate its function. This study proposed Tap protein as a
  prominent drug target in MTB and investigated compounds that show
  considerable interaction with the Tap protein as potential therapeutic
  molecules. These interactions may lead to modulating or inhibit the activity
  of drug efflux protein thereby making MTB susceptible to antitubercular
  drugs. A deep insight into the 3D structures of the proteins is essential to
  understand their functions and will be helpful in drug design and making
  decisions for the treatment of diseases. The 3D structure for less than
  one-thousandth of the protein sequences has been determined so far due to the
  slow structure elucidation procedures with experimental methods, such as
  X-ray. For this reason, different computational methods were used to
  determine the structure of the proteins, including template-based and de novo
  approaches. Much software has been developed to facilitate the computational
  approaches in protein modeling, some of which need user expertise and
  extensive knowledge in bioinformatics. The present study attempted to provide
  a user-friendly environment to motivate the researchers in computational
  biology, a Python-based interface based on MODELLER software. PyProtModel can
  be used as a toolbox in structural bioinformatics for protein modeling from
  sequence to the prediction of 3D structure. In addition, the users can take
  benefits of PyProtModel in order to prepare and evaluate protein PDB files
  prior to other in silico experiments. PyProtModel allows the user to apply
  different MODELLER options, automates, and speeds up time-consuming homology
  modeling steps. Different aspects of PyProtModel and a comprehensive view of
  the application will be discussed in this paper. The application is available
  for download and use at: https://github.com/msisakht/pyprotmodel.git. Typhoid
  disease caused by the bacterium Salmonella typhi becomes fatal if not treated
  timely. To expedite its timely and accurate diagnosis at an early stage, a
  biomimetic sensor based on epitope imprinting technique is developed for the
  detection of typhoid. Epitope sequence of Salmonella invasive protein D
  (SipD) was predicted using immunoinformatic tools and utilized for
  imprinting. A molecularly imprinted matrix was developed on the surface of
  quartz crystal microbalance chip through electropolymerization in presence of
  template - a 14-mer synthetic peptide predicted. Binding of {$\sim$} -3000 Hz
  from the blood plasma sample of infected persons showed the selectivity of
  imprinted sites towards the SipD proteins of bacteria. The sensor was able to
  detect bacteria at an early stage with an LOD value of 0.50 (ng/ml). On
  extraction of the peptide sequence, imprinted cavities were able to
  selectively and specifically bind targeted epitope sequences in laboratory
  samples as well as `real' samples of patients. An accurate, robust,
  cost-effective, facile diagnostic tool to aid the healthcare industry is
  presented here. Recent developments in the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic point to its
  inevitable transformation into an endemic disease, urging both refinement of
  diagnostics for emerging variants of concern (VOCs) and design of
  variant-specific drugs in addition to vaccine adjustments. Exploring the
  structure and dynamics of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein, we argue that the
  high-mutability characteristic of RNA viruses coupled with the remarkable
  flexibility and dynamics of viral proteins result in a substantial
  involvement of allosteric mechanisms. While allosteric effects of mutations
  should be considered in predictions and diagnostics of new VOCs, allosteric
  drugs advantageously avoid escape mutations via non-competitive inhibition
  originating from alternative distal locations. The exhaustive allosteric
  signaling and probing maps presented herein provide a comprehensive picture
  of allostery in the spike protein, making it possible to locate potential
  mutations that could work as new VOC ``drivers'' and to determine binding
  patches that may be targeted by newly developed allosteric drugs.
  Structure-based antibody design and accurate predictions of antibody-antigen
  interactions remain major challenges in computational biology. By using
  molecular dynamics simulations, we show that a single static X-ray structure
  is not sufficient to identify determinants of antibody-antigen recognition.
  Here, we investigate antibodies that undergo substantial conformational
  changes upon antigen binding and have been classified as difficult cases in
  an extensive benchmark for antibody-antigen docking. We present
  thermodynamics and transition kinetics of these conformational rearrangements
  and show that paratope states can be used to improve antibody-antigen
  docking. By using the unbound antibody X-ray structure as starting structure
  for molecular dynamics simulations, we retain a binding competent
  conformation substantially different to the unbound antibody X-ray structure.
  We also observe that the kinetically dominant antibody paratope conformations
  are chosen by the bound antigen conformation with the highest probability.
  Thus, we show that paratope states in solution can improve antibody-antigen
  docking and structure prediction.%

    In contrast to ordinary polymers, the vast majority of biological
  macromolecules adopt highly ordered three-dimensional structures that define
  their functions. The key to folding of a biopolymer into a unique 3D
  structure or to an assembly of several biopolymers into a functional unit is
  a delicate balance between the attractive and repulsive forces that also
  makes such self-assembly reversible under physiological conditions. The
  all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) method has emerged as a powerful tool for
  studies of individual biomolecules and their functional assemblies,
  encompassing systems of ever increasing complexity. However, advances in
  parallel computing technology have outpaced the development of the underlying
  theoretical models - the molecular force fields, pushing the MD method into
  an untested territory. Recent tests of the MD method have found the most
  commonly used molecular force fields to be out of balance, overestimating
  attractive interactions between charged and hydrophobic groups, which can
  promote artificial aggregation in MD simulations of multi-component protein,
  nucleic acid, and lipid systems. One route towards improving the force fields
  is through the NBFIX corrections method, in which the intermolecular forces
  are calibrated against experimentally measured quantities such as osmotic
  pressure by making atom pair-specific adjustments to the non-bonded
  interactions. In this article, we review development of the NBFIX (Non-Bonded
  FIX) corrections to the AMBER and CHARMM force fields and discuss their
  implications for MD simulations of electrolyte solutions, dense DNA systems,
  Holliday junctions, protein folding, and lipid bilayer membranes.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    Overbinding of ions is a common and well-known problem in classical
  molecular dynamics simulations. One of its main causes is the absence of
  electronic polarizability in the force fields. The current approaches for
  minimizing overbinding typically either retain the original charges and use
  an ad hoc readjustment of the Lennard-Jones parameters as done in the
  nonbonded fix (NBFIX) approach or rescale the charges using a theoretical
  framework. The goal in the latter is to include shielding produced by the
  missing electronic polarizability as done in the electronic continuum
  correction (ECC) approach. NBFIX and ECC are the most common corrections, and
  we compare their performance to the default parameterizations provided by
  five different commonly used biomolecular force fields, OPLS-AA/L, CHARMM27,
  CHARMM36m, CHARMM22*, and AMBER99SB-ILDN. As test systems, we use
  poly-{$\alpha$},l-glutamic and poly-{$\alpha$},l-aspartic amino acid
  molecules in explicit water together with Na+ and K+ counterions. We
  demonstrate that the different force fields yield results that are not only
  quantitatively but also qualitatively different. The resulting structures of
  the macroions depend strongly on the model for ions. NBFIX corrections
  alleviate the problem of overbinding, resulting in extended peptides. The ECC
  corrections depend nontrivially on the original underlying model, and despite
  being based on a theoretical framework, they cannot always solve the
  problem.%

    In the present study we report on interactions of and competition between
  monovalent ions for two DNA sequences in MD simulations. Efforts included the
  development and validation of parameters for interactions among the
  first-group monovalent cations, Li+, Na+, K+, and Rb+, and DNA in the Drude
  polarizable and additive CHARMM36 force fields (FF). The optimization process
  targeted gas-phase QM interaction energies of various model compounds with
  ions and osmotic pressures of bulk electrolyte solutions of chemically
  relevant ions. The optimized ionic parameters are validated against
  counterion condensation theory and buffer exchange\textendash atomic emission
  spectroscopy measurements providing quantitative data on the competitive
  association of different monovalent ions with DNA. Comparison between
  experimental and MD simulation results demonstrates that, compared to the
  additive CHARMM36 model, the Drude FF provides an improved description of the
  general features of the ionic atmosphere around DNA and leads to closer
  agreement with experiment on the ionic competition within the ion atmosphere.
  Results indicate the importance of extended simulation systems on the order
  of 25 \AA{} beyond the DNA surface to obtain proper convergence of ion
  distributions.%

    A simple two-temperature model makes an equal mixture of identical LJ
  particles phase separate and develop crystalline order in cold clusters. , We
  report scalar activity induced phase separation and crystallization in a
  system of 3-d Lennard-Jones particles taken at state points spanning from the
  gas to the liquid regime using molecular dynamics simulation (MD). Scalar
  activity was introduced by increasing the temperature of half of the
  particles (labeled `hot') while keeping the temperature of the other half
  constant at a lower value (labeled `cold'). The relative temperature
  difference between the two subsystems is considered as a measure of the
  activity. From our simulations we observe that the two species tend to phase
  separate at sufficiently high activity ratio. The extent of separation is
  quantified by the defined order parameter and the entropy production during
  this process is determined by employing the two-phase thermodynamic (2PT)
  model and the standard modified Benedict\textendash Webb\textendash Rubin
  (MBWR) equation of state for a LJ fluid. We observe that the extent of the
  phase separation and entropy production increases with the density of the
  system. From a cluster analysis, we obtain the mean number of clusters
  {$\langle$} n cl {$\rangle$}, and the mean size of the largest cluster
  {$\langle$} n 0 {$\rangle$} in the system, complementing each other. Bond
  orientation order parameters reveal that the so formed largest cluster also
  develops solid-like order consisting of both FCC and HCP packing. The
  presence of such crystalline order is also supported by a common neighbor
  analysis.%

    A simple and accurate expression for radial distribution function (RDF) of
  the Lennard-Jones fluid is presented. The expression explicitly states the
  RDF as a continuous function of reduced interparticle distance, temperature,
  and density. It satisfies the limiting conditions of zero density and
  infinite distance imposed by statistical thermodynamics. The distance
  dependence of this expression is expressed by an equation which contains 11
  adjustable parameters. These parameters are fitted to 353 RDF data, obtained
  by molecular dynamics calculations, and then expressed as functions of
  reduced distance, temperature and density. This expression, having a total of
  65 constants, reproduces the RDF data with an average root-mean-squared
  deviation of 0.0152 for the range of state variables of
  0.5{$\leqslant$}T{${_\ast}\leqslant$}5.1 and
  0.35{$\leqslant\rho{_\ast}\leqslant$}1.1 (T{${_\ast}$}=kT/{$\epsilon$} and
  {$\rho{_\ast}$}={$\rho\sigma$}3 are reduced temperature and density,
  respectively). The expression predicts the pressure and the internal energy
  of the Lennard-Jones fluid with an uncertainty that is comparable to that
  obtained directly from the molecular dynamics simulations.%

    The widely used CHARMM additive all-atom force field includes parameters
  for proteins, nucleic acids, lipids, and carbohydrates. In the present
  article, an extension of the CHARMM force field to drug-like molecules is
  presented. The resulting CHARMM General Force Field (CGenFF) covers a wide
  range of chemical groups present in biomolecules and drug-like molecules,
  including a large number of heterocyclic scaffolds. The parametrization
  philosophy behind the force field focuses on quality at the expense of
  transferability, with the implementation concentrating on an extensible force
  field. Statistics related to the quality of the parametrization with a focus
  on experimental validation are presented. Additionally, the parametrization
  procedure, described fully in the present article in the context of the model
  systems, pyrrolidine, and 3-phenoxymethylpyrrolidine will allow users to
  readily extend the force field to chemical groups that are not explicitly
  covered in the force field as well as add functional groups to and link
  together molecules already available in the force field. CGenFF thus makes it
  possible to perform "all-CHARMM" simulations on drug-target interactions
  thereby extending the utility of CHARMM force fields to medicinally relevant
  systems.%

    Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) are implicated in many human
  diseases. They have generally not been amenable to conventional
  structure-based drug design, however, because their intrinsic conformational
  variability has precluded an atomic-level understanding of their binding to
  small molecules. Here we present long-time-scale, atomic-level molecular
  dynamics (MD) simulations of monomeric {$\alpha$}-synuclein (an IDP whose
  aggregation is associated with Parkinson's disease) binding the
  small-molecule drug fasudil in which the observed protein\textendash ligand
  interactions were found to be in good agreement with previously reported NMR
  chemical shift data. In our simulations, fasudil, when bound, favored certain
  charge\textendash charge and {$\pi$}-stacking interactions near the C
  terminus of {$\alpha$}-synuclein but tended not to form these interactions
  simultaneously, rather breaking one of these interactions and forming another
  nearby (a mechanism we term dynamic shuttling). Further simulations with
  small molecules chosen to modify these interactions yielded binding
  affinities and key structural features of binding consistent with subsequent
  NMR experiments, suggesting the potential for MD-based strategies to
  facilitate the rational design of small molecules that bind with disordered
  proteins.%

    Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation is a valuable tool for characterizing
  the structural dynamics of folded proteins and should be similarly applicable
  to disordered proteins and proteins with both folded and disordered regions.
  It has been unclear, however, whether any physical model (force field) used
  in MD simulations accurately describes both folded and disordered proteins.
  Here, we select a benchmark set of 21 systems, including folded and
  disordered proteins, simulate these systems with six state-of-the-art force
  fields, and compare the results to over 9,000 available experimental data
  points. We find that none of the tested force fields simultaneously provided
  accurate descriptions of folded proteins, of the dimensions of disordered
  proteins, and of the secondary structure propensities of disordered proteins.
  Guided by simulation results on a subset of our benchmark, however, we
  modified parameters of one force field, achieving excellent agreement with
  experiment for disordered proteins, while maintaining state-of-the-art
  accuracy for folded proteins. The resulting force field, a99SB-disp, should
  thus greatly expand the range of biological systems amenable to MD
  simulation. A similar approach could be taken to improve other force fields.%

    Accurate force field parameters for proteins and drugs are of fundamental
  importance for predicting protein-drug binding poses and binding free
  energies in structure-based drug design. Osmotic pressure simulations have
  recently gained popularity as a means to validate common force fields for
  biomolecules such as proteins; up to now, however, little such effort has
  been made to use these methods to validate common force fields for small
  drug-like molecules. In this work, osmotic coefficients of 16 drug-like
  molecules were calculated from osmotic pressure molecular dynamics
  simulations using four common force fields for drug-like molecules: GAFF,
  CGenFF, OPLS-AA, and PRODRGFF. While GAFF, CGenFF, and OPLS-AA produced
  osmotic coefficients that are in good agreement with the corresponding
  experimental osmotic coefficients, PRODRGFF, which attempts to use GROMOS
  parameters, often produced osmotic coefficients that are in poor agreement.
  All four force fields poorly reproduced the experimental osmotic coefficients
  of purine-derived molecules including purine, 6-methylpurine, and caffeine,
  suggesting common issues in describing interactions of this particular
  molecule type. The poor overall performance of PRODRGFF can be mainly
  attributed to the poor results with two macrocyclic molecules HMT and TAT,
  which can be significantly improved by reparameterizing the van der Waals
  (vdW) parameters of alkyl carbons and using lower solute concentration. In
  addition, the recently developed GAFF2 with revamped vdW parameters was found
  to produce osmotic coefficients that are in slightly better agreement with
  experiments than GAFF. Overall, the four common force fields for drug-like
  molecules tested in this study performed reasonably well at reproducing
  experimental osmotic coefficients of drug-like molecules, although failures
  of certain force fields on certain molecules suggest that further force field
  reparameterizations, especially for vdW parameters, might be required to
  improve their accuracy.%

    Biomolecular simulations are typically performed in an aqueous environment
  where the number of ions remains fixed for the duration of the simulation,
  generally with either a minimally neutralizing ion environment or a number of
  salt pairs intended to match the macroscopic salt concentration. In contrast,
  real biomolecules experience local ion environments where the salt
  concentration is dynamic and may differ from bulk. The degree of salt
  concentration variability and average deviation from the macroscopic
  concentration remains, as yet, unknown. Here, we describe the theory and
  implementation of a Monte Carlo osmostat that can be added to explicit
  solvent molecular dynamics or Monte Carlo simulations to sample from a
  semigrand canonical ensemble in which the number of salt pairs fluctuates
  dynamically during the simulation. The osmostat reproduce the correct
  equilibrium statistics for a simulation volume that can exchange ions with a
  large reservoir at a defined macroscopic salt concentration. To achieve
  useful Monte Carlo acceptance rates, the method makes use of nonequilibrium
  candidate Monte Carlo (NCMC) moves in which monovalent ions and water
  molecules are alchemically transmuted using short nonequilibrium
  trajectories, with a modified Metropolis-Hastings criterion ensuring correct
  equilibrium statistics for an {$\Delta\mu$}, N, p, T) ensemble. We
  demonstrate how typical protein (DHFR and the tyrosine kinase Src) and
  nucleic acid (Drew-Dickerson B-DNA dodecamer) systems exhibit salt
  concentration distributions that significantly differ from fixed-salt bulk
  simulations and display fluctuations that are on the same order of magnitude
  as the average.%

    Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of heptane/vapor, hexadecane/vapor,
  water/vapor, hexadecane/water, and dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC)
  bilayers and monolayers are analyzed to determine the accuracy of treating
  long-range interactions in interfaces with the isotropic periodic sum (IPS)
  method. The method and cutoff (rc) dependences of surface tensions, density
  profiles, water dipole orientation, and electrostatic potential profiles are
  used as metrics. The water/vapor, heptane/vapor, and hexadecane/vapor
  interfaces are accurately and efficiently calculated with 2D IPS (rc = 10 \AA
  ). It is demonstrated that 3D IPS is not practical for any of the interfacial
  systems studied. However, the hybrid method PME/IPS [Particle Mesh Ewald for
  electrostatics and 3D IPS for Lennard-Jones (LJ) interactions] provides an
  efficient way to include both types of long-range forces in simulations of
  large liquid/vacuum and all liquid/liquid interfaces, including lipid
  monolayers and bilayers. A previously published pressure-based long-range LJ
  correction yields results similar to those of PME/IPS for liquid/liquid
  interfaces. The contributions to surface tension of LJ terms arising from
  interactions beyond 10 \AA{} range from 13 dyn/cm for the hexadecane/vapor
  interface to approximately 3 dyn/cm for hexadecane/water and DPPC bilayers
  and monolayers. Surface tensions of alkane/vapor, hexadecane/water, and DPPC
  monolayers based on the CHARMM lipid force fields agree very well with
  experiment, whereas surface tensions of the TIP3P and TIP4P-Ew water models
  underestimate experiment by 16 and 11 dyn/cm, respectively. Dipole potential
  drops ({$\Delta\Psi$}) are less sensitive to long-range LJ interactions than
  surface tensions. However, {$\Delta\Psi$} for the DPPC bilayer (845 {$\pm$} 3
  mV proceeding from water to lipid) and water (547 {$\pm$} 2 mV for TIP4P-Ew
  and 521 {$\pm$} 3 mV for TIP3P) overestimate experiment by factors of 3 and
  5, respectively, and represent expected deficiencies in nonpolarizable force
  fields.%

    3D-IPS/DFFT is an extension of the three-dimensional isotropic periodic sum
  (3D-IPS) for evaluation of electrostatic and Lennard-Jones interactions in
  heterogeneous systems; it utilizes a discrete fast Fourier transform (DFFT)
  for efficient calculation of the IPS potential with a large local region
  radius. The method is demonstrated to be highly accurate for simple bulk
  fluids, liquid/liquid and liquid/vapor interfaces, and lipid bilayers and
  monolayers. Values for rC (the cutoff distance for direct evaluation of
  pairs) and RC (the local region radius) equal to 10 \AA{} and twice the
  longest edge of the periodic cell, respectively, provide excellent efficiency
  and accuracy. Dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC) monolayers simulated with
  the CHARMM (Chemistry at HARvard Molecular Mechanics) C27r lipid parameter
  set and 3D-IPS/DFFT yield surface tensions approximately 8 dyn/cm higher than
  those simulated using particle mesh Ewald (PME), and with experiment. In
  contrast, surface tensions for DMPC bilayers are 16 dyn/cm/leaflet with both
  3D-IPS/DFFT (rC = 10 and 12 \AA ) and PME (rC = 12 \AA ). This indicates that
  PME (rC = 12 \AA ) may be used for simulations of bilayers, but not
  monolayers, and that the large bilayer surface tension arising from C27r is
  incorrect.%

    We report the results from a molecular dynamics (MD) simulation on a 1.0 M
  aqueous NaCl solution using the classical SPC water model and a treatment of
  long-range electrostatic forces involving a 9\textendash 16 \AA{} twin-range
  cut-off. This study was undertaken to explore the importance of truncation
  effects in simulations involving charged species which employ cut-offs at
  longer range than typically used in MD. Artefacts were discerned in the
  ion-ion radial distribution functions at {$\approx$} 16 \AA, indicating that
  increasing the length scale of the truncation scheme does not necessarily
  lead to reliable trajectories. Our results indicate that `charge group-charge
  group' radial distribution functions are a sensitive test for the detection
  of artefacts due to truncation and it is suggested that they should be used
  as a routine screening device in the analysis of MD systems involving charged
  groups.%

    Ewald summation, which has become the de facto standard for computing
  electrostatic interactions in biomolecular simulations, formally requires
  that the simulation box is neutral. For non-neutral systems, the Ewald
  algorithm implicitly introduces a uniform background charge distribution that
  effectively neutralizes the simulation box. Because a uniform distribution of
  counter charges typically deviates from the spatial distribution of
  counterions in real systems, artifacts may arise, in particular in systems
  with an inhomogeneous dielectric constant. Here, we derive an analytical
  expression for the effect of using an implicit background charge instead of
  explicit counterions, on the chemical potential of ions in heterogeneous
  systems, which (i) provides a quantitative criterium for deciding if the
  background charge offers an acceptable trade-off between artifacts arising
  from sampling problems and artifacts arising from the homogeneous background
  charge distribution, and (ii) can be used to correct this artifact in certain
  cases. Our model quantifies the artifact in terms of the difference in charge
  density between the non-neutral system with a uniform neutralizing background
  charge and the real neutral system with a physically correct distribution of
  explicit counterions. We show that for inhomogeneous systems, such as
  proteins and membranes in water, the artifact manifests itself by an
  overstabilization of ions inside the lower dielectric by tens to even
  hundreds kilojoules per mole. We have tested the accuracy of our model in
  molecular dynamics simulations and found that the error in the calculated
  free energy for moving a test charge from water into hexadecane, at different
  net charges of the system and different simulation box sizes, is correctly
  predicted by the model. The calculations further confirm that the incorrect
  distribution of counter charges in the simulation box is solely responsible
  for the errors in the PMFs.%

    The multilevel summation method (MSM) offers an efficient algorithm
  utilizing convolution for evaluating long-range forces arising in molecular
  dynamics simulations. Shifting the balance of computation and communication,
  MSM provides key advantages over the ubiquitous particle-mesh Ewald (PME)
  method, offering better scaling on parallel computers and permitting more
  modeling flexibility, with support for periodic systems as does PME but also
  for semiperiodic and nonperiodic systems. The version of MSM available in the
  simulation program NAMD is described, and its performance and accuracy are
  compared with the PME method. The accuracy feasible for MSM in practical
  applications reproduces PME results for water property calculations of
  density, diffusion constant, dielectric constant, surface tension, radial
  distribution function, and distancedependent Kirkwood factor, even though the
  numerical accuracy of PME is higher than that of MSM. Excellent agreement
  between MSM and PME is found also for interface potentials of air-water and
  membrane-water interfaces, where long-range Coulombic interactions are
  crucial. Applications demonstrate also the suitability of MSM for systems
  with semiperiodic and nonperiodic boundaries. For this purpose, simulations
  have been performed with periodic boundaries along directions parallel to a
  membrane surface but not along the surface normal, yielding membrane pore
  formation induced by an imbalance of charge across the membrane. Using a
  similar semiperiodic boundary condition, ion conduction through a graphene
  nanopore driven by an ion gradient has been simulated. Furthermore, proteins
  have been simulated inside a single spherical water droplet. Finally,
  parallel scalability results show the ability of MSM to outperform PME when
  scaling a system of modest size (less than 100 K atoms) to over a thousand
  processors, demonstrating the suitability of MSM for large-scale parallel
  simulation.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    Traditionally, the dependence of enzyme activity on temperature has been
  described by a model consisting of two processes: the catalytic reaction
  defined by {$\Delta$}GDaggercat, and irreversible inactivation defined by
  {$\Delta$}GDaggerinact. However, such a model does not account for the
  observed temperature-dependent behaviour of enzymes, and a new model has been
  developed and validated. This model (the Equilibrium Model) describes a new
  mechanism by which enzymes lose activity at high temperatures, by including
  an inactive form of the enzyme (Einact) that is in reversible equilibrium
  with the active form (Eact); it is the inactive form that undergoes
  irreversible thermal inactivation to the thermally denatured state. This
  equilibrium is described by an equilibrium constant whose
  temperature-dependence is characterized in terms of the enthalpy of the
  equilibrium, {$\Delta$}Heq, and a new thermal parameter, Teq, which is the
  temperature at which the concentrations of Eact and Einact are equal; Teq may
  therefore be regarded as the thermal equivalent of Km. Characterization of an
  enzyme with respect to its temperature-dependent behaviour must therefore
  include a determination of these intrinsic properties. The Equilibrium Model
  has major implications for enzymology, biotechnology and understanding the
  evolution of enzymes. The present study presents a new direct data-fitting
  method based on fitting progress curves directly to the Equilibrium Model,
  and assesses the robustness of this procedure and the effect of assay data on
  the accurate determination of Teq and its associated parameters. It also
  describes simpler experimental methods for their determination than have been
  previously available, including those required for the application of the
  Equilibrium Model to non-ideal enzyme reactions.%

    To investigate the damage of cell membrane induced by vacuum treatment at
  different pressure reduction rates, the onion epidermis was subjected to
  three different pressure reduction rates in a miniaturized, visual and
  vernier regulation experimental setup. The results of physical tests agreed
  well with the result of optical microscopy, which showed that treatment at
  the medium pressure reduction rate resulted in minimum changes in the spaces
  between the cell membrane and cell wall, water loss, relative electrical
  conductivity, color and micromechanical properties. Experimental results
  showed that the pressure reduction rate had obvious effects on the cell
  membrane integrity of vacuum-treated onion epidermis. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS
  This work tested the effect extent of different pressure rates on the cell
  membrane integrity during vacuum treatment, which has been demonstrated to
  provide many benefits to the food processing industry. This research could
  help the users to choose the appropriate operating parameters, to predict the
  characteristics of vacuum cooled products, to understand the mechanism of
  vacuum treatment and to learn the design of vacuum cooling equipment.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    Molecular simulations are a computational technique used to investigate the
  dynamics of proteins and other molecules. The free energy landscape of these
  simulations is often rugged, and minor differences in the initial velocities,
  floating-point precision, or underlying hardware can cause identical
  simulations (replicas) to take different paths in the landscape. In this
  study we investigated the magnitude of these effects based on 310\,000 ns of
  simulation time. We performed 100 identically parametrized replicas of 3000
  ns each for a small 10 amino acid system as well as 100 identically
  parametrized replicas of 100 ns each for an 827 residue T-cell receptor/MHC
  system. Comparing randomly chosen subgroups within these replica sets, we
  estimated the reproducibility and reliability that can be achieved by a given
  number of replicas at a given simulation time. These results demonstrate that
  conclusions drawn from single simulations are often not reproducible and that
  conclusions drawn from multiple shorter replicas are more reliable than those
  from a single longer simulation. The actual number of replicas needed will
  always depend on the question asked and the level of reliability sought. On
  the basis of our data, it appears that a good rule of thumb is to perform a
  minimum of five to 10 replicas.%

    A molecular dynamics simulation method which can generate configurations
  belonging to the canonical (T, V, N) ensemble or the constant temperature
  constant pressure (T, P, N) ensemble, is proposed. The physical system of
  interest consists of N particles (f degrees of freedom), to which an
  external, macroscopic variable and its conjugate momentum are added. This
  device allows the total energy of the physical system to fluctuate. The
  equilibrium distribution of the energy coincides with the canonical
  distribution both in momentum and in coordinate space. The method is tested

    The authors present a new molecular dynamics algorithm for sampling the
  canonical distribution. In this approach the velocities of all the particles
  are rescaled by a properly chosen random factor. The algorithm is formally
  justified and it is shown that, in spite of its stochastic nature, a quantity
  can still be defined that remains constant during the evolution. In numerical
  applications this quantity can be used to measure the accuracy of the
  sampling. The authors illustrate the properties of this new method on
  Lennard-Jones and TIP4P water models in the solid and liquid phases. Its
  performance is excellent and largely independent of the thermostat parameter

    In molecular dynamics (MD) simulations the need often arises to maintain
  such parameters as temperature or pressure rather than energy and volume, or
  to impose gradients for studying transport properties in nonequilibrium MD. A
  method is described to realize coupling to an external bath with constant
  temperature or pressure with adjustable time constants for the coupling. The
  method is easily extendable to other variables and to gradients, and can be
  applied also to polyatomic molecules involving internal constraints. The
  influence of coupling time constants on dynamical variables is evaluated. A
  leap-frog algorithm is presented for the general case involving constraints
  with coupling to both a constant temperature and a constant pressure bath.

    The kinetics of ruptures of giant vesicles under constant tension have been
  investigated under various conditions, which will help in the application of
  these techniques in the biomedical, bioengineering, and biotechnological
  fields. , External tension in membranes plays a vital role in numerous
  physiological and physicochemical phenomena. In this review, recent
  developments in the constant electric- and mechanical-tension-induced rupture
  of giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) are considered. We summarize the results
  relating to the kinetics of GUV rupture as a function of membrane surface
  charge, ions in the bathing solution, lipid composition, cholesterol content
  in the membrane, and osmotic pressure. The mechanical stability and line
  tension of the membrane under these conditions are discussed. The membrane
  tension due to osmotic pressure and the critical tension of rupture for
  various membrane compositions are also discussed. The results and their
  analysis provide a biophysical description of the kinetics of rupture, along
  with insight into biological processes. Future directions and possible
  developments in this research area are included.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    This chapter discusses that high hydrostatic pressure affects equilibria
  and reaction rates through the molar volume changes involved in the reaction
  system as a whole. The chapter explains how high hydrostatic pressure affects
  molecules of biological interest, and their interactions; the ways in which
  pressure affects cellular processes; and how animals, including humans are
  affected by pressure. Along with high pressure, the chapter also intends to
  stimulate interest in a particular approach to physiology. The discussion on
  molecular effects of pressure and temperature includes equilibrium processes
  in aqueous solution, lipid bilayers under pressure and rates of chemical
  reactions. It is mentioned that hydrostatic pressure is not directional and
  that osmotic pressure is also quite separate from hydrostatic pressure.
  Hydrostatic pressure is a force acting in all directions, in the air one
  breathes, in water, or in body fluids. While high pressure, surprisingly
  perhaps, dissociates molecules in aqueous solution, it has the intuitively
  expected effect on lipid bilayers, compressing and ordering their structure.
  The thermodynamics of equilibrium processes in aqueous solution, and the
  phase state of lipid bilayers at high pressure, inevitably fall short of
  explaining how pressure affects rates of reaction. Muscle, a tissue whose
  cells are conspicuously filled with polymerized proteins, is affected by high
  pressure in ways determined by the contraction cycle. Simple processes, such
  as the diffusion of gases or water in aqueous solution, are little affected
  by the pressure range of interest here. Chondrocytes are cells, which
  synthesize the load-bearing extracellular matrixthat covers the articulating
  surfaces of joints. The buoyancy of aquatic animals subjected to significant
  pressure is interesting because buoyancy requires the creation of a void or
  region of low-density, working against the ambient pressure. Animals and
  bacteria live at high pressures in the deep sea, down to the greatest depths
  where the pressure is approximately 100 MPa. Several technological
  applications have arisen from high pressure biology\textemdash the
  manipulation of ploidy, and of membrane proteins; sterilization and
  inactivation of microorganisms; food processing; and safe human diving.%

    A new Lagrangian formulation is introduced. It can be used to make
  molecular dynamics (MD) calculations on systems under the most general,
  externally applied, conditions of stress. In this formulation the MD cell
  shape and size can change according to dynamical equations given by this
  Lagrangian. This new MD technique is well suited to the study of structural
  transformations in solids under external stress and at finite temperature. As
  an example of the use of this technique we show how a single crystal of Ni
  behaves under uniform uniaxial compressive and tensile loads. This work
  confirms some of the results of static (i.e., zero temperature) calculations
  reported in the literature. We also show that some results regarding the
  stress-strain relation obtained by static calculations are invalid at finite
  temperature. We find that, under compressive loading, our model of Ni shows a
  bifurcation in its stress-strain relation; this bifurcation provides a link
  in configuration space between cubic and hexagonal close packing. It is
  suggested that such a transformation could perhaps be observed experimentally
  under extreme conditions of shock.%

    A method is developed for representing any communication system
  geometrically. Messages and the corresponding signals are points in two
  "function spaces," and the modulation process is a mapping of one space into
  the other. Using this representation, a number of results in communication
  theory are deduced concerning expansion and compression of bandwidth and the
  threshold effect. Formulas are found for the maxmum rate of transmission of
  binary digits over a system when the signal is perturbed by various types of
  noise. Some of the properties of "ideal" systems which transmit at this
  maxmum rate are discussed. The equivalent number of binary digits per second

    The St\"ormer\textendash Verlet\textendash leapfrog group of integrators
  commonly used in molecular dynamics simulations has long become a textbook
  subject and seems to have been studied exhaustively. There are, however, a
  few striking effects in performance of algorithms which are well known but
  have not received adequate attention in the literature. A closer view of
  these unclear observations results in unexpected conclusions. It is shown
  here that contrary to the conventional point of view, the leapfrog scheme is
  distinguished in this group both in terms of the order of truncation errors
  and the conservation of the total energy. In this case the characteristic
  square growth of fluctuations of the total energy with the step size,
  commonly measured in numerical tests, results from additional interpolation
  errors with no relation to the accuracy of the computed trajectory. An
  alternative procedure is described for checking energy conservation of
  leapfrog-like algorithms which is free from interpolation errors. Preliminary
  tests on a representative model system suggest that standard step size values
  used at present are lower than necessary for accurate sampling.%

    A systematic analysis is performed on the effectiveness of removing degrees
  of freedom from hydrogen atoms and/or increasing hydrogen masses to increase
  the efficiency of molecular dynamics simulations of hydrogen-rich systems
  such as proteins in water. In proteins, high-frequency bond-angle vibrations
  involving hydrogen atoms limit the time step to 3 fs, which is already a
  factor of 1.5 beyond the commonly used time step of 2 fs. Removing these
  degrees of freedom from the system by constructing hydrogen atoms as dummy
  atoms, allows the time step to be increased to 7 fs, a factor of 3.5 compared
  with 2 fs. Additionally, a gain in simulation stability can be achieved by
  increasing the masses of hydrogen atoms with remaining degrees of freedom
  from 1 to 4 u. Increasing hydrogen mass without removing the high-frequency
  degrees of freedom allows the time step to be increased only to 4 fs, a
  factor of two, compared with 2 fs. The net gain in efficiency of sampling
  configurational space may be up to 15\% lower than expected from the increase
  in time step due to the increase in viscosity and decrease in diffusion
  constant. In principle, introducing dummy atoms and increasing hydrogen mass
  do not influence thermodynamical properties of the system and dynamical
  properties are shown to be influenced only to a moderate degree. Comparing
  the maximum time step attainable with these methods (7 fs) to the time step
  of 2 fs that is routinely used in simulation, and taking into account the
  increase in viscosity and decrease in diffusion constant, we can say that a
  net gain in simulation efficiency of a factor of 3 to 3.5 can be achieved.

    \field{abstract}{%
    In this article, we present a new LINear Constraint Solver (LINCS) for
  molecular simulations with bond constraints. The algorithm is inherently
  stable, as the constraints themselves are reset instead of derivatives of the
  constraints, thereby eliminating drift. Although the derivation of the
  algorithm is presented in terms of matrices, no matrix matrix multiplications
  are needed and only the nonzero matrix elements have to be stored, making the
  method useful for very large molecules. At the same accuracy, the LINCS
  algorithm is three to four times faster than the SHAKE algorithm.
  Parallelization of the algorithm is straightforward. \textcopyright{} 1997

    \field{abstract}{%
    The time step of atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations is
  determined by the fastest motions in the system and is typically limited to 2
  fs. An increasingly popular solution is to increase the mass of the hydrogen
  atoms to \textasciitilde 3 amu and decrease the mass of the parent atom by an
  equivalent amount. This approach, known as hydrogen-mass repartitioning
  (HMR), permits time steps up to 4 fs with reasonable simulation stability.
  While HMR has been applied in many published studies to date, it has not been
  extensively tested for membrane-containing systems. Here, we compare the
  results of simulations of a variety of membranes and membrane-protein systems
  run using a 2-fs time step and a 4-fs time step with HMR. For pure membrane
  systems, we find almost no difference in structural properties, such as
  area-per-lipid, electron density profiles, and order parameters, although
  there are differences in kinetic properties such as the diffusion constant.
  Conductance through a porin in an applied field, partitioning of a small
  peptide, hydrogen-bond dynamics, and membrane mixing show very little
  dependence on HMR and the time step. We also tested a 9-\AA{} cutoff compared
  to the standard CHARMM cutoff of 12 \AA, finding significant deviations in
  many properties tested. We conclude that HMR is a valid approach for membrane
  systems but a 9-\AA{} cutoff is not.,%

    Membrane ion channels are the fundamental electrical components in the
  nervous system. Recent developments in X-ray crystallography and cryo-EM
  microscopy have revealed what these proteins look like in atomic detail but
  do not tell us how they function. Molecular dynamics simulations have
  progressed to the point that we can now simulate realistic molecular
  assemblies to produce quantitative calculations of the thermodynamic and
  kinetic quantities that control function. In this review, we summarize the
  state of atomistic simulation methods for ion channels to understand their
  conduction, activation, and drug modulation mechanisms. We are at a
  crossroads in atomistic simulation, where long time scale observation can
  provide unbiased exploration of mechanisms, supplemented by biased free
  energy methodologies. We illustrate the use of these approaches to describe
  ion conduction and selectivity in voltage-gated sodium and acid-sensing ion
  channels. Studies of channel gating present a significant challenge, as
  activation occurs on longer time scales. Enhanced sampling approaches can
  ensure convergence on minimum free energy pathways for activation, as
  illustrated here for pentameric ligand-gated ion channels that are principal
  to nervous system function and the actions of general anesthetics. We also
  examine recent studies of local anesthetic and antiepileptic drug binding to
  a sodium channel, revealing sites and pathways that may offer new targets for
  drug development. Modern simulations thus offer a range of molecular-level
  insights into ion channel function and modulation as a learning platform for
  mechanistic discovery and drug development.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    Spontaneous transitions between the native and non-native protein
  conformations are normally rare events that hardly take place in typical
  unbiased molecular dynamics simulations. It was recently demonstrated that
  such transitions can be well described by a reaction coordinate, Q, that
  represents the collective fraction of the native contacts between the protein
  atoms. Here we attempt to use this reaction coordinate to enhance the
  conformational sampling. We perform umbrella sampling simulations with
  biasing potentials on Q for two model proteins, Trp-Cage and BBA, using the
  CHARMM force field. Hamiltonian replica exchange is implemented in these
  simulations to further facilitate the sampling. The simulations appear to
  have reached satisfactory convergence, resulting in unbiased free energies as
  a function of Q. In addition to the native structure, multiple folded
  conformations are identified in the reconstructed equilibrium ensemble. Some
  conformations without any native contacts nonetheless have rather compact
  geometries and are stabilized by hydrogen bonds not present in the native
  structure. Whereas the enhanced sampling along Q reasonably reproduces the
  equilibrium conformational space, we also find that the folding of an
  {$\alpha$}-helix in Trp-Cage is a slow degree of freedom orthogonal to Q and
  therefore cannot be accelerated by biasing the reaction coordinate. Overall,
  we conclude that whereas Q is an excellent parameter to analyze the
  simulations, it is not necessarily a perfect reaction coordinate for enhanced
  sampling, and better incorporation of other slow degrees of freedom may
  further improve this reaction coordinate.%

    Potential of mean force (PMF) calculations are used to characterize the
  free energy landscape of protein\textendash lipid and protein\textendash
  protein association within membranes. Coarse-grained simulations allow
  binding free energies to be determined with reasonable statistical error.
  This accuracy relies on defining a good collective variable to describe the
  binding and unbinding transitions, and upon criteria for assessing the
  convergence of the simulation toward representative equilibrium sampling. As
  examples, we calculate protein\textendash lipid binding PMFs for
  ANT/cardiolipin and Kir2.2/PIP2, using umbrella sampling on a distance
  coordinate. These highlight the importance of replica exchange between
  windows for convergence. The use of two independent sets of simulations,
  initiated from bound and unbound states, provide strong evidence for
  simulation convergence. For a model protein\textendash protein interaction
  within a membrane, center-of-mass distance is shown to be a poor collective
  variable for describing transmembrane helix\textendash helix dimerization.
  Instead, we employ an alternative intermolecular distance matrix RMS (DRMS)
  coordinate to obtain converged PMFs for the association of the glycophorin
  transmembrane domain. While the coarse-grained force field gives a reasonable
  Kd for dimerization, the majority of the bound population is revealed to be
  in a near-native conformation. Thus, the combination of a refined reaction
  coordinate with improved sampling reveals previously unnoticed complexities
  of the dimerization free energy landscape. We propose the use of
  replica-exchange umbrella sampling starting from different initial conditions
  as a robust approach for calculation of the binding energies in membrane
  simulations.%

    GLIC is a bacterial member of the large family of pentameric ligand-gated
  ion channels. To study ion conduction through GLIC and other membrane
  channels, we combine the one-dimensional potential of mean force for ion
  passage with a Smoluchowski diffusion model, making it possible to calculate
  single-channel conductance in the regime of low ion concentrations from
  all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. We then perform MD simulations
  to examine sodium ion conduction through the GLIC transmembrane pore in two
  systems with different bulk ion concentrations. The ion potentials of mean
  force, calculated from umbrella sampling simulations with Hamiltonian replica
  exchange, reveal a major barrier at the hydrophobic constriction of the pore.
  The relevance of this barrier for ion transport is confirmed by a committor
  function that rises sharply in the barrier region. From the free evolution of
  Na(+) ions starting at the barrier top, we estimate the effective diffusion
  coefficient in the barrier region, and subsequently calculate the conductance
  of the pore. The resulting diffusivity compares well with the
  position-dependent ion diffusion coefficient obtained from restrained
  simulations. The ion conductance obtained from the diffusion model agrees
  with the value determined via a reactive-flux rate calculation. Our results
  show that the conformation in the GLIC crystal structure, with an estimated
  conductance of \textasciitilde 1 picosiemens at 140 mM ion concentration, is
  consistent with a physiologically open state of the channel.%

    The human multidrug transporter P-glycoprotein (P-gp) transports over 200
  chemically diverse substrates, influencing their bioavailability and tissue
  distribution. Pharmacological studies have identified both competitive and
  noncompetitive P-gp substrates, but neither the precise location of the
  substrate binding sites, nor the basis of competitive and noncompetitive
  interactions has been fully characterized. Here, potential of mean force
  (PMF) calculations are used to identify the transport-competent minimum free
  energy binding locations of five compounds, Hoechst 33342, Rhodamine 123,
  paclitaxel, tariquidar, and verapamil to P-gp. Unrestrained molecular
  dynamics simulations were also performed to confirm the substrates were
  stable in the energy wells determined using the PMF calculations. All
  compounds had energy minima within the P-gp transmembrane (TM) pore. For
  Hoechst 33342 and Rhodamine 123, a second minimum outside the TM pore was
  also identified. Based on this and previous studies of nicardipine and
  morphine [ Subramanian et al. J. Chem. Inf. Model. 2015, 55, 1202 ], a
  general scheme that accounts for the observed noncompetitive and competitive
  substrate interactions with P-gp is proposed.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    Changes in free energy provide valuable information for molecular
  recognition, including both ligand\textendash receptor binding thermodynamics
  and kinetics. Umbrella sampling (US), a widely used free energy calculation
  method, has long been used to explore the dissociation process of
  ligand\textendash receptor systems and compute binding free energy. In
  existing publications, the binding free energy computed from the potential of
  mean force (PMF) with US simulation mostly yielded ``ball park'' values with
  experimental data. However, the computed PMF values are highly influenced by
  factors such as initial conformations and/or trajectories provided, the
  reaction coordinate, and sampling of conformational space in each US window.
  These critical factors have rarely been carefully studied. Here we used US to
  study the guest aspirin and 1-butanol dissociation processes of
  {$\beta$}-cyclodextrin ({$\beta$}-CD) and an inhibitor SB2 dissociation from
  a p38{$\alpha$} mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) complex. For
  {$\beta$}-CD, we used three different {$\beta$}-CD conformations to generate
  the dissociation path with US windows. For p38{$\alpha$}, we generated the
  dissociation pathway by using accelerated molecular dynamics followed by
  conformational relaxing with short conventional MD, steered MD, and manual
  pulling. We found that, even for small {$\beta$}-CD complexes, different
  {$\beta$}-CD conformations altered the height of the PMF, but the pattern of
  PMF was not affected if the MD sampling in each US window was well-converged.
  Because changing the macrocyclic ring conformation needs to rotate dihedral
  angles in the ring, a bound ligand largely restrains the motion of
  cyclodextrin. Therefore, once a guest is in the binding site, cyclodextrin
  cannot freely change its initial conformation, resulting in different
  absolute heights of the PMF, which cannot be overcome by running excessively
  long MD simulations for each US window. Moreover, if the US simulations were
  not converged, the important barrier and minimum were missed. For
  ligand\textendash protein systems, our studies also suggest that the
  dissociation trajectories modeled by an enhanced sampling method must
  maintain a natural molecular movement to avoid biased PMF plots when using US
  simulations.%

    Free energy calculations for protein-ligand dissociation have been tested
  and validated for small ligands (50 atoms or less), but there has been a
  paucity of studies for larger, peptide-size ligands due to computational
  limitations. Previously we have studied the energetics of dissociation in a
  potassium channel-charybdotoxin complex by using umbrella sampling
  molecular-dynamics simulations, and established the need for carefully chosen
  coordinates and restraints to maintain the physiological ligand conformation.
  Here we address the ligand integrity problem further by constructing
  additional potential of mean forces for dissociation of charybdotoxin using
  restraints. We show that the large discrepancies in binding free energy
  arising from simulation artifacts can be avoided by using appropriate
  restraints on the ligand, which enables determination of the binding free
  energy within the chemical accuracy. We make several suggestions for optimal
  choices of harmonic potential parameters and restraints to be used in binding
  studies of large ligands. \textcopyright{} 2011 by the Biophysical Society.%

    The sluggish oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is a major impediment to the
  economic use of hydrogen fuel cells in transportation. In this work, we
  report the full ORR reaction mechanism for Pt(111) based on Quantum Mechanics
  (QM) based Reactive metadynamics (R{$\mu$}D) simulations including explicit
  water to obtain free energy reaction barriers at 298 K. The lowest energy
  pathway for 4 e- water formation is: first, *OOH formation; second, *OOH
  reduction to H2O and O*; third, O* hydrolysis using surface water to produce
  two *OH and finally *OH hydration to water. Water formation is the
  rate-determining step (RDS) for potentials above 0.87 Volt, the normal
  operating range. Considering the Eley\textendash Rideal (ER) mechanism
  involving protons from the solvent, we predict the free energy reaction
  barrier at 298 K for water formation to be 0.25 eV for an external potential
  below U = 0.87 V and 0.41 eV at U = 1.23 V, in good agreement with
  experimental values of 0.22 eV and 0.44 eV, respectively. With the mechanism

    Crystallization processes are characterized by activated events and long

    Metadynamics is an atomistic simulation technique that allows, within the
  same framework{$\mkern1mu$}, acceleration of rare events and estimation of
  the free energy of complex molecular systems. It is based on iteratively
  `filling' the potential energy of the system by a sum of Gaussians centred
  along the trajectory followed by a suitably chosen set of collective
  variables (CVs), thereby forcing the system to migrate from one minimum to
  the next. The power of metadynamics is demonstrated by the large number of
  extensions and variants that have been developed. The first scope of this
  Technical Review is to present a critical comparison of these variants,
  discussing their advantages and disadvantages. The effectiveness of
  metadynamics, and that of the numerous alternative methods, is strongly
  influenced by the choice of the CVs. If an important variable is neglected,
  the resulting estimate of the free energy is unreliable, and predicted
  transition mechanisms may be qualitatively wrong. The second scope of this
  Technical Review is to discuss how the CVs should be selected, how to verify
  whether the chosen CVs are sufficient or redundant, and how to iteratively
  improve the CVs using machine learning approaches.%

    Metadynamics is an important enhanced sampling technique in molecular
  dynamics simulation to efficiently explore potential energy surfaces. The
  recently developed transition-tempered metadynamics (TTMetaD) has been proven
  to converge asymptotically without sacrificing exploration of the collective
  variable space in the early stages of simulations, unlike other convergent
  metadynamics (MetaD) methods. We have applied TTMetaD to study the permeation
  of drug-like molecules through a lipid bilayer to further investigate the
  usefulness of this method as applied to problems of relevance to medicinal
  chemistry. First, ethanol permeation through a lipid bilayer was studied to
  compare TTMetaD with nontempered metadynamics and well-tempered metadynamics.
  The bias energies computed from various metadynamics simulations were
  compared to the potential of mean force calculated from umbrella sampling.
  Though all of the MetaD simulations agree with one another asymptotically,
  TTMetaD is able to predict the most accurate and reliable estimate of the
  potential of mean force for permeation in the early stages of the simulations
  and is robust to the choice of required additional parameters. We also show
  that using multiple randomly initialized replicas allows convergence analysis
  and also provides an efficient means to converge the simulations in shorter
  wall times and, more unexpectedly, in shorter CPU times; splitting the CPU
  time between multiple replicas appears to lead to less overall error. After
  validating the method, we studied the permeation of a more complicated
  drug-like molecule, trimethoprim. Three sets of TTMetaD simulations with
  different choices of collective variables were carried out, and all converged
  within feasible simulation time. The minimum free energy paths showed that
  TTMetaD was able to predict almost identical permeation mechanisms in each
  case despite significantly different definitions of collective variables.%

    Metadynamics is a commonly used and successful enhanced sampling method. By
  the introduction of a history dependent bias which depends on a restricted
  number of collective variables it can explore complex free energy surfaces
  characterized by several metastable states separated by large free energy
  barriers. Here we extend its scope by introducing a simple yet powerful
  method for calculating the rates of transition between different metastable
  states. The method does not rely on a previous knowledge of the transition
  states or reaction coordinates, as long as collective variables are known
  that can distinguish between the various stable minima in free energy space.
  We demonstrate that our method recovers the correct escape rates out of these
  stable states and also preserves the correct sequence of state-to-state
  transitions, with minimal extra computational effort needed over ordinary
  metadynamics. We apply the formalism to three different problems and in each
  case find excellent agreement with the results of long unbiased molecular
  dynamics runs.%

    Sampling a molecular process characterized by an activation free energy
  significantly larger than kBT is a well-known challenge in molecular dynamics
  simulations. In a recent work [Tiwary and Parrinello, Phys. Rev. Lett. 2013,
  111, 230602], we have demonstrated that the transition times of activated
  molecular transformations can be computed from well-tempered metadynamics
  provided that no bias is deposited in the transition state region and that
  the set of collective variables chosen to enhance sampling does not display
  hysteresis. Ensuring though that these two criteria are met may not always be
  simple. Here we build on the fact that the times of escape from a long-lived
  metastable state obey Poisson statistics. This allows us to identify
  quantitative measures of trustworthiness of our calculation. We test our
  method on a few paradigmatic examples. \textcopyright{} 2014 American

    Recently, we have introduced a new method, metadynamics, which is able to
  sample rarely occurring transitions and to reconstruct the free energy as a
  function of several variables with a controlled accuracy. This method has
  been successfully applied in many different fields, ranging from chemistry to
  biophysics and ligand docking and from material science to crystal structure
  prediction. We present an important development that speeds up metadynamics
  calculations by orders of magnitude and renders the algorithm much more
  robust. We use multiple interacting simulations, walkers, for exploring and
  reconstructing the same free energy surface. Each walker contributes to the
  history-dependent potential that, in metadynamics, is an estimate of the free
  energy. We show that the error on the reconstructed free energy does not
  depend on the number of walkers, leading to a fully linear scaling algorithm
  even on inexpensive loosely coupled clusters of PCs. In addition, we show
  that the accuracy and stability of the method are much improved by combining
  it with a weighted histogram analysis. We check the validity of our new
  method on a realistic application.%

    Despite the progress in modeling complex molecular systems of
  ever-increasing complexity, a quantitatively accurate computational treatment
  of ion permeation through narrow membrane channels remains challenging. An

  force field based on the classical Drude oscillators to assess the role of
  induced polarization effects on the energetics of sodium and potassium ion
  transport across the gramicidin A (gA) ion channel. The inclusion of induced
  polarization lowers barriers present in 1D potential of mean force (PMF) for
  cation permeation by {$\sim$}50\% compared to those obtained with the
  additive force field. Conductance properties calculated with 1D PMFs from
  Drude simulations are in better agreement with experimental results.
  Polarization of single-file water molecules and protein atoms forming the
  narrow pore has a direct impact on the free-energy barriers and
  cation-specific solid-state NMR chemical shifts. Sensitivity analysis
  indicates that small changes to water\textendash channel interactions can
  alter the free energy barrier for ion permeation. These results, illustrating
  polarization effects present in the complex electrostatic environment of the
  gA channel, have broad implications for revising proposed mechanisms of ion
  permeation and selectivity in a variety of ion channels.%

    We develop force field parameters for the divalent cations Mg2+, Ca2+,
  Sr2+, and Ba2+ for molecular dynamics simulations with the simple point
  charge-extended (SPC/E) water model. We follow an approach introduced
  recently for the optimization of monovalent ions, based on the simultaneous
  optimization of single-ion and ion-pair properties. We consider the solvation
  free energy of the divalent cations as the relevant single-ion property. As a
  probe for ion-pair properties we compute the activity derivatives of the salt
  solutions. The optimization of the ionic force fields is done in two
  consecutive steps. First, the cation solvation free energy is determined as a
  function of the Lennard-Jones (LJ) parameters. The peak in the ion-water
  radial distribution function (RDF) is used as a check of the structural
  properties of the ions. Second, the activity derivatives of the electrolytes
  MgY2, CaY2, BaY2, SrY2 are determined through Kirkwood-Buff solution theory,
  where Y = Cl-, Br-, I-. The activity derivatives are determined for the
  restricted set of LJ parameters which reproduce the exact solvation free
  energy of the divalent cations. The optimal ion parameters are those that
  match the experimental activity data and therefore simultaneously reproduce
  single-ion and ion-pair thermodynamic properties. For Ca2+, Ba2+, and Sr2+
  such LJ parameters exist. On the other hand, for Mg2+ the experimental
  activity derivatives can only be reproduced if we generalize the combination
  rule for the anion-cation LJ interaction and rescale the effective
  cation-anion LJ radius, which is a modification that leaves the cation
  solvation free energy invariant. The divalent cation force fields are
  transferable within acceptable accuracy, meaning the same cation force field
  is valid for all halide ions Cl-, Br-, I- tested in this study.%

    We compare the performance of five magnesium (Mg2+) ion models in
  simulations of an RNA stem loop which has an experimentally determined
  divalent ion dependent conformational shift. We show that despite their
  differences in parametrization and resulting van der Waals terms, including
  differences in the functional form of the nonbonded potential, when the RNA
  adopts its folded conformation, all models behave similarly across ten
  independent microsecond length simulations with each ion model. However, when
  the entire structure ensemble is accounted for, chelation of Mg2+ to RNA is
  seen in three of the five models, most egregiously and likely artifactual in
  simulations using a 12-6-4 model for the Lennard-Jones potential. Despite the
  simple nature of the fixed point-charge and van der Waals sphere models
  employed, and with the exception of the likely oversampled directed chelation
  of the 12-6-4 potential models, RNA\textendash Mg2+ interactions via first
  shell water molecules are surprisingly well described by modern parameters,
  allowing us to observe the spontaneous conformational shift from Mg2+ free
  RNA to Mg2+ associated RNA structure in unrestrained molecular dynamics

    The impact of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations in molecular biology and

  capture the behavior of proteins and other biomolecules in full atomic detail

  accuracy, and accessibility, together with the proliferation of experimental

  deciphering functional mechanisms of proteins and other biomolecules, in
  uncovering the structural basis for disease, and in the design and

    The CHARMM Drude-2013 polarizable force field (FF) was developed to include
  the explicit treatment of induced electronic polarizability, resulting in a
  more accurate description of the electrostatic interactions in molecular
  dynamics (MD) simulations. While the Drude-2013 protein FF has shown success
  in improving the folding properties of {$\alpha$}-helical peptides and to
  reproduce experimental observables in simulations up to 1 {$\mu$}s, some
  limitations were noted regarding the stability of {$\beta$}-sheet structures
  in simulations longer than 100 ns as well as larger deviations from crystal
  structures in simulations of a number of proteins compared to the additive
  CHARMM36 protein FF. The origin of the instability has been identified and
  appears to be primarily due to overestimated atomic polarizabilities and
  induced dipole-dipole interactions on the C{$\beta$}, C{$\gamma$} and
  C{$\delta$} side chain atoms. To resolve this and other issues, a number of
  aspects of the model were re-visited, resulting in Drude-2019 protein FF.
  Backbone parameters were optimized targeting the conformational properties of
  the (Ala)5 peptide in solution along with gas phase properties of the alanine
  dipeptide. Dipeptides that contain N-acetylated and N'-methylamidated
  termini, excluding Gly, Pro and Ala, were used as models to optimize the
  atomic polarizabilities and Thole screening factors on selected C{$\beta$},
  C{$\gamma$} and C{$\delta$} carbons by targeting quantum mechanical (QM)
  dipole moments and molecular polarizabilities. In addition, to obtain better
  conformational properties, side chain {$\chi$}1 and {$\chi$}2 dihedral
  parameters were optimized targeting QM data for the respective side chain
  dipeptide conformations as well as PDB survey data based on the {$\chi$}1,
  {$\chi$}2 sampling from Hamiltonian replica-exchange MD simulations of
  (Ala)4-X-(Ala)4 in solution, where X is the amino acid of interest. Further
  improvements include optimizing nonbonded interactions between charged
  residues to reproduce QM interactions energies of the charged-protein model
  compounds and experimental osmotic pressures. Validation of the optimized
  Drude protein FF includes MD simulations of a collection of peptides and
  proteins including {$\beta$}-sheet structures, as well as transmembrane ion
  channels. Results showed that the updated Drude-2019 protein FF yields
  smaller overall RMS differences of proteins as compared to the additive
  CHARMM36m and Drude-2013 FFs as well as similar or improved agreement with
  experimental NMR properties, allowing for long timescale simulation studies
  of proteins and more complex biomolecular systems in conjunction with the
  remainder of the Drude polarizable FF.,%

  effects in various chemical and physical environments. The atomic multipole
  electrostatic parameters for each amino acid residue type are derived from
  high-level gas phase quantum mechanical calculations via a consistent and
  extensible protocol. Molecular polarizability is modeled via a Thole-style
  damped interactive induction model based upon distributed atomic
  polarizabilities. Inter- and intramolecular polarization is treated in a
  consistent fashion via the Thole model. The intramolecular polarization model
  ensures transferability of electrostatic parameters among different
  conformations, as demonstrated by the agreement between QM and AMOEBA
  electrostatic potentials, and dipole moments of dipeptides. The backbone and
  side chain torsional parameters were determined by comparing to gas-phase QM
  (RI-TRIM MP2/CBS) conformational energies of dipeptides and to statistical
  distributions from the Protein Data Bank. Molecular dynamics simulations are
  reported for short peptides in explicit water to examine their conformational
  properties in solution. Overall the calculated conformational free energies
  and J-coupling constants are consistent with PDB statistics and experimental
  NMR results, respectively. In addition, the experimental crystal structures
  of a number of proteins are well maintained during molecular dynamics (MD)
  simulation. While further calculations are necessary to fully validate the
  force field, initial results suggest the AMOEBA polarizable multipole force
  field is able to describe the structure and energetics of peptides and
  proteins, in both gas-phase and solution environments.%

    Additive force fields are designed to account for induced electronic
  polarization in a mean-field average way, using effective empirical fixed
  charges. The limitation of this approximation is cause for serious concerns,
  particularly in the case of lipid membranes, where the molecular environment
  undergoes dramatic variations over microscopic length scales. A polarizable
  force field based on the classical Drude oscillator offers a practical and
  computationally efficient framework for an improved representation of
  electrostatic interactions in molecular simulations. Building on the
  first-generation Drude polarizable force field for the
  dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine
  (DPPC) molecule, the present effort was undertaken to improve this initial
  model and expand the force field to a wider range of phospholipid molecules.
  New lipids parametrized include dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC),
  dilauroylphosphatidylcholine (DLPC),
  1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC),
  1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC),
  dipalmitoylphosphatidylethanolamine (DPPE),
  1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (POPE), and
  1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DOPE). The iterative
  optimization protocol employed in this effort led to lipid models that
  achieve a good balance between reproducing quantum mechanical data on model
  compound representative of phospholipids and reproducing a range of
  experimental condensed phase properties of bilayers. A parametrization
  strategy based on a restrained ensemble\textendash maximum entropy
  methodology was used to help accurately match the experimental NMR order
  parameters in the polar headgroup region. All the parameters were developed
  to be compatible with the remainder of the Drude polarizable force field,
  which includes water, ions, proteins, DNA, and selected carbohydrates.%

    Human ubiquitin has been extensively characterized using a variety of
  experimental and computational methods and has become an important model for
  studying protein dynamics. Nevertheless, it has proven difficult to
  characterize the microsecond time scale dynamics of this protein with
  atomistic resolution. Here we use an unbiased computer simulation to describe
  the structural dynamics of ubiquitin on the picosecond to millisecond time
  scale. In the simulation, ubiquitin interconverts between a small number of
  distinct states on the microsecond to millisecond time scale. We find that
  the conformations visited by free ubiquitin in solution are very similar to
  those found various crystal structures of ubiquitin in complex with other
  proteins, a finding in line with previous experimental studies. We also
  observe weak but statistically significant correlated motions throughout the
  protein, including long-range concerted movement across the entire {$\beta$}
  sheet, consistent with recent experimental observations. We expect that the
  detailed atomistic description of ubiquitin dynamics provided by this
  unbiased simulation may be useful in interpreting current and future
  experiments on this protein.%

    Time-lagged independent component analysis (tICA) is a widely used
  dimension reduction method for the analysis of molecular dynamics (MD)
  trajectories and has proven particularly useful for the construction of
  protein dynamics Markov models. It identifies those ``slow'' collective
  degrees of freedom onto which the projections of a given trajectory show
  maximal autocorrelation for a given lag time. Here we ask how much
  information on the actual protein dynamics and, in particular, the free
  energy landscape that governs these dynamics the tICA-projections of
  MD-trajectories contain, as opposed to noise due to the inherently stochastic
  nature of each trajectory. To answer this question, we have analyzed the
  tICA-projections of high dimensional random walks using a combination of
  analytical and numerical methods. We find that the projections resemble
  cosine functions and strongly depend on the lag time, exhibiting strikingly
  complex behavior. In particular, and contrary to previous studies of
  principal component projections, the projections change noncontinuously with
  increasing lag time. The tICA-projections of selected 1 {$\mu$}s protein
  trajectories and those of random walks are strikingly similar, particularly
  for larger proteins, suggesting that these trajectories contain only little
  information on the energy landscape that governs the actual protein dynamics.
  Further the tICA-projections of random walks show clusters very similar to
  those observed for the protein trajectories, suggesting that clusters in the
  tICA-projections of protein trajectories do not necessarily reflect local
  minima in the free energy landscape. We also conclude that, in addition to
  the previous finding that certain ensemble properties of nonconverged protein
  trajectories resemble those of random walks; this is also true for their time
  correlations.%

    Here we propose the reweighted autoencoded variational Bayes for enhanced
  sampling (RAVE) method, a new iterative scheme that uses the deep learning
  framework of variational autoencoders to enhance sampling in molecular
  simulations. RAVE involves iterations between molecular simulations and deep
  learning in order to produce an increasingly accurate probability
  distribution along a low-dimensional latent space that captures the key
  features of the molecular simulation trajectory. Using the Kullback-Leibler
  divergence between this latent space distribution and the distribution of
  various trial reaction coordinates sampled from the molecular simulation,
  RAVE determines an optimum, yet nonetheless physically interpretable,
  reaction coordinate and optimum probability distribution. Both then directly
  serve as the biasing protocol for a new biased simulation, which is once
  again fed into the deep learning module with appropriate weights accounting
  for the bias, the procedure continuing until estimates of desirable
  thermodynamic observables are converged. Unlike recent methods using deep
  learning for enhanced sampling purposes, RAVE stands out in that (a) it
  naturally produces a physically interpretable reaction coordinate, (b) is
  independent of existing enhanced sampling protocols to enhance the
  fluctuations along the latent space identified via deep learning, and (c) it
  provides the ability to easily filter out spurious solutions learned by the
  deep learning procedure. The usefulness and reliability of RAVE is
  demonstrated by applying it to model potentials of increasing complexity,
  including computation of the binding free energy profile for a hydrophobic
  ligand\textendash substrate system in explicit water with dissociation time
  of more than 3 min, in computer time at least twenty times less than that
  needed for umbrella sampling or metadynamics.%

    VMD is a molecular graphics program designed for the display and analysis
  of molecular assemblies, in particular biopolymers such as proteins and
  nucleic acids. VMD can simultaneously display any number of structures using
  a wide variety of rendering styles and coloring methods. Molecules are
  displayed as one or more 'representations,' in which each representation
  embodies a particular rendering method and coloring scheme for a selected
  subset of atoms. The atoms displayed in each representation are chosen using
  an extensive atom selection syntax, which includes Boolean operators and
  regular expressions. VMD provides a complete graphical user interface for
  program control, as well as a text interface using the Tcl embeddable parser
  to allow for complex scripts with variable substitution, control loops, and
  function calls. Full session logging is supported, which produces a VMD
  command script for later playback. High-resolution raster images of displayed
  molecules may be produced by generating input scripts for use by a number of
  photorealistic image-rendering applications. VMD has also been expressly
  designed with the ability to animate molecular dynamics (MD) simulation
  trajectories, imported either from files or from a direct connection to a
  running MD simulation. VMD is the visualization component of MDScope, a set
  of tools for interactive problem solving in structural biology, which also
  includes the parallel MD program NAMD, and the MDCOMM software used to
  connect the visualization and simulation programs. VMD is written in C++,
  using an object-oriented design; the program, including source code and
  extensive documentation, is freely available via anonymous ftp and through
  the World Wide Web.%

    Molecular dynamics simulations are an effective tool to study the
  structure, dynamics, and thermodynamics of carbohydrates and proteins.
  However, the simulations of heterogeneous glycoprotein systems have been
  limited due to the lack of appropriate molecular force field parameters
  describing the linkage between the carbohydrate and the protein regions as
  well as the tools to prepare these systems for modeling studies. In this work
  we outline the recent developments in the CHARMM carbohydrate force field to
  treat glycoproteins and describe in detail the step-by-step procedures
  involved in building glycoprotein geometries using CHARMM-GUI Glycan Reader.%

    MDAnalysis is an object-oriented library for structural and temporal
  analysis of molecular dynamics (MD) simulation trajectories and individual
  protein structures. It is written in the Python language with some
  performance-critical code in C. It uses the powerful NumPy package to expose
  trajectory data as fast and efficient NumPy arrays. It has been tested on
  systems of millions of particles. Many common file formats of simulation
  packages including CHARMM, Gromacs, Amber, and NAMD and the Protein Data Bank
  format can be read and written. Atoms can be selected with a syntax similar
  to CHARMM's powerful selection commands. MDAnalysis enables both novice and
  experienced programmers to rapidly write their own analytical tools and
  access data stored in trajectories in an easily accessible manner that
  facilitates interactive explorative analysis. MDAnalysis has been tested on
  and works for most Unix-based platforms such as Linux and Mac OS X. It is

    \field{abstract}{%
    Protein structures in the Protein Data Bank provide a wealth of data about
  the interactions that determine the native states of proteins. Using the
  probability theory, we derive an atomic distance-dependent statistical
  potential from a sample of native structures that does not depend on any
  adjustable parameters (Discrete Optimized Protein Energy, or DOPE). DOPE is
  based on an improved reference state that corresponds to noninteracting atoms
  in a homogeneous sphere with the radius dependent on a sample native
  structure; it thus accounts for the finite and spherical shape of the native
  structures. The DOPE potential was extracted from a nonredundant set of 1472
  crystallographic structures. We tested DOPE and five other scoring functions
  by the detection of the native state among six multiple target decoy sets,
  the correlation between the score and model error, and the identification of
  the most accurate non-native structure in the decoy set. For all decoy sets,
  DOPE is the best performing function in terms of all criteria, except for a
  tie in one criterion for one decoy set. To facilitate its use in various
  applications, such as model assessment, loop modeling, and fitting into
  cryo-electron microscopy mass density maps combined with comparative protein
  structure modeling, DOPE was incorporated into the modeling package
  MODELLER-8.%

    OpenMM is a molecular dynamics simulation toolkit with a unique focus on
  extensibility. It allows users to easily add new features, including forces
  with novel functional forms, new integration algorithms, and new simulation
  protocols. Those features automatically work on all supported hardware types
  (including both CPUs and GPUs) and perform well on all of them. In many cases
  they require minimal coding, just a mathematical description of the desired
  function. They also require no modification to OpenMM itself and can be
  distributed independently of OpenMM. This makes it an ideal tool for
  researchers developing new simulation methods, and also allows those new
  methods to be immediately available to the larger community.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    Enhancing sampling and analyzing simulations are central issues in
  molecular simulation. Recently, we introduced PLUMED, an open-source plug-in
  that provides some of the most popular molecular dynamics (MD) codes with
  implementations of a variety of different enhanced sampling algorithms and
  collective variables (CVs). The rapid changes in this field, in particular
  new directions in enhanced sampling and dimensionality reduction together
  with new hardware, require a code that is more flexible and more efficient.
  We therefore present PLUMED 2 here - a complete rewrite of the code in an
  object-oriented programming language (C++). This new version introduces
  greater flexibility and greater modularity, which both extends its core
  capabilities and makes it far easier to add new methods and CVs. It also has
  a simpler interface with the MD engines and provides a single software
  library containing both tools and core facilities. Ultimately, the new code
  better serves the ever-growing community of users and contributors in coping
  with the new challenges arising in the field. \textcopyright{} 2013 Elsevier

    Abstract The aim of the UniProt Knowledgebase is to provide users with a
  comprehensive, high-quality and freely accessible set of protein sequences
  annotated with functional information. In this article, we describe
  significant updates that we have made over the last two years to the
  resource. The number of sequences in UniProtKB has risen to approximately 190
  million, despite continued work to reduce sequence redundancy at the proteome
  level. We have adopted new methods of assessing proteome completeness and
  quality. We continue to extract detailed annotations from the literature to
  add to reviewed entries and supplement these in unreviewed entries with
  annotations provided by automated systems such as the newly implemented
  Association-Rule-Based Annotator (ARBA). We have developed a credit-based
  publication submission interface to allow the community to contribute
  publications and annotations to UniProt entries. We describe how UniProtKB
  responded to the COVID-19 pandemic through expert curation of relevant
  entries that were rapidly made available to the research community through a
  dedicated portal. UniProt resources are available under a CC-BY (4.0) license
  via the web at https://www.uniprot.org/.%

    The chapter focuses on a general description of the force fields that are
  most commonly used at present, and it gives an indication of the directions
  of current research that may yield better functions in the near future. After
  a brief survey of current models, mostly generated during the 1990s, the
  focus of the chapter is on the general directions the field is taking in
  developing new models. The most commonly used protein force fields
  incorporate a relatively simple potential energy function: The emphasis is on
  the use of continuum methods to model the electrostatic effects of hydration
  and the introduction of polarizability to model the electronic response to
  changes in the environment. Some of the history and performance of widely
  used protein force fields based on an equation on simplest potential energy
  function or closely related equations are reviewed. The chapter outlines some
  promising developments that go beyond this, primarily by altering the way
  electrostatic interactions are treated. The use of atomic multipoles and
  off-center charge distributions, as well as attempts to incorporate
  electronic polarizability, are also discussed in the chapter.%

    We describe our efforts to prepare common starting structures and models
  for the SAMPL5 blind prediction challenge. We generated the starting input
  files and single configuration potential energies for the host-guest in the
  SAMPL5 blind prediction challenge for the GROMACS, AMBER, LAMMPS, DESMOND and
  CHARMM molecular simulation programs. All conversions were fully automated
  from the originally prepared AMBER input files using a combination of the
  ParmEd and InterMol conversion programs. We find that the energy calculations
  for all molecular dynamics engines for this molecular set agree to better
  than 0.1~\% relative absolute energy for all energy components, and in most
  cases an order of magnitude better, when reasonable choices are made for
  different cutoff parameters. However, there are some surprising sources of
  statistically significant differences. Most importantly, different choices of
  Coulomb's constant between programs are one of the largest sources of
  discrepancies in energies. We discuss the measures required to get good
  agreement in the energies for equivalent starting configurations between the
  simulation programs, and the energy differences that occur when simulations
  are run with program-specific default simulation parameter values. Finally,
  we discuss what was required to automate this conversion and comparison.%

    Cystic fibrosis (CF) lung disease reflects the failure of airways defense
  against chronic bacterial infection. Studies of CF cultures, transgenic mice,
  and CF patients suggest that the initiating event in CF airways disease
  pathogenesis is reduced airway surface liquid (ASL) volume, i.e.,
  dehydration. CF ASL volume regulation depends on a single extracellular
  signaling system, ATP, which renders CF airways more vulnerable to
  disease-causing insults (e.g., viruses) than are normal airways, which
  regulate ASL volume by dual ATP and adenosine signaling pathways. Clinical
  studies have explored the hypothesis that treating the dehydration of CF
  airways will be therapeutically beneficial. Inhaled hypertonic saline
  osmotically draws water onto airway surfaces, improves mucus clearance and
  pulmonary function, and reduces acute exacerbations in CF patients. Thus,
  rehydration therapies may slow the progression of CF lung disease in patients
  with established bacterial infection and may prevent the onset of CF lung
  disease if initiated early in life. Copyright \textcopyright{} 2007 by Annual

    Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common autosomal recessive disorder in
  Caucasian populations. Individuals with CF have seen significant increases in
  life expectancy in the last 60 years. As a result, previously rare
  complications are now coming to light. The most common of these is cystic
  fibrosis-related diabetes (CFRD), which affects 40-50\% of CF adults. CFRD
  significantly impacts the pulmonary function and longevity of CF patients,
  yet a lack of consensus on the best methods to diagnose and treat CFRD
  remains. We begin by reviewing our understanding of the pathogenesis of CFRD,
  as emerging evidence shows the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance
  regulator (CFTR) also has important roles in the release of insulin and
  glucagon and in the protection of {$\beta$} cells from oxidative stress. We
  then discuss how current recommended methods of CFRD diagnosis are not
  appropriate, as continuous glucose monitoring becomes more effective,
  practical, and cost-effective. Finally, we evaluate emerging treatments which
  have narrowed the mortality gap within the CF patient group. In the future,
  pharmacological potentiators and correctors directly targeting CFTR show huge
  promise for both CFRD and the wider CF patient groups.%

    Cystic fibrosis is the most common life-limiting recessive genetic disorder
  in Caucasian populations, characterized by the involvement of exocrine
  glands, causing multisystemic comorbidities. Since the first descriptions of
  pancreatic and pulmonary involvement in children, technological development
  and basic science research have allowed great advances in the diagnosis and
  treatment of cystic fibrosis. The great search for treatments that acted at
  the genetic level, despite not having found a cure for this disease,
  culminated in the creation of CFTR modulators, highly effective medications
  for certain groups of patients. However, there are still many obstacles

    \field{abstract}{%
    Soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptors
  (SNAREs) mediate membrane fusion reactions in eukaryotic cells by assembling
  into complexes that link vesicle-associated SNAREs with SNAREs on target
  membranes (t-SNAREs). Many SNARE complexes contain two t-SNAREs that form a
  heterodimer, a putative intermediate in SNARE assembly. Individual t-SNAREs
  (e.g., syntaxin 1A) also regulate synaptic calcium channels and cystic
  fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), the epithelial chloride
  channel that is defective in cystic fibrosis. Whether the regulation of ion
  channels by individual t-SNAREs is related to SNARE complex assembly and
  membrane fusion is unknown. Here we show that CFTR channels are coordinately
  regulated by two cognate t-SNAREs, SNAP-23 (synaptosome-associated protein of
  23 kDa) and syntaxin 1A. SNAP-23 physically associates with CFTR by binding
  to its amino-terminal tail, a region that modulates channel gating.
  CFTR-mediated chloride currents are inhibited by introducing excess SNAP-23
  into HT29-Cl.19A epithelial cells. Conversely, CFTR activity is stimulated by
  a SNAP-23 antibody that blocks the binding of this t-SNARE to the CFTR
  amino-terminal tail. The physical and functional interactions between SNAP-23
  and CFTR depend on syntaxin 1A, which binds to both proteins. We conclude
  that CFTR channels are regulated by a t-SNARE complex that may tune CFTR
  activity to rates of membrane traffic in epithelial cells.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    Previously we showed that the functional activity of the epithelial
  chloride channel that is encoded by the cystic fibrosis gene (CFTR) is
  reciprocally modulated by two components of the vesicle fusion machinery,
  syntaxin 1A and Munc-18. Here we report that syntaxin 1A inhibits CFTR
  chloride channels by means of direct and domain-specific protein-protein
  interactions. Syntaxin 1A stoichiometrically binds to the N-terminal
  cytoplasmic tail of CFTR, and this binding is blocked by Munc-18. The
  modulation of CFTR currents by syntaxin 1A is eliminated either by deletion
  of this tail or by injecting this tail as a blocking peptide into
  coexpressing Xenopus oocytes. The CFTR binding site on syntaxin 1A maps to
  the third predicted helical domain (H3) of this membrane protein. Moreover,
  CFTR Cl- currents are effectively inhibited by a minimal syntaxin 1A
  construct (i.e., the membrane-anchored H3 domain) that cannot fully
  substitute for wild-type syntaxin 1A in membrane fusion reactions. We also
  show that syntaxin 1A binds to and inhibits the activities of disease-
  associated mutants of CFTR, and that the chloride current activity of
  recombinant {$\Delta$}F508 CFTR (i.e., the most common cystic fibrosis
  mutant) can be potentiated by disrupting its interaction with syntaxin 1A in
  cultured epithelial cells. Our results provide evidence for a direct physical
  interaction between CFTR and syntaxin 1A that limits the functional
  activities of normal and disease-associated forms of this chloride channel.%

    The role of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR)
  as a cAMP-dependent chloride channel on the apical membrane of epithelia is
  well established. However, the processes by which CFTR is regulated on the
  cell surface are not clear. Here we report the identification of a
  protein-protein interaction between CFTR and the cytoskeletal filamin
  proteins. Using proteomic approaches, we identified filamins as proteins that
  associate with the extreme CFTR N terminus. Furthermore, we identified a
  disease-causing missense mutation in CFTR, serine 13 to phenylalanine (S13F),
  which disrupted this interaction. In cells, filamins tethered plasma membrane
  CFTR to the underlying actin network. This interaction stabilized CFTR at the
  cell surface and regulated the plasma membrane dynamics and confinement of
  the channel. In the absence of filamin binding, CFTR was internalized from
  the cell surface, where it prematurely accumulated in lysosomes and was
  ultimately degraded. Our data demonstrate what we believe to be a previously
  unrecognized role for the CFTR N terminus in the regulation of the plasma
  membrane stability and metabolic stability of CFTR. In addition, we elucidate
  the molecular defect associated with the S13F mutation.%

    Backgraoud \& Aims Aberrant epithelial bicarbonate (HCO3-) secretion caused
  by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator
  (CFTR) gene is associated with several diseases including cystic fibrosis and
  pancreatitis. Dynamically regulated ion channel activity and anion
  selectivity of CFTR by kinases sensitive to intracellular chloride
  concentration ([Cl-]i) play an important role in epithelial HCO3- secretion.
  However, the molecular mechanisms of how [Cl-]i-dependent mechanisms regulate
  CFTR are unknown. Methods We examined the mechanisms of the CFTR HCO3-
  channel regulation by [Cl-]i-sensitive kinases using an integrated
  electrophysiological, molecular, and computational approach including
  whole-cell, outside-out, and inside-out patch clamp recordings and molecular
  dissection of WNK1 and CFTR proteins. In addition, we analyzed the effects of
  pancreatitis-causing CFTR mutations on the WNK1-mediated regulation of CFTR.
  Results Among the WNK1, SPAK, and OSR1 kinases that constitute a
  [Cl-]i-sensitive kinase cascade, the expression of WNK1 alone was sufficient
  to increase the CFTR bicarbonate permeability (PHCO3/PCl) and conductance
  (GHCO3) in patch clamp recordings. Molecular dissection of the WNK1 domains
  revealed that the WNK1 kinase domain is responsible for CFTR PHCO3/PCl
  regulation by direct association with CFTR, while the surrounding N-terminal
  regions mediate the [Cl-]i-sensitivity of WNK1. Furthermore, the
  pancreatitis-causing R74Q and R75Q mutations in the elbow helix 1 of CFTR
  hampered WNK1-CFTR physical associations and reduced WNK1-mediated CFTR
  PHCO3/PCl regulation. Conclusion The CFTR HCO3- channel activity is regulated
  by [Cl-]i and a WNK1-dependent mechanism. Our results provide new insights
  into the regulation of the ion selectivity of CFTR and the pathogenesis of
  CFTR-related disorders.%

    The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) functions as
  a Cl- channel important in transepithelial salt and water transport. While
  there is a paucity of direct structural information on CFTR, much has been
  learned about the molecular determinants of the CFTR Cl- channel pore region
  and the mechanism of Cl- permeation through the pore from indirect
  structure\textendash function studies. The first and sixth transmembrane
  regions of the CFTR protein play major roles in forming the channel pore and
  determining its functional properties by interacting with permeating Cl-
  ions. Positively charged amino acid side-chains are involved in attracting
  negatively charged Cl- ions into the pore region, where they interact briefly
  with a number of discrete sites on the pore walls. The pore appears able to
  accommodate more than one Cl- ion at a time, and Cl- ions bound inside the
  pore are probably sensitive to one another's presence. Repulsive interactions
  between Cl- ions bound concurrently within the pore may be important in
  ensuring rapid movement of Cl- ions through the pore. Chloride ion binding
  sites also interact with larger anions that can occlude the pore and block
  Cl- permeation, thus inhibiting CFTR function. Other ions besides Cl- are
  capable of passing through the pore, and specific amino acid residues that
  may be important in allowing the channel to discriminate between different
  anions have been identified. This brief review summarizes these mechanistic
  insights and tries to incorporate them into a simple cartoon model depicting
  the interactions between the channel and Cl- ions that are important for ion
  translocation.%

    {$<$}p{$>$}Ion channels use charged amino-acid residues to attract
  oppositely charged permeant ions into the channel pore. In the cystic
  fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) Cl\textsuperscript{-}
  channel, a number of arginine and lysine residues have been shown to be
  important for Cl\textsuperscript{-} permeation. Among these, two in close
  proximity in the pore\textemdash Lys\textsuperscript{95} and
  Arg\textsuperscript{134}\textemdash are indispensable for anion binding and
  high Cl\textsuperscript{-} conductance, suggesting that high positive charge
  density is required for pore function. Here we used mutagenesis and
  functional characterization to show that a nearby pore-lining negatively
  charged residue (Glu\textsuperscript{92}) plays a functionally additive role
  with these two positive charges. While neutralization of this negative charge
  had little effect on anion binding or Cl\textsuperscript{-} conductance, such
  neutralization was able to reverse the detrimental effects of removing the
  positive charge at either Lys\textsuperscript{95} or
  Arg\textsuperscript{134}, as well as the similar effects of introducing a
  negative charge at a neighboring residue (Ser\textsuperscript{1141}).
  Furthermore, neutralization of Glu\textsuperscript{92} greatly increased the
  susceptibility of the channel to blockage by divalent
  S\textsubscript{2}O\textsubscript{3}\textsuperscript{2-} anions, mimicking
  the effect of introducing additional positive charge in this region; this
  effect was reversed by concurrent neutralization of either
  Lys\textsuperscript{95} or Arg\textsuperscript{134}. Across a panel of mutant
  channels that introduced or removed fixed charges at these four positions, we
  found that many pore properties are dependent on the overall charge or charge
  density. We propose that the CFTR pore uses a combination of positively and
  negatively charged residues to optimize the anion binding and
  Cl\textsuperscript{-} conductance properties of the channel.{$<$}/p{$>$}%

    The Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (CFTR) anion
  channel is essential for epithelial salt\textendash water balance. CFTR
  mutations cause cystic fibrosis, a lethal incurable disease. In cells CFTR is
  activated through the cAMP signaling pathway, overstimulation of which during
  cholera leads to CFTR-mediated intestinal salt\textendash water loss. Channel
  activation is achieved by phosphorylation of its regulatory (R) domain by
  cAMP-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (PKA). Here we show using two
  independent approaches\textendash\textendash an ATP analog that can drive
  CFTR channel gating but is unsuitable for phosphotransfer by PKA, and CFTR
  mutants lacking phosphorylatable serines\textendash\textendash that PKA
  efficiently opens CFTR channels through simple binding, under conditions that
  preclude phosphorylation. Unlike when phosphorylation happens, CFTR
  activation by PKA binding is completely reversible. Thus, PKA binding
  promotes release of the unphosphorylated R domain from its inhibitory
  position, causing full channel activation, whereas phosphorylation serves
  only to maintain channel activity beyond termination of the PKA signal. The
  results suggest two levels of CFTR regulation in cells: irreversible through
  phosphorylation, and reversible through R-domain binding to
  PKA\textendash\textendash and possibly also to other members of a large
  network of proteins known to interact with the channel.%

    Transmembrane (TM) proteins are major drug targets, but their structure
  determination, a prerequisite for rational drug design, remains challenging.
  Recently, the DeepMind's AlphaFold2 machine learning method greatly expanded
  the structural coverage of sequences with high accuracy. Since the employed
  algorithm did not take specific properties of TM proteins into account, the
  reliability of the generated TM structures should be assessed. Therefore, we
  quantitatively investigated the quality of structures at genome scales, at
  the level of ABC protein superfamily folds and for specific membrane proteins
  (e.g. dimer modeling and stability in molecular dynamics simulations). We
  tested template-free structure prediction with a challenging TM CASP14 target
  and several TM protein structures published after AlphaFold2 training. Our
  results suggest that AlphaFold2 performs well in the case of TM proteins and
  its neural network is not overfitted. We conclude that cautious applications
  of AlphaFold2 structural models will advance TM protein-associated studies at
  an unexpected level.%

    Cystic fibrosis is a fatal disease caused by mutations in the cystic
  fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). Two main categories of
  drugs are being developed: correctors that improve folding of CFTR and
  potentiators that recover the function of CFTR. Here, we report two
  cryo-electron microscopy structures of human CFTR in complex with
  potentiators: one with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved
  drug ivacaftor at 3.3-angstrom resolution and the other with an
  investigational drug, GLPG1837, at 3.2-angstrom resolution. These two drugs,
  although chemically dissimilar, bind to the same site within the
  transmembrane region. Mutagenesis suggests that in both cases, hydrogen bonds
  provided by the protein are important for drug recognition. The molecular
  details of how ivacaftor and GLPG1837 interact with CFTR may facilitate
  structure-based optimization of therapeutic compounds.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is an inherited disease caused by mutations in the
  cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) ion channel.
  Mutations in CFTR cause impaired chloride ion transport in the epithelial
  tissues of patients leading to cardiopulmonary decline and pancreatic
  insufficiency in the most severely affected patients. CFTR is composed of
  twelve membrane-spanning domains, two nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs), and
  a regulatory domain. The most common mutation in CFTR is a deletion of
  phenylalanine at position 508 ({$\delta$}F508) in NBD1. Previous research has
  primarily concentrated on the structure and dynamics of the NBD1 domain;
  However numerous pathological mutations have also been found in the
  lesser-studied NBD2 domain. We have investigated the amino acid coevolved
  network of interactions in NBD2, and the changes that occur in that network
  upon the introduction of CF and CF-related mutations (S1251N(T), S1235R,
  D1270N, N1303K (T)). Extensive coupling between the {$\alpha$}- and
  {$\beta$}-subdomains were identified with residues in, or near Walker A,
  Walker B, H-loop and C-loop motifs. Alterations in the predicted residue
  network varied from moderate for the S1251T perturbation to more severe for
  N1303T. The S1235R and D1270N networks varied greatly compared to the
  wildtype, but these CF mutations only affect ion transport preference and do
  not severely disrupt CFTR function, suggesting dynamic flexibility in the
  network of interactions in NBD2. Our results also suggest that inappropriate
  interactions between the {$\beta$}-subdomain and Q-loop could be detrimental.
  We also identified mutations predicted to stabilize the NBD2 residue network
  upon introduction of the CF and CF-related mutations, and these predicted
  mutations are scored as benign by the MUTPRED2 algorithm. Our results suggest
  the level of disruption of the coevolution predictions of the amino acid
  networks in NBD2 does not have a straightforward correlation with the
  severity of the CF phenotypes observed.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    For a primary active pump, such as the human ATP-binding-cassette (ABC)
  transporter ABCB1, coupling of drug-binding by the two transmembrane domains
  (TMDs) to the ATP catalytic cycle of the two nucleotide-binding domains
  (NBDs) is fundamental to the transport mechanism, but is poorly understood at
  the biochemical level. Structure data suggest that signals are transduced
  through intracellular loops of the TMDs that slot into grooves on the NBDs.
  At the base of these grooves is the Q loop. We therefore mutated the
  eponymous glutamine in one or both NBD Q loops and measured the effect on
  conformation and function by using a conformation-sensitive antibody (UIC2)
  and a fluorescent drug (Bodipy-verapamil), respectively. We showed that the
  double mutant is trapped in the inward-open state, which binds the drug, but
  cannot couple to the ATPase cycle. Our data also describe marked redundancy
  within the transport mechanism, because single-Q-loop mutants are functional
  for Bodipy-verapamil transport. This result allowed us to elucidate
  transduction pathways from twin drug-binding cavities to the Q loops using
  point mutations to favor one cavity over the other. Together, the data show
  that the Q loop is the central flexion point where the aspect of the
  drug-binding cavities is coupled to the ATP catalytic cycle.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    The ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter cystic fibrosis transmembrane
  conductance regulator (CFTR) and two other non-membrane-bound ABC proteins,
  Rad50 and a structural maintenance of chromosome (SMC) protein, exhibit
  adenylate kinase activity in the presence of physiologic concentrations of
  ATP and AMP or ADP (ATP + AMP {$\leftrightarrows$} 2 ADP). The crystal
  structure of the nucleotide-binding domain of an SMC protein in complex with
  the adenylate kinase bisubstrate inhibitor P(1),P(5)-di(adenosine-5')
  pentaphosphate (Ap5A) suggests that AMP binds to the conserved Q-loop
  glutamine during the adenylate kinase reaction. Therefore, we hypothesized
  that mutating the corresponding residue in CFTR, Gln-1291, selectively
  disrupts adenylate kinase-dependent channel gating at physiologic nucleotide
  concentrations. We found that substituting Gln-1291 with bulky side-chain
  amino acids abolished the effects of Ap5A, AMP, and adenosine
  5'-monophosphoramidate on CFTR channel function. 8-Azidoadenosine
  5'-monophosphate photolabeling of the AMP-binding site and adenylate kinase
  activity were disrupted in Q1291F CFTR. The Gln-1291 mutations did not alter
  the potency of ATP at stimulating current or ATP-dependent gating when ATP
  was the only nucleotide present. However, when physiologic concentrations of
  ADP and AMP were added, adenylate kinase-deficient Q1291F channels opened
  significantly less than wild type. Consistent with this result, we found that
  Q1291F CFTR displayed significantly reduced Cl(-) channel function in well
  differentiated primary human airway epithelia. These results indicate that a
  highly conserved residue of an ABC transporter plays an important role in
  adenylate kinase-dependent CFTR gating. Furthermore, the results suggest that
  adenylate kinase activity is important for normal CFTR channel function in
  airway epithelia.%

    Members of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter superfamily
  translocate a broad spectrum of chemically diverse substrates. While their
  eponymous ATP-binding cassette in the nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs) is
  highly conserved, their transmembrane domains (TMDs) forming the
  translocation pathway exhibit distinct folds and topologies, suggesting that
  during evolution the ancient motor domains were combined with different
  transmembrane mechanical systems to orchestrate a variety of cellular
  processes. In recent years, it has become increasingly evident that the
  distinct TMD folds are best suited to categorize the multitude of ABC
  transporters. We therefore propose a new ABC transporter classification that
  is based on structural homology in the TMDs.%

    Cystic fibrosis is caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane
  conductance regulator (CFTR). CFTR is a member of the ATP-binding cassette
  (ABC) family of membrane transport proteins, most members of which function
  as ATP-dependent pumps. CFTR is unique among human ABC proteins in
  functioning not as a pump, but as an ion channel. Recent structural data has
  indicated that CFTR shares broadly similar overall architecture and
  ATP-dependent conformational changes as other ABC proteins. Functional
  investigations suggest that CFTR has a unique open portal connecting the
  cytoplasm to the transmembrane channel pore, that allows for a continuous
  pathway for Cl- ions to cross the membrane in one conformation. This lateral
  portal may be what allows CFTR to function as an ion channel rather than as a
  pump, suggesting a plausible mechanism by which channel function may have
  evolved in CFTR.%

    Ion channels are essential for cellular signaling. Voltage-gated ion
  channels (VGICs) are the largest and most extensively studied superfamily of
  ion channels. They possess modular structural features such as
  voltage-sensing domains that encircle and form mechanical connections with
  the pore-forming domains. Such features are intimately related to their
  function in sensing and responding to changes in the membrane potential. In
  the present work, we discuss the thermodynamic mechanisms of the VGIC

  mechanism of the voltage sensor, subunit cooperation, lipid-infiltration
  mechanism of inactivation, and the relationship with their structural

    The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is an anion
  channel evolved from the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter family. In
  this study, we determined the structure of zebrafish CFTR in the absence of
  ATP by electron cryo-microscopy to 3.7 \AA{} resolution. Human and zebrafish
  CFTR share 55\% sequence identity, and 42 of the 46 cystic-fibrosis-causing
  missense mutational sites are identical. In CFTR, we observe a large anion
  conduction pathway lined by numerous positively charged residues. A single
  gate near the extracellular surface closes the channel. The regulatory
  domain, dephosphorylated, is located in the intracellular opening between the
  two nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs), preventing NBD dimerization and
  channel opening. The structure also reveals why many cystic-fibrosis-causing
  mutations would lead to defects either in folding, ion conduction, or gating
  and suggests new avenues for therapeutic intervention.%

    The regulatory (R) region of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance
  regulator (CFTR) is intrinsically disordered and must be phosphorylated at
  multiple sites for full CFTR channel activity, with no one specific
  phosphorylation site required. In addition, nucleotide binding and hydrolysis
  at the nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs) of CFTR are required for channel
  gating. We report NMR studies in the absence and presence of NBD1 that
  provide structural details for the isolated R region and its interaction with
  NBD1 at residue-level resolution. Several sites in the R region with measured
  fractional helical propensity mediate interactions with NBD1. Phosphorylation
  reduces the helicity of many R-region sites and reduces their NBD1
  interactions. This evidence for a dynamic complex with NBD1 that transiently
  engages different sites of the R region suggests a structural explanation for
  the dependence of CFTR activity on multiple PKA phosphorylation sites.

    \field{abstract}{%
    The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is an anion
  channel evolved from an ATP-binding cassette transporter. CFTR channel gating
  is strictly coupled to phosphorylation and ATP hydrolysis. Previously, we
  reported essentially identical structures of zebrafish and human CFTR in the
  dephosphorylated, ATP-free form. Here, we present the structure of zebrafish
  CFTR in the phosphorylated, ATP-bound conformation, determined by
  cryoelectron microscopy to 3.4 \AA{} resolution. Comparison of the two
  conformations shows major structural rearrangements leading to channel
  opening. The phosphorylated regulatory domain is disengaged from its
  inhibitory position; the nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs) form a
  ``head-to-tail'' dimer upon binding ATP; and the cytoplasmic pathway, found
  closed off in other ATP-binding cassette transporters, is cracked open,
  consistent with CFTR's unique channel function. Unexpectedly, the
  extracellular mouth of the ion pore remains closed, indicating that local
  movements of the transmembrane helices can control ion access to the pore
  even in the NBD-dimerized conformation.%

    Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has recently provided invaluable
  experimental data about the full-length cystic fibrosis transmembrane
  conductance regulator (CFTR) 3D structure. However, this experimental
  information deals with inactive states of the channel, either in an apo,
  quiescent conformation, in which nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs) are widely
  separated or in an ATP-bound, yet closed conformation. Here, we show that 3D
  structure models of the open and closed forms of the channel, now further
  supported by metadynamics simulations and by comparison with the cryo-EM
  data, could be used to gain some insights into critical features of the
  conformational transition toward active CFTR forms. These critical elements
  lie within membrane-spanning domains but also within NBD1 and the N-terminal
  extension, in which conformational plasticity is predicted to occur to help
  the interaction with filamin, one of the CFTR cellular partners.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    CFTR (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator), a member of the
  ABC (ATP-binding cassette) superfamily of membrane proteins, possesses two
  NBDs (nucleotide-binding domains) in addition to two MSDs (membrane spanning
  domains) and the regulatory 'R' domain. The two NBDs of CFTR have been
  modelled as a heterodimer, stabilized by ATP binding at two sites in the NBD
  interface. It has been suggested that ATP hydrolysis occurs at only one of
  these sites as the putative catalytic base is only conserved in NBD2 of CFTR
  (Glu 1371), but not in NBD1 where the corresponding residue is a serine,
  Ser573. Previously, we showed that fragments of CFTR corresponding to NBD1
  and NBD2 can be purified and co-reconstituted to form a heterodimer capable
  of ATPase activity. In the present study, we show that the two NBD fragments
  form a complex in vivo, supporting the utility of this model system to
  evaluate the role of Glu1371 in ATP binding and hydrolysis. The present
  studies revealed that a mutant NBD2 (E1371Q) retains wild-type nucleotide
  binding affinity of NBD2. On the other hand, this substitution abolished the
  ATPase activity formed by the co-purified complex. Interestingly,
  introduction of a glutamate residue in place of the non-conserved Ser 573 in
  NBD1 did not confer additional ATPase activity by the heterodimer,
  implicating a vital role for multiple residues in formation of the catalytic
  site. These findings provide the first biochemical evidence suggesting that
  the Walker B residue: Glu1371, plays a primary role in the ATPase activity
  conferred by the NBD1-NBD2 heterodimer. \textcopyright{} 2007 Biochemical

    Small molecule chaperones have been exploited as therapeutics for the
  hundreds of diseases caused by protein misfolding. The most successful
  examples are the CFTR correctors, which transformed cystic fibrosis therapy.
  These molecules revert folding defects of the DF508 mutant and are widely
  used to treat patients. To investigate the molecular mechanism of their
  action, we determined cryo-electron microscopy structures of CFTR in complex
  with the FDA-approved correctors lumacaftor or tezacaftor. Both drugs insert
  into a hydrophobic pocket in the first transmembrane domain (TMD1), linking
  together four helices that are thermodynamically unstable. Mutating residues
  at the binding site rendered DF508-CFTR insensitive to lumacaftor and
  tezacaftor, underscoring the functional significance of the structural
  discovery. These results support a mechanism in which the correctors
  stabilize TMD1 at an early stage of biogenesis, prevent its premature
  degradation, and thereby allosterically rescuing many disease-causing
  mutations.%

    Background: Ivacaftor (KALYDECO\texttrademark, VX-770) is a CFTR
  potentiator that increased CFTR channel activity and improved lung function
  in patients age 6. years and older with CF who have the G551D-CFTR gating
  mutation. The aim of this in vitro study was to evaluate the effect of
  ivacaftor on mutant CFTR protein forms with defects in protein processing
  and/or channel function. Methods: The effect of ivacaftor on CFTR function
  was tested in electrophysiological studies using a panel of Fischer rat
  thyroid (FRT) cells expressing 54 missense CFTR mutations that cause defects
  in the amount or function of CFTR at the cell surface. Results: Ivacaftor
  potentiated multiple mutant CFTR protein forms that produce functional CFTR
  at the cell surface. These included mutant CFTR forms with mild defects in
  CFTR processing or mild defects in CFTR channel conductance. Conclusions:
  These in vitro data indicated that ivacaftor is a broad acting CFTR
  potentiator and could be used to help stratify patients with CF who have
  different CFTR genotypes for studies investigating the potential clinical
  benefit of ivacaftor. \textcopyright{} 2013 European Cystic Fibrosis

    Significant progress has been made in the development of CFTR modulator
  therapy; however, current CFTR modulator therapies are only available for a
  minority of the CF-patient population. Additionally, heterogeneity in in vivo
  modulator response has been reported among individuals carrying homozygous
  F508del-CFTR, adding to the desire for an optimal prediction of
  response-to-therapy on an individual level. In the last decade, a lot of
  progress has been made in the development of primary cell cultures into 3D
  patient-derived disease models. The advantage of these models is that the
  endogenous CFTR function is affected by the patient's mutation as well as
  other genetic or environmental factors. In this review we focus on intestinal
  organoids as in vitro model for CF, enabling for CF disease classification,
  drug development and treatment optimization in a personalized manner, taking
  into account rare CFTR mutations and clinical heterogeneity among individuals
  with CF.%

    We recently established conditions allowing for long-term expansion of
  epithelial organoids from intestine, recapitulating essential features of the
  in vivo tissue architecture. Here we apply this technology to study primary
  intestinal organoids of people suffering from cystic fibrosis, a disease
  caused by mutations in CFTR, encoding cystic fibrosis transmembrane
  conductance regulator. Forskolin induces rapid swelling of organoids derived
  from healthy controls or wild-type mice, but this effect is strongly reduced
  in organoids of subjects with cystic fibrosis or in mice carrying the Cftr
  F508del mutation and is absent in Cftr-deficient organoids. This pattern is
  phenocopied by CFTR-specific inhibitors. Forskolin-induced swelling of in
  vitro-expanded human control and cystic fibrosis organoids corresponds
  quantitatively with forskolin-induced anion currents in freshly excised ex
  vivo rectal biopsies. Function of the CFTR F508del mutant protein is restored
  by incubation at low temperature, as well as by CFTR-restoring compounds.
  This relatively simple and robust assay will facilitate diagnosis, functional
  studies, drug development and personalized medicine approaches in cystic
  fibrosis.%

    Mucociliary clearance (MCC) is the primary innate defense mechanism of the
  lung. The functional components are the protective mucous layer, the airway
  surface liquid layer, and the cilia on the surface of ciliated cells. The
  cilia are specialized organelles that beat in metachronal waves to propel
  pathogens and inhaled particles trapped in the mucous layer out of the
  airways. In health this clearance mechanism is effective, but in patients
  with primary cilia dyskinesia (PCD) the cilia are abnormal, resulting in
  deficient MCC and chronic lung disease. This demonstrates the critical
  importance of the cilia for human health. In this review, we summarize the
  current knowledge of the components of the MCC apparatus, focusing on the
  role of cilia in MCC., Ciliated cells in the lungs play a key role in
  mucociliary clearance, propelling inhaled particles out of the airways.
  Chronic diseases of the airways (e.g., primary ciliary dyskinesia) have
  offered insight into this process.%

    Cystic fibrosis is an autosomal recessive, monogenetic disorder caused by
  mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR)
  gene. The gene defect was first described 25 years ago and much progress has
  been made since then in our understanding of how CFTR mutations cause disease
  and how this can be addressed therapeutically. CFTR is a transmembrane
  protein that transports ions across the surface of epithelial cells. CFTR
  dysfunction affects many organs; however, lung disease is responsible for the
  vast majority of morbidity and mortality in patients with cystic fibrosis.
  Prenatal diagnostics, newborn screening and new treatment algorithms are
  changing the incidence and the prevalence of the disease. Until recently, the
  standard of care in cystic fibrosis treatment focused on preventing and
  treating complications of the disease; now, novel treatment strategies
  directly targeting the ion channel abnormality are becoming available and it
  will be important to evaluate how these treatments affect disease progression
  and the quality of life of patients. In this Primer, we summarize the current
  knowledge, and provide an outlook on how cystic fibrosis clinical care and
  research will be affected by new knowledge and therapeutic options in the
  near future. For an illustrated summary of this Primer, visit:

    Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is an ATP-gated
  anion channel with two remarkable distinctions. First, it is the only
  ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter that is known to be an ion
  channel-almost all others function as transport ATPases. Second, CFTR is the
  only ligand-gated channel that consumes its ligand (ATP) during the gating
  cycle-a consequence of its enzymatic activity as an ABC transporter. We
  discuss these special properties of CFTR in the context of its evolutionary
  history as an ABC transporter. Other topics include the mechanisms by which
  CFTR gating is regulated by phosphorylation of its unique regulatory domain
  and our current view of the CFTR permeation pathway (or pore). Understanding
  these basic operating principles of the CFTR channel is central to defining
  the mechanisms of action of prospective cystic fibrosis drugs and to the
  development of new, rational treatment strategies. \textcopyright{} 2013 Cold

    The debilitating symptoms of cystic fibrosis stem from the reduced Cl-
  permeability of epithelial cells owing to mutations in the gene encoding the
  cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) Cl- channel. In
  cells with normal CFTR channels, receptor-mediated activation of
  cyclic-AMP-dependent protein kinase causes phosphorylation of several serines
  in the regulatory domain of CFTR, permitting channel opening and closing via
  cycles involving ATP hydrolysis. Cellular phosphatases rapidly
  dephosphorylate the channels, inactivating them. Here we discuss recent

    The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is an
  ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter that uniquely functions as an ion
  channel. Here, we present a 3.9~\AA{} structure of dephosphorylated human
  CFTR without nucleotides, determined by electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM).
  Close resemblance of this human CFTR structure to zebrafish CFTR under
  identical conditions reinforces its relevance for understanding CFTR
  function. The human CFTR structure reveals a previously unresolved helix
  belonging to the R domain docked inside the intracellular vestibule,
  precluding channel opening. By analyzing the sigmoid time course of CFTR
  current activation, we propose that PKA phosphorylation of the R domain is
  enabled by its infrequent spontaneous disengagement, which also explains
  residual ATPase and gating activity of dephosphorylated CFTR. From comparison
  with MRP1, a feature distinguishing CFTR from all other ABC transporters is
  the helix-loop transition in transmembrane helix 8, which likely forms the
  structural basis for CFTR's channel function.%

    1. The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) chloride
  channel is activated by protein kinase A (PKA) phosphorylation of its R
  domain and by ATP binding at its nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs). Here we
  investigated the functional role of a cluster of acidic residues in the amino
  terminal tail (N-tail) that also modulate CFTR channel gating by an unknown
  mechanism. 2. A disease-associated mutant that lacks one of these acidic
  residues (D58N CFTR) exhibited lower macroscopic currents in Xenopus oocytes
  and faster deactivation following washout of a cAMP -activating cocktail than
  wild-type CFTR. 3. In excised membrane patches D58N CFTR exhibited a two-fold
  reduction in single channel open probability due primarily to shortened open
  channel bursts. 4. Replacing this and two nearby acidic residues with
  alanines (D47A, E54A, D58A) also reduced channel activity, but had negligible
  effects on bulk PKA phosphorylation or on the ATP dependence of channel
  activation. 5. Conversely, the N-tail triple mutant exhibited a markedly
  inhibited response to AMP-PNP, a poorly hydrolysable ATP analogue that can
  nearly lock open the wild-type channel. The N-tail mutant had both a slower
  response to AMP-PNP (activation half-time of 140 {$\pm$} 20 s vs. 21 {$\pm$}
  4 s for wild type) and a lower steady-state open probability following
  AMP-PNP addition (0.68 {$\pm$} 0.08 vs. 0.92 {$\pm$} 0.03 for wild type). 6.
  Introducing the N-tail mutations into K1250A CFTR, an NBD2 hydrolysis mutant
  that normally exhibits very long open channel bursts, destabilized the
  activity of this mutant as evidenced by decreased macroscopic currents and
  shortened open channel bursts. 7. We propose that this cluster of acidic
  residues modulates the stability of CFTR channel openings at a step that is
  downstream of ATP binding and upstream of ATP hydrolysis, probably at NBD2.%

    Over 1,500 cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene
  sequence variations have been identified in patients with cystic fibrosis
  (CF) and related disorders involving an impaired function of the CFTR
  chloride channel. However, detailed structure-function analyses have only
  been established for a few of them. This study aimed evaluating the impact of
  eight N-terminus CFTR natural missense changes on channel behavior. By
  site-directed mutagenesis, we generated four CFTR variants in the N-terminal
  cytoplasmic tail (p.P5L, p.S50P, p.E60K, and p.R75Q) and four in the first
  transmembrane segment of membrane-spanning domain 1 (p.G85E/V, p.Y89C, and
  p.E92K). Immunoblot analysis revealed that p.S50P, p.E60K, p.G85E/V, and
  p.E92K produced only core-glycosylated proteins. Immunofluorescence and whole
  cell patch-clamp confirmed intracellular retention, thus reflecting a defect
  of CFTR folding and/or trafficking. In contrast, both p.R75Q and p.Y89C had a
  glycosylation pattern and a subcellular distribution comparable to the
  wild-type CFTR, while the percentage of mature p.P5L was considerably
  reduced, suggesting a major biogenesis flaw on this channel. Nevertheless,
  whole-cell chloride currents were recorded for all three variants.
  Single-channel patch-clamp analyses revealed that the channel activity of
  p.R75Q appeared similar to that of the wild-type CFTR, while both p.P5L and
  p.Y89C channels displayed abnormal gating. Overall, our results predict a
  major impact of the CFTR missense variants analyzed, except p.R75Q, on the CF
  phenotype and highlight the importance of the CFTR N-terminus on channel
  physiology. \textcopyright{} 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.%

    Efficient endocytosis of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance
  regulator (CFTR) is mediated by a tyrosine-based internalization signal in
  the CFTR carboxyl-terminal tail 1424YDSI1427. In the present studies, two
  naturally occurring cystic fibrosis mutations in the amino terminus of CFTR,
  R31C, and R31L were examined. To determine the defect that these mutations
  cause, the Arg-31 mutants were expressed in COS-7 cells and their biogenesis
  and trafficking to the cell surface tested in metabolic pulse-chase and
  surface biotinylation assays, respectively. The results indicated that both
  Arg-31 mutants were processed to band C at {$\sim$}50\% the efficiency of the
  wild-type protein. However, once processed and delivered to the cell surface,
  their half-lives were the same as wildtype protein. Interestingly, indirect
  immunofluorescence and cell surface biotinylation indicated that the surface
  pool was much smaller than could be accounted for based on the biogenesis
  defect alone. Therefore, the Arg-31 mutants were tested in internalization
  assays and found to be internalized at 2x the rate of the wild-type protein.
  Patch clamp and 6-methoxy-N-(3-sulfopropyl)quinolinium analysis confirmed
  reduced amounts of functional Arg-31 channels at the cell surface. Together,
  the results suggest that both R31C and R31L mutations compromise biogenesis
  and enhance internalization of CFTR. These two additive effects contribute to
  the loss of surface expression and the associated defect in chloride
  conductance that is consistent with a disease phenotype. \textcopyright{}

    Patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) harboring the P67L variant in the cystic
  fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) often exhibit a typical
  CF phenotype, including severe respiratory compromise. This rare mutation
  (reported in {$<$}300 patients worldwide) responds robustly to CFTR
  correctors, such as lumacaftor and tezacaftor, with rescue in model systems
  that far exceed what can be achieved for the archetypical CFTR mutant
  F508del. However, the specific molecular consequences of the P67L mutation
  are poorly characterized. In this study, we conducted biochemical
  measurements following low-temperature growth and/or intragenic suppression,
  which suggest a mechanism underlying P67L that (1) shares key pathogenic
  features with F508del, including off-pathway (non-native) folding
  intermediates, (2) is linked to folding stability of nucleotide-binding
  domains 1 and 2, and (3) demonstrates pharmacologic rescue that requires
  domains in the carboxyl half of the protein. We also investigated the "lasso"
  helices 1 and 2, which occur immediately upstream of P67. Based on limited
  proteolysis, pulse chase, and molecular dynamics analysis of full-length CFTR
  and a series of deletion constructs, we argue that P67L and other
  maturational processing (class 2) defects impair the integrity of the lasso
  motif and confer misfolding of downstream domains. Thus, amino-terminal
  missense variants elicit a conformational change throughout CFTR that
  abrogates maturation while providing a robust substrate for pharmacologic
  repair.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    Processing mutations that inhibit folding and trafficking of CFTR are the
  main cause of cystic fibrosis (CF). A potential CF therapy would be to repair
  CFTR processing mutants. It has been demonstrated that processing mutants of
  P-glycoprotein (P-gp), CFTR's sister protein, can be efficiently repaired by
  a drug-rescue mechanism. Many arginine suppressors that mimic drug-rescue
  have been identified in the P-gp transmembrane (TM) domains (TMDs) that
  rescue by forming hydrogen bonds with residues in adjacent helices to promote
  packing of the TM segments. To test if CFTR mutants could be repaired by a
  drug-rescue mechanism, we used truncation mutants to test if corrector VX-809
  interacted with the TMDs. VX-809 was selected for study because it is
  specific for CFTR, it is the most effective corrector identified to date, but
  it has limited clinical benefit. Identification of the VX-809 target domain
  will help to develop correctors with improved clinical benefits. It was found
  that VX-809 rescued truncation mutants lacking the NBD2 and R domains. When
  the remaining domains (TMD1, NBD1, TMD2) were expressed as separate
  polypeptides, VX-809 only increased the stability of TMD1. We then performed
  arginine mutagenesis on TM6 in TMD1. Although the results showed that TM6 had
  distinct lipid and aqueous faces, CFTR was different from P-gp as no arginine
  promoted maturation of CFTR processing mutants. The results suggest that TMD1
  contains a VX-809 binding site, but its mechanism differed from P-gp
  drug-rescue. We also report that V510D acts as a universal suppressor to
  rescue CFTR processing mutants. \textcopyright{} 2013 Elsevier Inc. All

    \field{abstract}{%
    Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a fatal genetic disorder associated with defective
  hydration of lung airways due to the loss of chloride transport through the
  CF transmembrane conductance regulator protein (CFTR). CFTR contains two
  membrane-spanning domains (MSDs), two nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs), and
  a regulatory domain, and its channel assembly requires multiple interdomain
  contacts. The most common CF-causing mutation, F508del, occurs in NBD1 and
  results in misfolding and premature degradation of F508del-CFTR. VX-809 is an
  investigational CFTR corrector that partially restores CFTR function in
  people who are homozygous for F508del-CFTR. To identify the folding defect(s)
  in F508del-CFTR that must be repaired to treat CF, we explored the mechanism
  of VX-809 action. VX-809 stabilized an N-terminal domain in CFTR that
  contains only MSD1 and efficaciously restored function to CFTR forms that
  have missense mutations in MSD1. The action of VX-809 on MSD1 appears to
  suppress folding defects in F508del-CFTR by enhancing interactions among the
  NBD1, MSD1, and MSD2 domains. The ability of VX-809 to correct F508del-CFTR
  is enhanced when combined with mutations that improve F508del-NBD1
  interaction with MSD2. These data suggest that the use of VX-809 in
  combination with an additional CFTR corrector that suppresses folding defects
  downstream of MSD1 may further enhance CFTR function in people with
  F508del-CFTR. \textcopyright{} 2013 Ren et al.%

    A large number of correctors have been identified that can partially repair
  defects in folding, stability and trafficking of CFTR processing mutants that
  cause cystic fibrosis (CF). The best corrector, VX-809 (Lumacaftor), has
  shown some promise when used in combination with a potentiator (Ivacaftor).
  Understanding the mechanism of VX-809 is essential for development of better
  correctors. Here, we tested our prediction that VX-809 repairs folding and
  processing defects of CFTR by promoting interactions between the first
  cytoplasmic loop (CL1) of transmembrane domain 1 (TMD1) and the first
  nucleotide-binding domain (NBD1). To investigate whether VX-809 promoted
  CL1/NBD1 interactions, we performed cysteine mutagenesis and disulfide
  cross-linking analysis of Cys-less TMD1 (residues 1\textendash 436) and
  {$\Delta$}TMD1 (residues 437\textendash 1480; NBD1-R-TMD2-NBD2) truncation
  mutants. It was found that VX-809, but not bithiazole correctors, promoted
  maturation (exited endoplasmic reticulum for addition of complex carbohydrate
  in the Golgi) of the {$\Delta$}TMD1 truncation mutant only when it was
  co-expressed in the presence of TMD1. Expression in the presence of VX-809
  also promoted cross-linking between R170C (in CL1 of TMD1 protein) and L475C
  (in NBD1 of the {$\Delta$}TMD1 truncation protein). Expression of the
  {$\Delta$}TMD1 truncation mutant in the presence of TMD1 and VX-809 also
  increased the half-life of the mature protein in cells. The results suggest
  that the mechanism by which VX-809 promotes maturation and stability of CFTR
  is by promoting CL1/NBD1 interactions.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    Understanding the mechanism of action of modulator compounds for the cystic
  fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is key for the
  optimization of therapeutics as well as obtaining insights into the molecular
  mechanisms of CFTR function. We demonstrate the direct binding of VX-809 to
  the first nucleotide-binding domain (NBD1) of human CFTR. Disruption of the
  interaction between C-terminal helices and the NBD1 core upon VX-809 binding
  is observed from chemical shift changes in the NMR spectra of residues in the
  helices and on the surface of b-strands S3, S9, and S10. Binding to VX-809
  leads to a significant negative shift in NBD1 thermal melting temperature
  (Tm), pointing to direct VX-809 interaction shifting the NBD1 conformational
  equilibrium. An inter-residue correlation analysis of the chemical shift
  changes provides evidence of allosteric coupling between the direct binding
  site and the NBD1:CL4 interface, thus enabling effects on the interface in
  the absence of direct binding in that location. These NMR binding data and
  the negative Tm shifts are very similar to those previously reported by us
  for binding of the dual corrector-potentiator CFFT-001 to NBD1 (Hudson et
  al., 2012), suggesting that the two compounds may share some aspects of their
  mechanisms of action. Although previous studies have shown an important role
  for VX-809 in modulating the conformation of the first membrane spanning
  domain (Aleksandrov et al., 2012; Ren et al., 2013), this additional mode of
  VX-809 binding provides insight into conformational dynamics and allostery
  within CFTR.%

    The most common cystic fibrosis mutation, {$\Delta$}F508 in nucleotide
  binding domain 1 (NBD1), impairs cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance
  regulator (CFTR)-coupled domain folding, plasma membrane expression, function
  and stability. VX-809, a promising investigational corrector of
  {$\Delta$}F508-CFTR misprocessing, has limited clinical benefit and an
  incompletely understood mechanism, hampering drug development. Given the
  effect of second-site suppressor mutations, robust {$\Delta$}F508-CFTR
  correction most likely requires stabilization of NBD1 energetics and the
  interface between membrane-spanning domains (MSDs) and NBD1, which are both
  established primary conformational defects. Here we elucidate the molecular
  targets of available correctors: class I stabilizes the NBD1-MSD1 and
  NBD1-MSD2 interfaces, and class II targets NBD2. Only chemical chaperones,
  surrogates of class III correctors, stabilize human {$\Delta$}F508-NBD1.
  Although VX-809 can correct missense mutations primarily destabilizing the
  NBD1-MSD1/2 interface, functional plasma membrane expression of
  {$\Delta$}F508-CFTR also requires compounds that counteract the NBD1 and NBD2
  stability defects in cystic fibrosis bronchial epithelial cells and
  intestinal organoids. Thus, the combination of structure-guided correctors
  represents an effective approach for cystic fibrosis therapy \textcopyright{}

    In~vitro drug tests using patient-derived stem cell cultures offer
  opportunities to individually select efficacious treatments. Here, we provide
  a study that demonstrates that in~vitro drug responses in rectal organoids
  from individual patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) correlate with changes in
  two in~vivo therapeutic endpoints. We measured individual in~vitro
  efficaciousness using a functional assay in~rectum-derived organoids based on
  forskolin-induced swelling and studied the correlation with in~vivo effects.
  The in~vitro organoid responses correlated with both change in pulmonary
  response and change in sweat chloride concentration. Receiver operating
  characteristic curves indicated good-to-excellent accuracy of the
  organoid-based test for defining clinical responses. This study indicates
  that an in~vitro assay using stem cell cultures can prospectively select
  efficacious treatments for patients and suggests that biobanked stem cell
  resources can be used to tailor individual treatments in a cost-effective and
  patient-friendly manner.%

    Rationale: Given the vast number of cystic fibrosis transmembrane
  conductance regulator (CFTR) mutations, biomarkers predicting benefit from
  CFTR modulator therapies are needed for subjects with cystic fibrosis (CF).
  Objectives: To study CFTR function in organoids of subjects with common and
  rare CFTR mutations and evaluate correlations between CFTR function and
  clinical data. Methods: Intestinal organoids were grown from rectal biopsies
  in a cohort of 97 subjects with CF. Residual CFTR function was measured by
  quantifying organoid swelling induced by forskolin and response to modulators
  by quantifying organoid swelling induced by CFTR correctors, potentiator and
  their combination. Organoid data were correlated with clinical data from the
  literature. Results: Across 28 genotypes, residual CFTR function correlated
  (r2=0.87) with sweat chloride values. When studying the same genotypes, CFTR
  function rescue by CFTR modulators in organoids correlated tightly with mean
  improvement in lung function (r2=0.90) and sweat chloride (r2=0.95) reported
  in clinical trials. We identified candidate genotypes for modulator therapy,
  such as E92K, Q237E, R334W and L159S. Based on organoid results, two subjects
  started modulator treatment: one homozygous for complex allele Q359K-T360K,
  and the second with mutation E60K. Both subjects had major clinical benefit.
  Conclusions: Measurements of residual CFTR function and rescue of function by
  CFTR modulators in intestinal organoids correlate closely with clinical data.
  Our results for reference genotypes concur with previous results. CFTR
  function measured in organoids can be used to guide precision medicine in
  patients with CF, positioning organoids as a potential in vitro model to
  bring treatment to patients carrying rare CFTR mutations.%

    The intestinal epithelium is the most rapidly self-renewing tissue in adult
  mammals. We have recently demonstrated the presence of about six cycling Lgr5
  + stem cells at the bottoms of small-intestinal crypts. Here we describe the
  establishment of long-term culture conditions under which single crypts
  undergo multiple crypt fission events, while simultanously generating
  villus-like epithelial domains in which all differentiated cell types are
  present. Single sorted Lgr5 + stem cells can also initiate these crypt-villus
  organoids. Tracing experiments indicate that the Lgr5 + stem-cell hierarchy
  is maintained in organoids. We conclude that intestinal crypt-villus units
  are self-organizing structures, which can be built from a single stem cell in
  the absence of a non-epithelial cellular niche. \textcopyright{} 2009

    Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an inherited disorder where individual disease
  etiology and response to therapeutic intervention is impacted by CF
  transmembrane regulator (CFTR) mutations and other genetic modifiers. CFTR
  regulates multiple mechanisms in a diverse range of epithelial tissues. In
  this Review, we consolidate the latest updates in the development of primary
  epithelial cellular model systems relevant for CF. We discuss conventional
  two-dimensional (2-D) airway epithelial cell cultures, the backbone of in
  vitro cellular models to date, as well as improved expansion protocols to
  overcome finite supply of the cellular source. We highlight a range of
  strategies for establishment of three dimensional (3-D) airway and intestinal
  organoid models and evaluate the limitations and potential improvements in
  each system, focusing on their application in CF. The in vitro CFTR
  functional assays in patient-derived organoids allow for preclinical
  pharmacotherapy screening to identify responsive patients. It is likely that
  organoids will be an invaluable preclinical tool to unravel disease
  mechanisms, design novel treatments, and enable clinicians to provide
  personalized management for patients with CF.%

    Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are a recently developed technology
  in which fully differentiated cells such as fibroblasts from individual CF
  patients can be repaired with [wildtype] CFTR, and reprogrammed to
  differentiate into fully differentiated cells characteristic of the proximal
  and distal airways. Here, we review properties of different epithelial cells
  in the airway, and the in vitro genetic roadmap which iPSCs follow as they
  are step-wise differentiated into either basal stem cells, for the proximal
  airway, or into Type II Alveolar cells for the distal airways. The central
  theme is that iPSC-derived basal stem cells, are penultimately dependent on
  NOTCH signaling for differentiation into club cells, goblet cells, ciliated
  cells, and neuroendocrine cells. Furthermore, given the proper matrix, these
  cellular progenies are also able to self-assemble into a fully functional
  pseudostratified squamous proximal airway epithelium. By contrast, club cells
  are reserve stem cells which are able to either differentiate into goblet or
  ciliated cells, but also to de-differentiate into basal stem cells. Variant
  club cells, located at the transition between airway and alveoli, may also be
  responsible for differentiation into Type II Alveolar cells, which then
  differentiate into Type I Alveolar cells for gas exchange in the distal
  airway. Using gene editing, the mutant CFTR gene in iPSCs from CF patients
  can be repaired, and fully functional epithelial cells can thus be generated
  through directed differentiation. However, there is a limitation in that the
  lung has other CFTR-dependent cells besides epithelial cells. Another
  limitation is that there are CFTR-dependent cells in other organs which would
  continue to contribute to CF disease. Furthermore, there are also bystander
  or modifier genes which affect disease outcome, not only in the lung, but
  specifically in other CF-affected organs. Finally, we discuss future
  personalized applications of the iPSC technology, many of which have already
  survived the ``proof-of-principle'' test. These include (i) patient-derived
  iPSCs used as a ``lung-on-a-chip'' tool for personalized drug discovery; (ii)
  replacement of mutant lung cells by wildtype lung cells in the living lung;
  and (iii) development of bio-artificial lungs. It is hoped that this review
  will give the reader a roadmap through the most complicated of the obstacles,
  and foster a guardedly optimistic view of how some of the remaining obstacles
  might one day be overcome.%

    The recent FDA approval of two drugs to treat the basic defect in cystic
  fibrosis has given hope to patients and their families battling this
  devastating disease. Over many years, with heavy financial investment from
  Vertex Pharmaceuticals and the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, pre-clinical
  evaluation of thousands of synthetic drugs resulted in the production of
  Kalydeco and Orkambi. Yet, despite the success of this endeavor, many other
  compounds have been proposed as therapeutic agents in the treatment of CF. Of
  note, several of these compounds are naturally occurring, and are present in
  spices from the grocery store and over the counter preparations in health
  food stores. In this short review, we look at three such compounds,

    Intestinal current measurements (ICM) from rectal biopsies are a sensitive
  means to detect cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR)
  function, but have not been optimized for multicenter use. We piloted
  multicenter standard operating procedures (SOPs) to detect CFTR activity by
  ICM and examined key questions for use in clinical trials. SOPs for ICM using
  human rectal biopsies were developed across three centers and used to
  characterize ion transport from non-CF and CF subjects (two severe CFTR
  mutations). All data were centrally evaluated by a blinded interpreter. SOPs
  were then used across four centers to examine the effect of cold storage on
  CFTR currents and compare CFTR currents in biopsies from one subject studied
  simultaneously either at two sites (24 hours post-biopsy) or when biopsies
  were obtained by either forceps or suction. Rectal biopsies from 44 non-CF
  and 17 CF subjects were analyzed. Mean differences ({$\mu$}A/cm2; 95\%
  confidence intervals) between CF and non-CF were forskolin/IBMX=102.6(128.0
  to 81.1), carbachol=96.3(118.7 to 73.9), forskolin/IBMX+carbachol=200.9(243.1
  to 158.6), and bumetanide=-44.6 (-33.7 to -55.6) (P{$<$}0.005, CF vs non-CF
  for all parameters). Receiver Operating Characteristic curves indicated that
  each parameter discriminated CF from non-CF subjects (area under the curve of
  0.94-0.98). CFTR dependent currents following 18-24 hours of cold storage for
  forskolin/IBMX, carbachol, and forskolin/IBMX+carbachol stimulation (n=17
  non-CF subjects) were 44\%, 47.5\%, and 47.3\%, respectively of those in
  fresh biopsies. CFTR-dependent currents from biopsies studied after cold
  storage at two sites simultaneously demonstrated moderate correlation (n=14
  non-CF subjects, Pearson correlation coefficients 0.389, 0.484, and 0.533).
  Similar CFTR dependent currents were detected from fresh biopsies obtained by
  either forceps or suction (within-subject comparisons, n=22 biopsies from
  three non-CF subjects). Multicenter ICM is a feasible CFTR outcome measure
  that discriminates CF from non-CF ion transport, offers unique advantages
  over other CFTR bioassays, and warrants further development as a potential
  CFTR biomarker. \textcopyright{} 2013 Clancy et al.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    Previous Ussing chamber measurements of secretagogue-provoked changes in
  short circuit current in rectal suction biopsies of cystic fibrosis (CF)
  patients showed that in a minority of patients chloride secretion in response
  to cholinergic agonists is reduced but not completely absent. To assess a
  possible relationship between this phenomenon and both the genotype and the
  phenotype, we performed Ussing chamber experiments on rectal suction biopsies
  of 51 CF patients. The CF mutation was identified in 89 out of 102 CF
  alleles. No apparent chloride secretion was found in 30 CF patients (group
  I). Low residual chloride secretion was found in 11 CF patients (group II),
  while a relatively high residual secretion appeared in 10 CF patients (group
  III). Pancreatic function was preserved more frequently in CF patients
  displaying residual secretion: 0\% in group I, 27\% in group II, and 60\% in
  group III (P {$<$} 0.001). The age at diagnosis (mean{$\pm$}SEM) in group III
  (18.4{$\pm$}6.6) was significantly different from group I (1.2{$\pm$}0.4, P
  {$<$} 0.01) and group II (3.5{$\pm$}1.4, P = 0.05). Residual chloride
  secretion was found in some of the 28 dF508 homozygous patients (three in
  group II, and one in group III), disclosing that other factors than the CF
  gene defect itself affect the transepithelial chloride transport. The age at
  diagnosis correlates significantly with the magnitude of the secretory
  response, even within the dF508 homozygous patients (r = 0.4, P {$<$} 0.05).
  We conclude that residual chloride secretion in CF is the pathophysiological
  basis of preserved pancreatic function and delayed presentation of the
  disease, which is not exclusively determined by the CF genotype.%

    The potentiator VX-770 (ivacaftor/KALYDECO\texttrademark ) targets
  defective gating of CFTR and has been approved for treatment of cystic
  fibrosis (CF) subjects carrying G551D, S1251N or one of 8 other mutations.
  Still, the current potentiator treatment does not normalize CFTR-dependent
  biomarkers, indicating the need for development of more effective potentiator
  strategies. We have recently pioneered a functional CFTR assay in primary
  rectal organoids and used this model to characterize interactions between
  VX-770, genistein and curcumin, the latter 2 being natural food components
  with established CFTR potentiation capacities. Results indicated that all
  possible combinations of VX-770, genistein and curcumin synergistically
  repaired CFTR-dependent forskolin-induced swelling of organoids with
  CFTR-S1251N or CFTR-G551D, even under suboptimal CFTR activation and
  compounds concentrations, conditions that may predominate in vivo. Genistein
  and curcumin also enhanced forskolin-induced swelling of F508del homozygous
  organoids that were treated with VX-770 and the prototypical CFTR corrector
  VX-809. These results indicate that VX-770, genistein and curcumin in double
  or triple combinations can synergize in restoring CFTR-dependent fluid
  secretion in primary CF cells and support the use of multiple potentiators
  for treatment of CF.%

    Diagnosing cystic fibrosis (CF) when sweat chloride is not in the CF range
  and less than 2 disease-causing CFTR mutations are found requires
  physiological CFTR assays, which are not always feasible or available. We
  developed a new physiological CFTR assay based on the morphological
  differences between rectal organoids from subjects with and without CF. In
  organoids from 167 subjects with and 22 without CF, two parameters derived
  from a semi-automated image analysis protocol (rectal organoid morphology
  analysis, ROMA) fully discriminated CF subjects with two disease-causing
  mutations from non-CF subjects (p{$<$}0.001). ROMA, feasible at all ages, can
  be centralised to improve standardisation.%

    Background: New functional assays using primary human intestinal adult stem
  cell cultures can be valuable tools to study epithelial defects in human
  diseases such as cystic fibrosis. Methods: CFTR-mediated ion transport was
  measured in rectal organoid-derived monolayers grown from subjects with
  various CFTR mutations and compared to donor-matched intestinal current
  measurements (ICM) in rectal biopsies and forskolin-induced swelling of
  rectal organoids. Results: Rectal organoid-derived monolayers were generated
  within four days. Ion transport measurements of CFTR function using these
  monolayers correlated with ICM and organoid swelling (r = 0.73 and 0.79
  respectively). Culturing the monolayers under differentiation conditions
  enhanced the detection of mucus-secreting cells and was accompanied by
  reduced CFTR function. Conclusions: CFTR-dependent intestinal epithelial ion
  transport properties can be measured in rectal organoid-derived monolayers of
  subjects and correlate with donor-matched ICM and rectal organoid swelling.%

    Positive results in pre-clinical studies of the triple combination of
  elexacaftor, tezacaftor and ivacaftor, performed in airway epithelial cell
  cultures obtained from patients harbouring the class II cystic fibrosis
  transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) mutation F508del-CFTR, translated
  to impressive clinical outcomes for subjects carrying this mutation in
  clinical trials and approval of Trikafta. Encouraged by this correlation, we
  were prompted to evaluate the effect of the elexacaftor, tezacaftor and
  ivacaftor triple combination on primary nasal epithelial cultures obtained
  from individuals with rare class II CF-causing mutations (G85E, M1101K and
  N1303K) for which Trikafta is not approved. Cultures from individuals
  homozygous for M1101K responded better than cultures harbouring G85E and
  N1303K after treatment with the triple combination with respect to
  improvement in regulated channel function and protein processing. A similar
  genotype-specific effect of the triple combination was observed when the
  different mutations were expressed in HEK293 cells, supporting the hypothesis
  that these modulators may act directly on the mutant proteins. Detailed
  studies in nasal cultures and HEK293 cells showed that the corrector,
  elexacaftor, exhibited dual activity as both corrector and potentiator, and
  suggested that the potentiator activity contributes to its pharmacological
  activity. These pre-clinical studies using nasal epithelial cultures
  identified mutation genotypes for which elexacaftor, tezacaftor and ivacaftor
  may produce clinical responses that are comparable to, or inferior to, those
  observed for F508del-CFTR.%

    Cystic fibrosis (CF) is caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis
  transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), which lead to early death due to
  progressive lung disease. The development of small-molecule modulators that
  directly interact with CFTR to aid in protein folding (``correctors'') and/or
  increase channel function (``potentiators'') have proven to be highly
  effective in the therapeutic treatment of CF. Notably, incorporation of the
  next-generation CFTR corrector, elexacaftor, into a triple combination
  therapeutic (marketed as Trikafta) has shown tremendous clinical promise in
  treating CF caused by F508del-CFTR. Here, we report on a newly-described role
  of elexacaftor as a CFTR potentiator. We explore the acute and chronic
  actions, pharmacology, and efficacy of elexacaftor as a CFTR potentiator in
  restoring function to multiple classes of CFTR mutations. We demonstrate that
  the potentiating action of elexacaftor exhibits multiplicative synergy with
  the established CFTR potentiator ivacaftor in rescuing multiple CFTR class
  defects, indicating that a new combination therapeutic of ivacaftor and
  elexacaftor could have broad impact on CF therapies.%

    Trikafta, a triple-combination drug, consisting of folding correctors
  VX-661 (tezacaftor), VX-445 (elexacaftor) and the gating potentiator VX-770
  (ivacaftor) provided unprecedented clinical benefits for patients with the
  most common cystic fibrosis (CF) mutation, F508del. Trikafta indications were
  recently expanded to additional 177 mutations in the CF transmembrane
  conductance regulator (CFTR). To minimize life-long pharmacological and
  financial burden of drug administration, if possi-ble, we determined the
  necessary and sufficient modulator combination that can achieve maximal
  benefit in preclinical setting for selected mutants. To this end, the
  biochemical and functional rescue of single corrector-responsive rare mutants
  were investigated in a bronchial epithelial cell line and patient-derived
  human primary nasal epithelia (HNE), respectively. The plasma membrane
  density of P67L-, L206W-or S549R-CFTR corrected by VX-661 or other type I
  correctors was moderately increased by VX-445. Short-circuit current
  measurements of HNE, however, uncovered that correction comparable to
  Trikafta was achieved for S549R-CFTR by VX-661 + VX-770 and for P67L-and
  L206W-CFTR by the VX-661 + VX-445 combination. Thus, introduction of a third
  modulator may not provide additional benefit for patients with a subset of
  rare CFTR missense mutations. These results also underscore that HNE, as a
  precision medicine model, enable the optimization of mutation-specific
  modulator combinations to maximize their efficacy and minimize life-long drug
  exposure of CF patients.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    Cystic fibrosis (CF) is caused by mutations in the CF transmembrane
  conductance regulator (CFTR) gene that impair the function of CFTR, an
  epithelial chloride channel required for proper function of the lung,
  pancreas, and other organs. Most patients with CF carry the F508del CFTR
  mutation, which causes defective CFTR protein folding and processing in the
  endoplasmic reticulum, resulting in minimal amounts of CFTR at the cell
  surface. One strategy to treat these patients is to correct the processing of
  F508del-CFTR with small molecules. Here we describe the in vitro pharmacology
  of VX-809, a CFTR corrector that was advanced into clinical development for
  the treatment of CF. In cultured human bronchial epithelial cells isolated
  from patients with CF homozygous for F508del, VX-809 improved F508del-CFTR
  processing in the endoplasmic reticulum and enhanced chloride secretion to
  approximately 14\% of non-CF human bronchial epithelial cells (EC(50), 81
  {$\pm$} 19 nM), a level associated with mild CF in patients with less
  disruptive CFTR mutations. F508del-CFTR corrected by VX-809 exhibited
  biochemical and functional characteristics similar to normal CFTR, including
  biochemical susceptibility to proteolysis, residence time in the plasma
  membrane, and single-channel open probability. VX-809 was more efficacious
  and selective for CFTR than previously reported CFTR correctors. VX-809
  represents a class of CFTR corrector that specifically addresses the
  underlying processing defect in F508del-CFTR.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    The past two decades have witnessed major breakthroughs in developing
  compounds that target the chloride channel CFTR for the treatment of patients
  with cystic fibrosis. However, further improvement in affinity and efficacy
  for these CFTR modulators will require insights into the molecular
  interactions between CFTR modulators and their binding targets. In this
  study, we use in silico molecular docking to identify potential binding sites
  for GLPG1837, a CFTR potentiator that may share a common mechanism and
  binding site with VX-770, the FDA-approved drug for patients carrying
  mutations with gating defects. Among the five binding sites predicted by
  docking, the two top-scoring sites are located at the interface between
  CFTR's two transmembrane domains: Site I consists of D924, N1138, and S1141,
  and site IIN includes F229, F236, Y304, F312, and F931. Using mutagenesis to
  probe the importance of these sites for GLPG187 binding, we find that
  disruption of predicted hydrogenbonding interactions by mutation of D924
  decreases apparent affinity, while hydrophobic amino acids substitutions at
  N1138 and introduction of positively charged amino acids at S1141 improve the
  apparent affinity for GLPG1837. Alanine substitutions at Y304, F312, and F931
  (site IIN) decrease the affinity for GLPG1837, whereas alanine substitutions
  at F229 and F236 (also site IIN), or at residues in the other three
  lower-scoring sites, have little effect. In addition, current relaxation
  analysis to assess the apparent dissociation rate of VX-770 yields results
  consistent with the dose-response experiments for GLPG8137, with the
  dissociation rate of VX-770 accelerated by D924N, F236A, Y304A, and F312A,
  but decelerated by N1138L and S1141K mutations. Collectively, these data
  identify two potential binding sites for GLPG1837 and VX-770 in CFTR. We
  discuss the pros and cons of evidence for these two loci and the implications
  for future drug design.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a fatal genetic disease caused by mutations in the
  gene encoding the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), a protein
  kinase A (PKA)-activated epithelial anion channel involved in salt and fluid
  transport in multiple organs, including the lung. Most CF mutations either
  reduce the number of CFTR channels at the cell surface (e.g., synthesis or
  processing mutations) or impair channel function (e.g., gating or conductance
  mutations) or both. There are currently no approved therapies that target
  CFTR. Here we describe the in vitro pharmacology of VX-770, an orally
  bioavailable CFTR potentiator in clinical development for the treatment of
  CF. In recombinant cells VX-770 increased CFTR channel open probability (Po)
  in both the F508del processing mutation and the G551D gating mutation. VX-770
  also increased Cl - secretion in cultured human CF bronchial epithelia (HBE)
  carrying the G551D gating mutation on one allele and the F508del processing
  mutation on the other allele by {$\approx$}10-fold, to {$\approx$}50\% of
  that observed in HBE isolated from individuals without CF. Furthermore,
  VX-770 reduced excessive Na+ and fluid absorption to prevent dehydration of
  the apical surface and increased cilia beating in these epithelial cultures.
  These results support the hypothesis that pharmacological agents that restore
  or increase CFTR function can rescue epithelial cell function in human CF
  airway.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a channelopathy caused by loss-of-function
  mutations of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR)
  gene, which encodes a phosphorylation-activated and adenosine triphosphate
  (ATP)-gated chloride channel. In the past few years, high-throughput drug
  screening has successfully realized the first US Food and Drug
  Administration-approved therapy for CF, called ivacaftor (or VX-770). A more
  recent CFTR potentiator, GLPG1837
  (N-(3-carbamoyl-5,5,7,7-tetramethyl-4,7-dihydro-5H-thieno[2,3-c]
  pyran-2-yl)-1H-pyrazole-3-carboxamide), has been shown to exhibit a higher
  efficacy than ivacaftor for the G551D mutation, yet the underlying mechanism
  of GLPG1837 remains unclear. Here we find that despite their differences in
  potency and efficacy, GLPG1837 and VX-770 potentiate CFTR gating in a
  remarkably similar manner. Specifically, they share similar effects on
  single-channel kinetics of wild-type CFTR. Their actions are independent of
  nucleotide-binding domain (NBD) dimerization and ATP hydrolysis, critical
  steps controlling CFTR's gate opening and closing, respectively. By applying
  the two reagents together, we provide evidence that GLPG1837 and VX-770
  likely compete for the same site, whereas GLPG1837 and the high-affinity ATP
  analogue 2'-deoxy-N6-(2-phenylethyl)-adenosine-5'-O-triphosphate (dPATP) work
  synergistically through two different sites. We also find that the apparent
  affinity for GLPG1837 is dependent on the open probability of the channel,
  suggesting a state-dependent binding of the drug to CFTR (higher binding
  affinity for the open state than the closed state), which is consistent with
  the classic mechanism for allosteric modulation. We propose a simple
  four-state kinetic model featuring an energetic coupling between CFTR gating
  and potentiator binding to explain our experimental results.%

    There is still a high unmet need for the treatment of most patients with
  cystic fibrosis (CF). The identification and development of new Cystic
  Fibrosis Transmembrane conductance Regulator (CFTR) modulators is necessary
  to achieve higher clinical benefit in patients. In this report we describe
  the characterization of novel potentiators. From a small screening campaign
  on F508del CFTR, hits were developed leading to the identification of
  pre-clinical candidates GLPG1837 and GLPG2451, each derived from a distinct
  chemical series. Both drug candidates enhance WT CFTR activity as well as low
  temperature or corrector rescued F508del CFTR, and are able to improve
  channel activity on a series of Class III, IV CFTR mutants. The observed
  activities in YFP halide assays translated well to primary cells derived from
  CF lungs when measured using Trans-epithelial clamp circuit (TECC). Both
  potentiators improve F508del CFTR channel opening in a similar manner,
  increasing the open time and reducing the closed time of the channel. When
  evaluating the potentiators in a chronic setting on corrected F508del CFTR,
  no reduction of channel activity in presence of potentiator was observed. The
  current work identifies and characterizes novel CFTR potentiators GLPG1837
  and GLPG2451, which may offer new therapeutic options for CF patients.%

    Cystic fibrosis (CF) is caused by mutations in the gene for the cystic
  fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). With the discovery of
  Ivacaftor and Orkambi, it has been shown that CFTR function can be partially
  restored by administering one or more small molecules. These molecules aim at
  either enhancing the amount of CFTR on the cell surface (correctors) or at
  improving the gating function of the CFTR channel (potentiators). Here we
  describe the discovery of a novel potentiator GLPG1837, which shows enhanced
  efficacy on CFTR mutants harboring class III mutations compared to Ivacaftor,
  the first marketed potentiator. The optimization of potency, efficacy, and
  pharmacokinetic profile will be described.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    Identifying subjects with cystic fibrosis (CF) who may benefit from cystic
  fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR)-modulating drugs is
  time-consuming, costly, and especially challenging for individuals with rare
  uncharacterized CFTR mutations. We studied CFTR function and responses to two
  drugs - the prototypical CFTR potentiator VX-770 (ivacaftor/KALYDECO) and the
  CFTR corrector VX-809 (lumacaftor) - in organoid cultures derived from the
  rectal epithelia of subjects with CF, who expressed a broad range of CFTR
  mutations. We observed that CFTR residual function and responses to drug
  therapy depended on both the CFTR mutation and the genetic background of the
  subjects. In vitro drug responses in rectal organoids positively correlated
  with published outcome data from clinical trials with VX-809 and VX-770,
  allowing us to predict from preclinical data the potential for CF patients
  carrying rare CFTR mutations to respond to drug therapy. We demonstrated
  proof of principle by selecting two subjects expressing an uncharacterized
  rare CFTR genotype (G1249R/F508del) who showed clinical responses to
  treatment with ivacaftor and one subject (F508del/R347P) who showed a limited
  response to drug therapy both in vitro and in vivo. These data suggest that
  in vitro measurements of CFTR function in patient-derived rectal organoids
  may be useful for identifying subjects who would benefit from CFTR-correcting
  treatment, independent of their CFTR mutation.%

    Background: Current modulator therapies for some cystic fibrosis-causing
  CFTR mutants, including N1303K, have limited efficacy. We provide evidence
  here to support combination potentiator (co-potentiator) therapy for mutant
  CFTRs that are poorly responsive to single potentiators. Methods: Functional
  synergy screens done on N1303K and W1282X CFTR, in which small molecules were
  tested with VX-770, identified arylsulfonamide-pyrrolopyridine,
  phenoxy-benzimidazole and flavone co-potentiators. Results: A previously
  identified arylsulfonamide-pyrrolopyridine co-potentiator (ASP-11) added with
  VX-770 increased N1303K-CFTR current 7-fold more than VX-770 alone. ASP-11
  increased by {\~ }65\% of the current of G551D-CFTR compared to VX-770, was
  additive with VX-770 on F508del-CFTR, and activated wild-type CFTR in the
  absence of a cAMP agonist. ASP-11 efficacy with VX-770 was demonstrated in
  primary CF human airway cell cultures having N1303K, W1282X and G551D CFTR
  mutations. Structure-activity studies on 11 synthesized ASP-11 analogs
  produced compounds with EC 50 down to 0.5 {$\mu$}M. Conclusions: These
  studies support combination potentiator therapy for CF caused by some CFTR
  mutations that are not effectively treated by single potentiators.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    Available CFTR modulators provide no therapeutic benefit for cystic
  fibrosis (CF) caused by many loss-of-function mutations in the cystic
  fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) chloride channel,
  including N1303K. We previously introduced the concept of `co-potentiators'
  (combination-potentiators) to rescue CFTR function in some minimal function
  CFTR mutants. Herein, a screen of {\~ }120,000 drug-like synthetic small
  molecules identified active co-potentiators of pyrazoloquinoline,
  piperidine-pyridoindole, tetrahydroquinoline and phenylazepine classes, with
  EC50 down to {\~ }300 nM following initial structure-activity studies.
  Increased CFTR chloride conductance by up to 8-fold was observed when a
  co-potentiator (termed `Class II potentiator') was used with a classical
  potentiator (`Class I potentiator') such as VX-770 or GLPG1837. To
  investigate the range of CFTR mutations benefitted by co-potentiators, 14
  CF-associated CFTR mutations were studied in transfected cell models.
  Co-potentiator efficacy was found for CFTR missense, deletion and nonsense
  mutations in nucleotide binding domain-2 (NBD2), including W1282X, N1303K,
  c.3700A {$>$} G and Q1313X (with corrector for some mutations). In contrast,
  CFTR mutations G85E, R334W, R347P, V520F, R560T, A561E, M1101K and R1162X
  showed no co-potentiator activity, even with corrector. Co-potentiator
  efficacy was confirmed in primary human bronchial epithelial cell cultures
  generated from a N1303K homozygous CF subject. The Class II potentiators
  identified here may have clinical benefit for CF caused by mutations in the
  NBD2 domain of CFTR.%

    BACKGROUND: The potentiator ivacaftor (VX-770) has been approved for
  therapy of 38 cystic fibrosis (CF) mutations ({$\sim$}10\% of the patient
  population) associated with a gating defect of the CF transmembrane
  conductance regulator (CFTR). Despite the success of VX-770 treatment of
  patients carrying at least one allele of the most common gating mutation
  G551D-CFTR, some lung function decline and P. aeruginosa colonization
  persist. This study aims at identifying potentiator combinations that can
  considerably enhance the limited channel activity of a panel of CFTR gating
  mutants over monotherapy. METHODS: The functional response of 13 CFTR mutants
  to single potentiators or systematic potentiator combinations was determined
  in the human bronchial epithelial cell line CFBE41o- and a subset of them was
  confirmed in primary human nasal epithelia (HNE). RESULTS: In six out of
  thirteen CFTR missense mutants the fractional plasma membrane (PM) activity,
  a surrogate measure of CFTR channel gating, reached only {$\sim$}10-50\% of
  WT channel activity upon VX-770 treatment, indicating incomplete gating
  correction. Combinatorial potentiator profiling and cluster analysis of
  mutant responses to 24 diverse investigational potentiators identified
  several compound pairs that improved the gating activity of R352Q-, S549R-,
  S549N-, G551D-, and G1244E-CFTR to {$\sim$}70-120\% of the WT. Similarly, the
  potentiator combinations were able to confer WT-like function to G551D-CFTR
  in patient-derived human nasal epithelia. CONCLUSION: This study suggests
  that half of CF patients with missense mutations approved for VX-770
  administration, could benefit from the development of dual potentiator
  therapy.%

    Allostery is largely associated with conformational and functional
  transitions in individual proteins. This concept can be extended to consider
  the impact of conformational perturbations on cellular function and disease
  states. Here, we clarify the concept of allostery and how it controls
  physiological activities. We focus on the challenging questions of how
  allostery can both cause disease and contribute to development of new
  therapeutics. We aim to increase the awareness of the linkage between disease
  symptoms on the cellular level and specific aberrant allosteric actions on
  the molecular level and to emphasize the potential of allosteric drugs in
  innovative therapies. \textcopyright{} 2013 Elsevier Inc.%

    Background: The natural food supplements curcumin and genistein, and the
  drug ivacaftor were found effective as CFTR potentiators in the organoids of
  individuals carrying a S1251N gating mutation, possibly in a synergistic
  fashion. Based on these in vitro findings, we evaluated the clinical efficacy
  of a treatment with curcumin, genistein and ivacaftor, in different
  combinations. Methods: In three multi-center trials people with CF carrying
  the S1251N mutation were treated for 8 weeks with curcumin+genistein,
  ivacaftor and ivacaftor+genistein. We evaluated change in lung function,
  sweat chloride concentration, CFQ-r, BMI and fecal elastase to determine the
  clinical effect. We evaluated the pharmacokinetic properties of the compounds
  by evaluating the concentration in plasma collected after treatment and the
  effect of the same plasma on the intestinal organoids. Results: A clear
  clinical effect of treatment with ivacaftor was observed, evidenced by a
  significant improvement in clinical parameters. In contrast we observed no
  clear clinical effect of curcumin and/or genistein, except for a small but
  significant reduction in sweat chloride and airway resistance. Plasma
  concentrations of the food supplements were low, as was the response of the
  organoids to this plasma. Conclusions: We observed a clear clinical effect of
  treatment with ivacaftor, which is in line with the high responsiveness of
  the intestinal organoids to this drug. No clear clinical effect was observed
  of the treatment with curcumin and/or genistein, the low plasma concentration
  of these compounds emphasizes that pharmacokinetic properties of a compound
  have to be considered when in vitro experiments are performed.%

    Background: Ivacaftor, a cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance
  regulator (CFTR) potentiator, is approved for the treatment of patients with
  cystic fibrosis aged 6 years or older with Gly551Asp- CFTR. We assessed the
  safety and efficacy of ivacaftor during 96 weeks of PERSIST in patients with
  cystic fibrosis who completed a previous 48-week, placebo-controlled trial of
  the drug (STRIVE or ENVISION). Methods: In this phase 3, open-label extension
  study, patients received ivacaftor 150 mg every 12 h in addition to their
  prescribed cystic fibrosis therapies. Patients who received placebo in their
  previous study initiated ivacaftor in this extension study. Patients were
  eligible if they had a Gly551Asp-CFTR mutation on at least one allele. The
  primary objective was to assess the long-term safety profile of ivacaftor as
  assessed by adverse events, clinical laboratory assessments,
  electrocardiograms, vital signs, and physical examination; secondary measures
  included change in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), weight, and
  pulmonary exacerbations. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov,
  number NCT01117012 and EudraCT, number 2009-012997-11. Findings: Between July
  8, 2010, and April 8, 2013, 144 adolescents/adults ({$\geq$}12 years) from
  STRIVE and 48 children (6-11 years) from ENVISION were enrolled. Across both
  trials, 38 (20\%) patients had a serious adverse event during the first 48
  weeks and 44 (23\%) during the subsequent 48 weeks. Two adults (1\%) and one
  child ({$<$}1\%) discontinued because of adverse events. The most common
  adverse events were pulmonary exacerbation, cough, and upper respiratory
  tract infection. Patients previously treated with ivacaftor had sustained
  improvements in FEV1, weight, and rate of pulmonary exacerbations for up to
  144 weeks of treatment. Among adolescents/adults and children who previously
  received ivacaftor, absolute change in FEV1 at week 96 (144 weeks ivacaftor)
  was 9\textperiodcentered 4 and 10\textperiodcentered 3 \% points and absolute
  increase in weight was 4\textperiodcentered 1 kg and 14\textperiodcentered 8
  kg, respectively. For adolescents/adults only, the pulmonary exacerbation
  rate remained suppressed compared with that of patients who received placebo
  in the placebo-controlled study. Interpretation: At 144 weeks of treatment,
  ivacaftor was well tolerated, with no new safety concerns. Ivacaftor also
  provided durable effects for 144 weeks in patients who had received active
  treatment in the placebo-controlled study. Those patients who previously
  received placebo had improvements comparable to those of patients treated
  with ivacaftor in the placebo-controlled study. Funding: Vertex

    Background: Ivacaftor is the first in a class of drugs, CFTR modulators,
  that target the underlying defect in cystic fibrosis (CF). This long-term
  observational safety study evaluated CF disease progression in patients
  treated with ivacaftor in a real-world setting for up to 5 years. Methods:
  Data from existing US and UK CF patient registries were used to assess
  longitudinal patterns in lung function, nutritional status, pulmonary
  exacerbations and hospitalizations, CF-related diabetes (CFRD), and
  Pseudomonas aeruginosa in ivacaftor-treated vs untreated comparator cohorts
  matched by age, sex, and disease severity. Results: US analyses included 635
  ivacaftor-treated patients and 1874 comparators followed for 5 years from
  year 1 of market availability (2012\textendash 2016). Evaluation of outcome
  patterns from pretreatment baseline (2011) through year 5 (2016), showed that
  relative to comparators, ivacaftor-treated patients had better preserved lung
  function (mean change in percent predicted FEV1, -0.7 percentage points with
  ivacaftor vs -8.3 percentage points in comparators) and improved nutritional
  status (mean body mass index change +2.4 kg/m2 with ivacaftor vs +1.6 kg/m2
  in comparators). US patients treated with ivacaftor had significantly lower
  frequencies of exacerbations and hospitalizations in each of the 5 years of
  follow-up relative to pretreatment baseline and comparators. Favorable trends
  in CFRD and P. aeruginosa prevalence were also observed. Findings from the
  smaller UK registry were directionally similar to and consistent with US
  findings. Conclusions: This observational study represents the largest
  longitudinal analysis of patients treated with ivacaftor in a real-world
  setting. The findings support disease modification by CFTR modulation with
  ivacaftor.%

    Genistein and curcumin are major components of Asian foods, soybean and
  curry turmeric respectively. These compounds have been intensively
  investigated for their chemical and biological features conferring their
  anti-cancer activity. Genistein and curcumin have also been investigated for
  their potentiation effects on disease-associated CFTR mutants such as
  {$\Delta$}F508 and G551D. Recently, we investigated the combined effect of
  genistein and curcumin on G551D-CFTR, which exhibits gating defects without
  abnormalities in protein synthesis or trafficking using the patch-clamp
  technique. We found that genistein and curcumin showed additive effects on
  their potentiation of G551D-CFTR in high concentration range and also, more
  importantly, showed a significant synergistic effect in their minimum
  concentration ranges. These results are consistent with the idea that
  multiple mechanisms are involved in the action of these CFTR potentiators. In
  this review, we revisit the pharmacology of genistein and curcumin on CFTR
  and also propose new pharmaceutical implications of combined use of these
  compounds in the development of drugs for CF pharmacotherapy.%

    \textcopyright{} 2018 Massachusetts Medical Society. Background: VX-445 is
  a next-generation cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR)
  corrector designed to restore Phe508del CFTR protein function in patients
  with cystic fibrosis when administered with tezacaftor and ivacaftor
  (VX-445-tezacaftor-ivacaftor). Methods: We evaluated the effects of
  VX-445-tezacaftor-ivacaftor on Phe508del CFTR protein processing,
  trafficking, and chloride transport in human bronchial epithelial cells. On
  the basis of in vitro activity, a randomized, placebo-controlled,
  double-blind, dose-ranging, phase 2 trial was conducted to evaluate oral
  VX-445-tezacaftor-ivacaftor in patients heterozygous for the Phe508del CFTR
  mutation and a minimal-function mutation (Phe508del- MF) and in patients
  homozygous for the Phe508del CFTR mutation (Phe508del-Phe508del) after
  tezacaftor-ivacaftor run-in. Primary end points were safety and absolute
  change in percentage of predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1)
  from baseline. Results: In vitro, VX-445-tezacaftor-ivacaftor significantly
  improved Phe508del CFTR protein processing, trafficking, and chloride
  transport to a greater extent than any two of these agents in dual
  combination. In patients with cystic fibrosis, VX-445-tezacaftor-ivacaftor
  had an acceptable safety and side-effect profile. Most adverse events were
  mild or moderate. The treatment also resulted in an increased percentage of
  predicted FEV1 of up to 13.8 points in the Phe508del-MF group (P{$<$}0.001).
  In patients in the Phe508del-Phe508del group, who were already receiving
  tezacaftor-ivacaftor, the addition of VX-445 resulted in an 11.0-point
  increase in the percentage of predicted FEV1 (P{$<$}0.001). In both groups,
  there was a decrease in sweat chloride concentrations and improvement in the
  respiratory domain score on the Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire-Revised.
  Conclusions: The use of VX-445-tezacaftor-ivacaftor to target Phe508del CFTR
  protein resulted in increased CFTR function in vitro and translated to
  improvements in patients with cystic fibrosis with one or two Phe508del
  alleles. This approach has the potential to treat the underlying cause of
  cystic fibrosis in approximately 90\% of patients.%

    Based on its clinical benefits, Trikafta - the combination of folding
  correctors VX-661 (tezacaftor), VX-445 (elexacaftor), and the gating
  potentiator VX-770 (ivacaftor) - was FDA approved for treatment of patients
  with cystic fibrosis (CF) carrying deletion of phenylalanine at position 508
  (F508del) of the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) on at least 1
  allele. Neither the mechanism of action of VX-445 nor the susceptibility of
  rare CF folding mutants to Trikafta are known. Here, we show that, in human
  bronchial epithelial cells, VX-445 synergistically restores F508del-CFTR
  processing in combination with type I or II correctors that target the
  nucleotide binding domain 1 (NBD1) membrane spanning domains (MSDs) interface
  and NBD2, respectively, consistent with a type III corrector mechanism. This
  inference was supported by the VX-445 binding to and unfolding suppression of
  the isolated F508del-NBD1 of CFTR. The VX-661 plus VX-445 treatment restored
  F508del-CFTR chloride channel function in the presence of VX-770 to
  approximately 62\% of WT CFTR in homozygous nasal epithelia. Substantial
  rescue of rare misprocessing mutations (S13F, R31C, G85E, E92K, V520F,
  M1101K, and N1303K), confined to MSD1, MSD2, NBD1, and NBD2 of CFTR, was also
  observed in airway epithelia, suggesting an allosteric correction mechanism
  and the possible application of Trikafta for patients with rare misfolding
  mutants of CFTR.%

    Trikafta, the combination of elexacaftor (VX-445), tezacaftor (VX-661) and
  ivacaftor (VX-770), was approved for therapy of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients
  with at least one allele of the CFTR mutation F508del. While the corrector
  function of VX-445 is well established, here we investigated the putative
  potentiator activity of VX-445 alone and in combination with VX-770. Acute
  addition of VX-445 increased the VX-770-potentiated F508del- and G551D-CFTR
  current by {\~ }24\% and {$>$}70\%, respectively, in human bronchial and
  nasal epithelia. Combinatorial profiling and cluster analysis of G551D- and
  G1244E-CFTR channel activation with potentiator pairs indicated a distinct
  VX-445 mechanism of action that is, at least, additive to previously
  identified potentiator classes, including the VX-770. Since VX-770 only
  partially normalizes the G551D-CFTR channel function and adult G551D patients
  still experience progressive loss of lung function, VX-445+VX-770 combination
  therapy could provide clinical benefit to CF patients with the G551D and
  other dual potentiator responsive mutants.%

    Protein misfolding is involved in a large number of diseases, among which
  cystic fibrosis. Complex intra- and inter-domain folding defects associated
  with mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR) gene,
  among which p.Phe508del (F508del), have recently become a therapeutical
  target. Clinically approved correctors such as VX-809, VX-661, and VX-445,
  rescue mutant protein. However, their binding sites and mechanisms of action
  are still incompletely understood. Blind docking onto the 3D structures of
  both the first membrane-spanning domain (MSD1) and the first
  nucleotide-binding domain (NBD1), followed by molecular dynamics simulations,
  revealed the presence of two potential VX-809 corrector binding sites which,
  when mutated, abrogated rescue. Network of amino acids in the lasso helix 2
  and the intracellular loops ICL1 and ICL4 allosterically coupled MSD1 and
  NBD1. Corrector VX-445 also occupied two potential binding sites on MSD1 and
  NBD1, the latter being shared with VX-809. Binding of both correctors on MSD1
  enhanced the allostery between MSD1 and NBD1, hence the increased efficacy of
  the corrector combination. These correctors improve both intra-domain folding
  by stabilizing fragile protein\textendash lipid interfaces and inter-domain
  assembly via distant allosteric couplings. These results provide novel
  mechanistic insights into the rescue of misfolded proteins by small
  molecules.%

    OBJECTIVES: The aim was to present the workup of patients with acute
  recurrent pancreatitis (ARP) for genetic analysis and electrophysiological
  testing. METHODS: Patients with ARP with unknown etiology were referred for
  genetic testing and evaluation of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductor
  regulator (CFTR) function by nasal potential difference (NPD) testing.
  RESULTS: A total of 67 patients were evaluated. The mean age was 23 {$\pm$}
  17 years (median 17.0 years, range 1.5-72 years); 90\% were Jewish and 10\%
  Arab. Ten (15\%) patients carried PRSS1 gene mutation (K23R(7), R122H(2), and
  D21A(1)). One patient had K172E/- (chymotrypsin C [CTRC]) mutation, 1 had
  I42M (serine protease inhibitor Kazal type 1 [SPINK1])/V235I (CTRC) together
  with {$\Delta$}F508/5T, 1 patient had R67H (SPINK1)/V235I (CTRC), and 1
  patient had V235I (CTRC)/-. Ten of 67 (15\%) patients submitted for CFTR gene
  testing carried mutations ({$\Delta$}F508/L997F, {$\Delta$}F508/5T(11TG),
  W1282/5T(12TG), W1282X/Y1014C, {$\Delta$}F508/R31C, R117H/-, R117H/Y1014C,
  D1152H/-, 5T(11TG)/-, and L997F/-). Fifty-four (80\%) patients underwent
  sweat testing. Of these, 5 had sweat chloride {$\geq$}60 mEq/L, and 22
  patients had sweat chloride from 40 to 60 mEq/L. Of the 56 (83\%) patients
  had nasal potential difference testing, 4 (6\%) with abnormal results.
  CONCLUSIONS: One-third (34\%) of patients with ARP carry mutations for
  hereditary pancreatitis including rare mutations (K23R), and 12.5\% have
  evidence of cftr mutations and 10\% had CFTR dysfunction underscoring the
  importance of genetic and functional workup of these patients.%

    ABC transporters transport a wealth of molecules across membranes and
  consist of transmembrane and cytosolic domains. Their activity cycle involves
  a tightly regulated and concerted domain choreography. Regulation is driven
  by the cytosolic domains and function by the transmembrane domains. Folding
  of these polytopic multidomain proteins to their functional state is a
  challenge for cells, which is mitigated by co-translational and sequential
  events. We here reveal the first stages of co-translational domain folding
  and assembly of CFTR, the ABC transporter defective in the most abundant rare
  inherited disease cystic fibrosis. We have combined biosynthetic
  radiolabeling with protease-susceptibility assays and domain-specific
  antibodies. The most N-terminal domain, TMD1 (transmembrane domain 1), folds
  both its hydrophobic and soluble helices during translation: the
  transmembrane helices pack tightly and the cytosolic N- and C-termini
  assemble with the first cytosolic helical loop ICL1, leaving only ICL2
  exposed. This N-C-ICL1 assembly is strengthened by two independent events:
  (i) assembly of ICL1 with the N-terminal subdomain of the next domain,
  cytosolic NBD1 (nucleotide-binding domain 1); and (ii) in the presence of
  corrector drug VX-809, which rescues cell-surface expression of a range of
  disease-causing CFTR mutants. Both lead to increased shielding of the CFTR
  N-terminus, and their additivity implies different modes of action. Early
  assembly of NBD1 and TMD1 is essential for CFTR folding and positions both
  domains for the required assembly with TMD2. Altogether, we have gained
  insights into this first, nucleating, VX-809-enhanced domain-assembly event
  during and immediately after CFTR translation, involving structures conserved
  in type-I ABC exporters.%

    Intestinal current measurements (ICM) on rectal suction biopsies are a tool
  for the ex vivo diagnosis of classical and atypical cystic fibrosis (CF). We
  present the basic ICM protocol, typical tracings and their interpretation.
  The ICM technique allows the registration of CF-induced changes in
  electrogenic transepithelial ion transport (Cl-, HCO3-, K+) in a Cl-
  secretory epithelium, and on the basis of pharmacological criteria, is able
  to discriminate between CFTR-mediated Cl- secretion and secretion through
  alternative anion channels. ICM is particularly useful for the classification
  of individuals with CF-like clinical features with equivocal sweat test
  values and/or no or one identifiable CFTR mutation. \textcopyright{} 2004

    Background: In questionable cystic fibrosis (CF), mild or monosymptomatic
  phenotypes frequently cause diagnostic difficulties despite detailed
  algorithms. CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR)-mediated ion
  transport can be studied ex vivo in rectal biopsies by intestinal current
  measurement (ICM). Objectives: To describe reference values and validate ICM
  for the diagnostic classification of questionable CF at all patient ages.
  Methods: ICM was performed in 309 rectal biopsies from 130 infants, children
  and adults including patients with known pancreatic-insufficient (PI)-CF
  (n=34), pancreatic-sufficient (PS)-CF (n=7), patients with an unclear
  diagnosis with mild CF symptoms, intermediate sweat test and/or CFTR mutation
  screening (n=61) and healthy controls (n=28). ICM was correlated to sweat
  chloride, extensive CFTR genotype and transcript analysis in the diagnostic
  group. The results were compared with previous ICM data in subjects with CF,
  congenital bilateral absence of the vas deferens, heterozygotes and controls.
  Results: The cumulative chloride secretory response of
  {$\Delta$}Isc,carbachol, {$\Delta$}I sc,cAMP/forskolin and
  {$\Delta$}Isc,histamine was the best diagnostic ICM parameter (cut-off 34
  {$\mu$}A/cm2 between patients with known PS-CF and controls), differentiating
  patients with questionable CF into PS-CF (n=6) and 'CF unlikely' (n=55)
  groups. Extensive genotype analysis detected two mutations (40\%
  disease-causing) in 100\% of individuals classified as PS-CF compared with
  1.8\% in those classified as 'CF unlikely'. Conclusions: This comprehensive
  investigation of CFTR function and genotype underlines the diagnostic value
  of ICM, especially for confirmation of CF in the absence of two
  disease-causing CFTR mutations, exclusion of CF despite intermediate sweat
  test and age groups unsuitable for nasal potential difference measurements.
  ICM is an important tool for functional assessment in CFTR mutations of
  unknown clinical relevance.%

    Deletion of phenylalanine 508 of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane
  conductance regulator ({$\Delta$}F508 CFTR) is the major cause of cystic
  fibrosis, one of the most common inherited childhood diseases. The mutated
  CFTR anion channel is not fully glycosylated and shows minimal activity in
  bronchial epithelial cells of patients with cystic fibrosis. Low temperature
  or inhibition of histone deacetylases can partly rescue {$\Delta$}F508 CFTR
  cellular processing defects and function. A favourable change of
  {$\Delta$}F508 CFTR protein-protein interactions was proposed as a mechanism
  of rescue; however, CFTR interactome dynamics during temperature shift and
  inhibition of histone deacetylases are unknown. Here we report the first
  comprehensive analysis of the CFTR and {$\Delta$}F508 CFTR interactome and
  its dynamics during temperature shift and inhibition of histone deacetylases.
  By using a novel deep proteomic analysis method, we identify 638 individual
  high-confidence CFTR interactors and discover a {$\Delta$}F508
  deletion-specific interactome, which is extensively remodelled upon rescue.
  Detailed analysis of the interactome remodelling identifies key novel
  interactors, whose loss promote {$\Delta$}F508 CFTR channel function in
  primary cystic fibrosis epithelia or which are critical for CFTR biogenesis.
  Our results demonstrate that global remodelling of {$\Delta$}F508 CFTR
  interactions is crucial for rescue, and provide comprehensive insight into
  the molecular disease mechanisms of cystic fibrosis caused by deletion of
  F508.%

    Molecular dynamics simulations of five water models, the TIP3P (original

  carried out in the microcanonical NVE ensemble, using 901 water molecules in
  a cubic simulation cell furnished with periodic boundary conditions at 298 K.
  The SHAKE algorithm was used to keep water molecules rigid. Nanosecond
  trajectories were calculated with all water models for high statistical
  accuracy. The characteristic self-diffusion coefficients D and radial
  distribution functions, gOO, gOH, and gHH for all five water models were

  rescaling on the self-diffusion coefficient D were examined. All these
  empirical water models used in this study are similar by having three
  interaction sites, but the small differences in their pair potentials
  composed of Lennard-Jones (LJ) and Coulombic terms give significant
  differences in the calculated self-diffusion coefficients, and in the height
  of the second peak of the radial distribution function gOO.%

    Intrinsically disordered proteins play crucial roles in regulatory
  processes and often function as protein interaction hubs. Here, we present a
  detailed characterization of a full-length disordered hub protein region
  involved in multiple dynamic complexes. We performed NMR, CD, and
  fluorescence binding studies on the nonphosphorylated and highly
  PKA-phosphorylated human cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator
  (CFTR) regulatory region, a {$\sim$}200-residue disordered segment involved
  in phosphorylation- dependent regulation of channel trafficking and gating.
  Our data provide evidence for dynamic, phosphorylation-dependent, multisite
  interactions of various segments of the regulatory region for its intra- and
  intermolecular partners, including the CFTR nucleotide binding domains 1 and
  2, a 42-residue peptide from the C terminus of CFTR, the SLC26A3 sulphate
  transporter and antisigma factor antagonist (STAS) domain, and
  14-3-3{$\beta$}. Because of its large number of binding partners, multivalent
  binding of individually weak sites facilitates rapid exchange between free
  and bound states to allow the regulatory region to engage with different
  partners and generate a graded or rheostat-like response to phosphorylation.
  Our results enrich the understanding of how disordered binding segments
  interact with multiple targets. We present structural models consistent with
  our data that illustrate this dynamic aspect of phospho-regulation of CFTR by
  the disordered regulatory region.%

    Technical aspects of the constant pressure molecular dynamics (MD) method
  proposed by Andersen and extended by Parrinello and Rahman to allow changes

  Results on the conservation laws, the frequency of oscillation of the MD

    A significant modification to the additive all-atom CHARMM lipid force
  field (FF) is developed and applied to phospholipid bilayers with both
  choline and ethanolamine containing head groups and with both saturated and
  unsaturated aliphatic chains. Motivated by the current CHARMM lipid FF (C27
  and C27r) systematically yielding values of the surface area per lipid that
  are smaller than experimental estimates and gel-like structures of bilayers
  well above the gel transition temperature, selected torsional, Lennard-Jones
  and partial atomic charge parameters were modified by targeting both quantum
  mechanical (QM) and experimental data. QM calculations ranging from
  high-level ab initio calculations on small molecules to semiempirical QM
  studies on a 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-phosphatidylcholine (DPPC) bilayer in
  combination with experimental thermodynamic data were used as target data for
  parameter optimization. These changes were tested with simulations of pure
  bilayers at high hydration of the following six lipids: DPPC,
  1,2-dimyristoyl-sn- phosphatidylcholine (DMPC),
  1,2-dilauroyl-sn-phosphatidylcholine (DLPC),
  1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-phosphatidylcholine (POPC), 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-
  phosphatidylcholine (DOPC), and
  1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-phosphatidylethanolamine (POPE); simulations of a low
  hydration DOPC bilayer were also performed. Agreement with experimental
  surface area is on average within 2\%, and the density profiles agree well
  with neutron and X-ray diffraction experiments. NMR deuterium order
  parameters (SCD) are well predicted with the new FF, including proper
  splitting of the SCD for the aliphatic carbon adjacent to the carbonyl for
  DPPC, POPE, and POPC bilayers. The area compressibility modulus and frequency
  dependence of 13C NMR relaxation rates of DPPC and the water distribution of
  low hydration DOPC bilayers also agree well with experiment. Accordingly, the
  presented lipid FF, referred to as C36, allows for molecular dynamics
  simulations to be run in the tensionless ensemble (NPT), and is anticipated
  to be of utility for simulations of pure lipid systems as well as
  heterogeneous systems including membrane proteins. \textcopyright{} 2010

    Atomistic level molecular dynamics can provide insights into the structure,
  dynamics and thermodynamic stability of lipid membranes and of localized
  aft-like regions in membranes. However the challenges in the construction and
  simulation of accurate models of heterogeneous membranes are great. In this
  chapter we outline the steps needed to carry out and analyze atomistic
  simulations of hydrated lipid bilayers. While molecular dynamics s a method
  that is simple in its conceptual content, there are many subtle challenges
  that must be addressed in the construction of a simulation f a lipid bilayer
  in water. These include simulation algorithms, forcefields, boundary
  conditions, equilibration and others. We will discuss all of the basic
  requirements for the construction and running of a molecular dynamics
  simulation of a lipid bilayer. We then discuss how one analyzes the data
  presented by a simulation, in terms of experimental results and detailed
  structural and dynamical predictions of the simulation. In the final part of
  the chapter we show how the data from a molecular dynamics simulation can be
  sed to construct a coarse grained model for the heterogeneous bilayer that
  can predict the lateral organization and stability of rafts at up to
  millisecond timescales.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    When studying biological membranes, Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations
  reveal to be quite complementary to experimental techniques. Because the
  simulated systems keep increasing both in size and complexity, the analysis
  of MD trajectories need to be computationally efficient while being robust
  enough to perform analysis on membranes that may be curved or deformed due to
  their size and/or protein-lipid interactions. This work presents a new
  software named FATSLiM ('Fast Analysis Toolbox for Simulations of Lipid
  Membranes') that can extract physical properties from MD simulations of
  membranes (with or without interacting proteins). Because it relies on the
  calculation of local normals, FATSLiM does not depend of the bilayer
  morphology and thus can handle with the same accuracy vesicles for instance.
  Thanks to an efficiency-driven development, it is also fast and consumes a
  rather low amount of memory.%

    The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR)
  Cl\textendash{} channel contains 12 transmembrane (TM) regions that are
  presumed to form the channel pore. However, little is known about the
  relative functional contribution of different TM regions to the pore. We have
  used patch clamp recording to investigate the functional consequences of
  point mutations throughout the six transmembrane regions in the N-terminal
  part of the CFTR protein (TM1-TM6). A range of specific functional assays
  compared the single channel conductance, anion binding, and anion selectivity
  properties of different channel variants. Overall, our results suggest that
  TM1 and -6 play dominant roles in forming the channel pore and determining
  its functional properties, with TM5 perhaps playing a lesser role. In
  contrast, TM2, -3, and -4 appear to play only minor supporting roles. These
  results define transmembrane regions 1 and 6 as major contributors to the
  CFTR channel pore and have strong implications for emerging structural models
  of CFTR and related ATP-binding cassette proteins.%

    Multi-ion pore behaviour has been identified in many Cl- channel types but

  associated with drastically reduced single channel conductance. These results
  are consistent with models suggesting that rapid Cl- permeation in CFTR

  concurrently inside the pore. Naturally occurring mutations that disrupt
  these interactions can result in cystic fibrosis.%

    Ligand-gated ion channels conduct currents in response to chemical stimuli,
  mediating electrochemical signaling in neurons and other excitable cells. For
  many channels, the details of gating remain unclear, partly due to limited
  structural data and simulation timescales. Here, we used enhanced sampling to
  simulate the pH-gated channel GLIC, and construct Markov state models (MSMs)
  of gating. Consistent with new functional recordings, we report in oocytes,
  our analysis revealed differential effects of protonation and mutation on
  free-energy wells. Clustering of closed- versus open-like states enabled
  estimation of open probabilities and transition rates, while higher-order
  clustering affirmed conformational trends in gating. Furthermore, our models
  uncovered state- and protonation-dependent symmetrization. This demonstrates
  the applicability of MSMs to map energetic and conformational transitions
  between ion-channel functional states, and how they reproduce shifts upon
  activation or mutation, with implications for modeling neuronal function and
  developing state-selective drugs.%

    The phosphorylation-activated anion channel cystic fibrosis transmembrane
  conductance regulator (CFTR) is gated by an ATP hydrolysis cycle at its two
  cytosolic nucleotide-binding domains, and is essential for epithelial
  salt-water transport. A large number of CFTR mutations cause cystic fibrosis.
  Since recent breakthrough in targeted pharmacotherapy, CFTR mutants with
  impaired gating are candidates for stimulation by potentiator drugs. Thus,
  understanding the molecular pathology of individual mutations has become
  important. The relatively common R117H mutation affects an extracellular
  loop, but nevertheless causes a strong gating defect. Here, we identify a
  hydrogen bond between the side chain of arginine 117 and the backbone
  carbonyl group of glutamate 1124 in the cryo-electronmicroscopic structure of
  phosphorylated, ATP-bound CFTR. We address the functional relevance of that
  interaction for CFTR gating using macroscopic and microscopic inside-out
  patch-clamp recordings. Employing thermodynamic double-mutant cycles, we
  systematically track gating-state-dependent changes in the strength of the
  R117-E1124 interaction. We find that the H-bond is formed only in the open
  state, but neither in the short-lived `flickery' nor in the long-lived
  `interburst' closed state. Loss of this H-bond explains the strong gating
  phenotype of the R117H mutant, including robustly shortened burst durations
  and strongly reduced intraburst open probability. The findings may help
  targeted potentiator design.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) chloride
  channel is activated by ATP binding-induced dimerization of
  nucleotide-binding domains, the interaction between the phosphorylated
  regulatory (R) domain and the curcumin-sensitive interface between
  intracellular loop (ICL) 1 and ICL4, and the resultant inward-to-`outward'
  reorientation of transmembrane domains. Although transmembrane helices (TM) 2
  and TM11 link the ICL1\textendash ICL4 interface with the interface between
  extracellular loop (ECL) 1 and ECL6, it is unknown whether both interfaces
  are gating-coupled during the reorientation. Herein, R334C and T1122C
  mutations were used to engineer two Zn2+ bridges near and at the
  ECL1\textendash ECL6 interface, respectively, and the gating effects of a
  Zn2+ disturbance at the ECL1\textendash ECL6 interface on the stimulatory
  ICL1/ICL4-R interaction were determined. The results showed that both Zn2+
  bridges inhibited channel activity in a dose- and Cl--dependent manner, and
  the inhibition was reversed by a washout or suppressed by thiol-specific
  modification. Interestingly, their Cl--dependent Zn2+ inhibition was weakened
  at higher Zn2+ concentrations, their Zn2+ affinity was stronger in the
  resting state than in the activated state, and their activation current
  noises were decreased by external Zn2+ binding. More importantly, the
  external Zn2+ inhibition was reversed by internal curcumin in the R334C
  construct but not in the T1122C mutant. Therefore, although both Zn2+ bridges
  may promote channel closure, external Zn2+ may disturb the ECL1\textendash
  ECL6 interface and thus prevent the stimulatory ICL1/ICL4-R interaction and
  curcumin potentiation via a gating coupling between these two interfaces.%

    Studies have shown that expression of cystic fibrosis transmembrane
  conductance regulator (CFTR) is associated with enhanced glutathione (GSH)
  efflux from airway epithelial cells, implicating a role for CFTR in the
  control of oxidative stress in the airways. To define the mechanism
  underlying CFTR-associated GSH flux, we studied wild-type and mutant CFTR
  proteins expressed in Sf9 membranes, as well as purified and reconstituted
  CFTR. We show that CFTR-expressing membrane vesicles mediate
  nucleotide-activated GSH flux, which is disrupted in the R347D pore mutant,
  and in the Walker A K464A and K1250A mutants. Further, we reveal that
  purified CFTR protein alone directly mediates nucleotide-dependent GSH flux.
  Interestingly, although ATP supports GSH flux through CFTR, this activity is
  enhanced in the presence of the non-hydrolyzable ATP analog AMP-PNP. These
  findings corroborate previous suggestions that CFTR pore properties can vary
  with the nature of the nucleotide interaction. In conclusion, our data
  demonstrate that GSH flux is an intrinsic function of CFTR and prompt future
  examination of the role of this function in airway biology in health and
  disease.%

    The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is an ion
  channel that regulates the flow of anions across epithelia. Mutations in CFTR
  cause cystic fibrosis. CFTR belongs to the ATP-binding cassette transporter
  superfamily, and gating is controlled by phosphorylation and ATP binding and
  hydrolysis. Recently obtained ATP-free and ATP-bound structures of zebrafish
  CFTR revealed an unwound segment of transmembrane helix (TM) 8, which appears
  to be a unique feature of CFTR not present in other ATP-binding cassette
  transporter structures. Here, using {$\mu$}s-long molecular dynamics
  simulations, we investigate the interactions formed by this TM8 segment with
  nearby helices in both ATP-free and ATP-bound states. We highlight
  ATP-dependent interactions as well as the structural role of TM8 in
  maintaining the functional architecture of the pore via interactions common
  to both the ATP-bound and ATP-free state. The results of the molecular
  dynamics simulations are discussed in the context of the gating mechanism of
  CFTR.%

    Experimental and computational studies have painted a picture of the
  chloride permeation pathway in cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance
  regulator (CFTR) as a short narrow tunnel flanked by wider inner and outer
  vestibules. Although these studies also identified a number of transmembrane
  segments (TMs) as porelining, the exact location of CFTR's gate(s) remains
  unknown. Here, using a channel-permeant probe, [Au(CN)2]-, we provide
  evidence that CFTR bears a gate that coincides with the predicted narrow
  section of the pore defined as residues 338-341 in TM6. Specifically,
  cysteines introduced cytoplasmic to the narrow region (i.e., positions 344 in
  TM6 and 1148 in TM12) can be modified by intracellular [Au(CN)2]-, in both
  open and closed states, corroborating the conclusion that the internal
  vestibule does not harbor a gate. However, cysteines engineered to positions
  external to the presumed narrow region (e.g., 334, 335, and 337 in TM6) are
  all nonreactive toward cytoplasmic [Au(CN)2]-, in the absence of ATP, whereas
  they can be better accessed by extracellular [Au(CN)2]-, when the open
  probability ismarkedly reduced by introducing a second mutation, G1349D. As
  [Au(CN)2]-, and chloride ions share the same permeation pathway, these
  results imply a gate is situated between amino acid residues 337 and 344
  along TM6, encompassing the very segment that may also serve as the
  selectivity filter for CFTR. The unique position of a gate in the middle of
  the ion translocation pathway diverges from those seen in ATP-binding
  cassette (ABC) transporters and thus distinguishes CFTR from other members of
  the ABC transporter family.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    ABC (ATP-binding cassette) proteins constitute a large family of membrane
  proteins that actively transport a broad range of substrates. Cystic fibrosis
  transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), the protein dysfunctional in
  cystic fibrosis, is unique among ABC proteins in that its transmembrane
  domains comprise an ion channel. Opening and closing of the pore have been
  linked to ATP binding and hydrolysis at CFTR's two nucleotide-binding
  domains, NBD1 and NBD2 (see, for example, refs 1, 2). Isolated NBDs of
  prokaryotic ABC proteins dimerize upon binding ATP, and hydrolysis of the ATP
  causes dimer dissociation3,4,5. Here, using single-channel recording methods
  on intact CFTR molecules, we directly follow opening and closing of the
  channel gates, and relate these occurrences to ATP-mediated events in the
  NBDs. We find that energetic coupling6 between two CFTR residues, expected to
  lie on opposite sides of its predicted NBD1\textendash NBD2 dimer interface,
  changes in concert with channel gating status. The two monitored side chains
  are independent of each other in closed channels but become coupled as the
  channels open. The results directly link ATP-driven tight dimerization of
  CFTR's cytoplasmic nucleotide-binding domains to opening of the ion channel
  in the transmembrane domains. This establishes a molecular mechanism,
  involving dynamic restructuring of the NBD dimer interface, that is probably
  common to all members of the ABC protein superfamily.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    Opening of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR)
  channel is coupled to the motion of its two nucleotide-binding domains: they
  form a heterodimer sandwiching two functionally distinct ATP-binding sites
  (sites 1 and 2). While active ATP hydrolysis in site 2 triggers rapid channel
  closure, the functional role of stable ATP binding in the
  catalysis-incompetent (or degenerate) site 1, a feature conserved in many
  other ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter proteins, remains elusive. Here,
  we found that CFTR loses its prompt responsiveness to ATP after the channel
  is devoid of ATP for tens to hundreds of seconds. Mutants with weakened ATP
  binding in site 1 and the most prevalent disease-causing mutation, F508del,
  are more vulnerable to ATP depletion. In contrast, strengthening ligand
  binding in site 1 with N6-(2-phenylethyl)-ATP, a high-affinity ATP analogue,
  or abolishing ATP hydrolysis in site 2 by the mutation D1370N, helps sustain
  a durable function of the otherwise unstable mutant channels. Thus, tight
  binding of ATP in the degenerate ATP-binding site is crucial to the
  functional stability of CFTR. Small molecules targeting site 1 may bear
  therapeutic potential to overcome the membrane instability of F508del-CFTR.
  Key points During evolution, many ATP-binding cassette transporters
  \textendash{} including the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance
  regulator (CFTR) chloride channel, whose dysfunction causes cystic fibrosis
  (CF) \textendash{} lose the ability to hydrolyse ATP in one of the two
  ATP-binding sites. Here we show that tight ATP binding at this degenerate
  site in CFTR is central for maintaining the stable, robust function of normal
  CFTR. We also demonstrate that membrane instability of the most common
  CF-causing mutant, F508del-CFTR, can be rescued by strengthening ATP binding
  at CFTR's degenerate site. Our data thus explain an evolutionary puzzle and
  offer a potential therapeutic strategy for CF.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    CFTR is unique among ABC transporters as the only one functioning as an ion
  channel and from a human health perspective because mutations in its gene
  cause cystic fibrosis. Although considerable advances have been made towards
  understanding CFTR's mechanism of action and the impact of mutations, the
  lack of a high-resolution 3D structure has hindered progress. The large
  multi-domain membrane glycoprotein is normally present at low copy number and
  when over expressed at high levels it aggregates strongly, limiting the
  production of stable mono-disperse preparations. While the reasons for the
  strong self-association are not fully understood, its relatively low thermal
  stability seems likely to be one. The major CF causing mutation,
  {$\Delta$}F508, renders the protein very thermally unstable and therefore a
  great deal of attention has been paid to this property of CFTR. Multiple
  second site mutations of CFTR in NBD1 where F508 normally resides and small
  molecule binders of the domain increase the thermal stability of the mutant.
  These manipulations also stabilize the wild-type protein. Here we have
  applied {$\Delta$}F508-stabilizing changes and other modifications to
  generate wild-type constructs that express at much higher levels in scaled-up
  suspension cultures of mammalian cells. After purification and reconstitution
  into liposomes these proteins are active in a locked-open conformation at
  temperatures as high as 50\textdegree C and remain monodisperse at
  4\textdegree C in detergent or lipid for at least a week. The availability of
  adequate amounts of these and related stable active preparations of
  homogeneous CFTR will enable stalled structural and ligand binding studies to
  proceed.%

    The devastating inherited disease cystic fibrosis (CF) is caused by
  mutations of the Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (CFTR)
  anion channel. The recent approval of the CFTR potentiator drug ivacaftor
  (Vx-770) for the treatment of CF patients has marked the advent of causative
  CF therapy. Currently, thousands of patients are being treated with the drug,
  and its molecular mechanism of action is under intensive investigation. Here
  we determine the solubility profile and true stimulatory potency of Vx-770
  towards wild-type (WT) and mutant human CFTR channels in cell-free patches of
  membrane. We find that its aqueous solubility is {$\sim$}200 fold lower
  ({$\sim$}60 nanomolar), whereas the potency of its stimulatory effect is
  \textbackslash textgreater100 fold higher, than reported, and is unexpectedly
  fully reversible. Strong, but greatly delayed, channel activation by
  picomolar Vx-770 identifies multiple sequential slow steps in the activation
  pathway. These findings provide solid guidelines for the design of in vitro
  studies using Vx-770.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is an ion
  channel that couples adenosine triphosphate (ATP) hydrolysis at its
  nucleotide-binding domains to gating transitions in its transmembrane
  domains. We previously reported that the charge-neutralized mutant R352C
  shows two distinct open states, O1 and O2 The two states could be
  distinguished by their single-channel current amplitudes: O1 having a smaller
  amplitude (representing a prehydrolytic open state) and O2 having a larger
  amplitude (representing a post-hydrolytic open state). In this study, a
  similar phenotype is described for two mutations of another pore-lining
  residue, N306D and N306E, suggesting that alterations of the net charge
  within CFTR's pore confer this unique conductance aberration. Because moving
  either of the two endogenous charges, R303 and R352, to positions further
  along TM5 and TM6, respectively, also results in this O1O2 phenotype, we
  conclude that the position of the charged residue in the internal vestibule
  affects hydrolysis-dependent conductance changes. Furthermore, our data show
  that the buffer and CFTR blocker morpholino propane sulfonic acid (MOPS-)
  occludes the O1 state more than it does the O2 state when the net charge of
  the internal vestibule is unchanged or increased. In contrast, when the net
  charge in the internal vestibule is decreased, the differential sensitivity
  to MOPS- block is diminished. We propose a three-state blocking mechanism to
  explain the charge-dependent sensitivity of prehydrolytic and post-hydrolytic
  open states to MOPS- block. We further posit that the internal vestibule
  expands during the O1 to O2 transition so that mutation-induced electrostatic
  perturbations within the pore are amplified by the smaller internal vestibule
  of the O1 state and thus result in the O1O2 phenotype and the
  charge-dependent sensitivity of the two open states to MOPS- block. Our study
  not only relates the O1O2 phenotype to the charge distribution in CFTR's
  internal vestibule but also provides a toolbox for mechanistic studies of
  CFTR gating by ATP hydrolysis.%

    Drug delivery systems have shown tremendous promise to improve the
  diagnostic and therapeutic effects of drugs due to their special property.
  Targeting tissue damage, tumors, or drugs with limited toxicity at the site
  of infection is the goal of successful pharmaceuticals. Targeted drug
  delivery has become significantly important in enhancing the pharmaceutical
  effects of drugs and reducing their side effects of therapeutics in the
  treatment of various disease conditions. Unfortunately, clinical translation
  of these targeted drug delivery system mechanisms faces many challenges. At
  present, only a few targeted drug delivery systems can achieve high targeting
  efficiency after intravenous injection, even though numerous surface markers
  and targeting approaches have been developed. Thus, cell-mediated
  drug-delivery targeting systems have received considerable attention for
  their enhanced therapeutic specificity and efficacy in the treatment of the
  disease. This review highlights the recent advances in the design of the
  different types of cells that have been explored for cell-mediated drug
  delivery and targeting mechanisms. A better understanding of cell biology
  orientation and a new generation of delivery strategies that utilize these
  endogenous approaches are expected to provide better solutions for specific
  site delivery and further facilitate clinical translation.%

    A key aspect of bacterial survival is the ability to evolve while migrating
  across spatially varying environmental challenges. Laboratory experiments,
  however, often study evolution in well-mixed systems. Here we introduce an
  experimental device, the Microbial Evolution and Growth Arena (MEGA) plate,
  in which bacteria spread and evolve on a large antibiotic landscape
  (120x60cm), allowing visual observation of mutation and selection in a
  migrating bacterial front. While resistance increases consistently, multiple
  coexisting lineages diversify both phenotypically and genotypically.
  Analyzing mutants at and behind the propagating front, we find that evolution
  is not always led by the most resistant mutants; highly resistant mutants may
  be trapped behind more sensitive lineages. The MEGA-plate provides a
  versatile platform for studying microbial adaption and a direct
  seeing-is-believing visualization of evolutionary dynamics.%
