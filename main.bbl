    Hofstadter's long-awaited return to the themes of G\"odel, Escher, Bach--an
  original and controversial view of the nature of consciousness and identity.
  What do we mean when we say "I"? Can a self, a soul, a consciousness, an "I"
  arise out of mere matter? If it cannot, then how can you or I be here? This
  book argues that the key to understanding selves and consciousness is a
  special kind of abstract feedback loop inhabiting our brains. Deep down, a
  human brain is a chaotic soup of particles, on a higher level it is a jungle
  of neurons, and on a yet higher level it is a network of abstractions that we
  call "symbols." The most central and complex symbol in your brain or mine is
  the one we both call "I." But how can such a mysterious abstraction be
  real--or is our "I" merely a convenient fiction?--From publisher description%

    Computational simulations, akin to wetlab experimentation, are subject to
  statistical fluctuations. Assessing the magnitude of these fluctuations, that
  is, assigning uncertainties to the computed results, is of critical
  importance to drawing statistically reliable conclusions. Here, we use a
  simulation box size as an independent variable, to demonstrate how crucial it
  is to gather sufficient amounts of data before drawing any conclusions about
  the potential thermodynamic and kinetic effects. In various systems, ranging
  from solvation free energies to protein conformational transition rates, we
  showcase how the proposed simulation box size effect disappears with
  increased sampling. This indicates that, if at all, the simulation box size
  only minimally affects both the thermodynamics and kinetics of the type of
  biomolecular systems presented in this work.%

    As access to computational resources continues to increase, free-energy
  calculations have emerged as a powerful tool that can play a predictive role
  in a wide range of research areas. Yet, the reliability of these calculations
  can often be improved significantly if a number of precepts, or good
  practices, are followed. Although the theory upon which these good practices
  rely has largely been known for many years, it is often overlooked or simply
  ignored. In other cases, the theoretical developments are too recent for
  their potential to be fully grasped and merged into popular platforms for the
  computation of free-energy differences. In this contribution, the current
  best practices for carrying out free-energy calculations using free energy
  perturbation and nonequilibrium work methods are discussed, demonstrating
  that at little to no additional cost, free-energy estimates could be markedly
  improved and bounded by meaningful error estimates. Monitoring the
  probability distributions that underlie the transformation between the states
  of interest, performing the calculation bidirectionally, stratifying the
  reaction pathway, and choosing the most appropriate paradigms and algorithms
  for transforming between states offer significant gains in both accuracy and
  precision. \textcopyright{} 2010 American Chemical Society.%

    Linear-scaling density functional theory (DFT) is an efficient method to
  describe the electronic structures of molecules, semiconductors, and
  insulators to avoid the high cubic-scaling cost in conventional DFT
  calculations. Here, we present a parallel implementation of linear-scaling
  density matrix trace correcting (TC) purification algorithm to solve the
  Kohn\textendash Sham (KS) equations with the numerical atomic orbitals in the
  HONPAS package. Such a linear-scaling density matrix purification algorithm
  is based on the Kohn's nearsightedness principle, resulting in a sparse
  Hamiltonian matrix with localized basis sets in the DFT calculations.
  Therefore, sparse matrix multiplication is the most time-consuming step in
  the density matrix purification algorithm for linear-scaling DFT
  calculations. We propose to use the MPI\_Allgather function for parallel
  programming to deal with the sparse matrix multiplication within the
  compressed sparse row (CSR) format, which can scale up to hundreds of
  processing cores on modern heterogeneous supercomputers. We demonstrate the
  computational accuracy and efficiency of this parallel density matrix
  purification algorithm by performing large-scale DFT calculations on boron
  nitrogen nanotubes containing tens of thousands of atoms.%

    We present a detailed description and comparison of algorithms for
  performing ab-initio quantum-mechanical calculations using pseudopotentials
  and a plane-wave basis set. We will discuss: (a) partial occupancies within
  the framework of the linear tetrahedron method and the finite temperature
  density-functional theory, (b) iterative methods for the diagonalization of
  the Kohn-Sham Hamiltonian and a discussion of an efficient iterative method
  based on the ideas of Pulay's residual minimization, which is close to an
  order Natoms2 scaling even for relatively large systems, (c) efficient
  Broyden-like and Pulay-like mixing methods for the charge density including a
  new special `preconditioning' optimized for a plane-wave basis set, (d)
  conjugate gradient methods for minimizing the electronic free energy with
  respect to all degrees of freedom simultaneously. We have implemented these
  algorithms within a powerful package called VAMP (Vienna ab-initio

    \field{abstract}{%
    Protein force fields have been undergoing continual development since the
  first complete parameter sets were introduced nearly four decades ago. The
  functional forms that underlie these models have many common elements for the
  treatment of bonded and nonbonded forces, which are reviewed here. The most
  widely used force fields to date use a fixed-charge convention in which
  electronic polarization effects are treated via a mean-field approximation
  during partial charge assignment. Despite success in modeling folded proteins
  over many years, the fixed-charge assumption has limitations that cannot
  necessarily be overcome within their potential energy equations. To overcome
  these limitations, several force fields have recently been derived that
  explicitly treat electronic polarization effects with straightforward
  extensions of the potential energy functions used by nonpolarizable force
  fields. Here, we review the history of the most popular nonpolarizable force
  fields (AMBER, CHARMM, OPLS, and GROMOS) as well as studies that have
  validated them and applied them to studies of protein folding and misfolding.
  Building upon these force fields are more recent polarizable interaction
  potentials, including fluctuating charge models, POSSIM, AMOEBA, and the
  classical Drude oscillator. These force fields differ in their
  implementations but all attempt to model electronic polarization in a
  computationally tractable manner. Despite their recent emergence in the field
  of protein folding, several studies have already applied these polarizable
  models to challenging problems in this domain, including the role of
  polarization in folding free energies and sequence-specific effects on the
  stability of {$\alpha$}-helical structures.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    In contrast to ordinary polymers, the vast majority of biological
  macromolecules adopt highly ordered three-dimensional structures that define
  their functions. The key to folding of a biopolymer into a unique 3D
  structure or to an assembly of several biopolymers into a functional unit is
  a delicate balance between the attractive and repulsive forces that also
  makes such self-assembly reversible under physiological conditions. The
  all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) method has emerged as a powerful tool for
  studies of individual biomolecules and their functional assemblies,
  encompassing systems of ever increasing complexity. However, advances in
  parallel computing technology have outpaced the development of the underlying
  theoretical models - the molecular force fields, pushing the MD method into
  an untested territory. Recent tests of the MD method have found the most
  commonly used molecular force fields to be out of balance, overestimating
  attractive interactions between charged and hydrophobic groups, which can
  promote artificial aggregation in MD simulations of multi-component protein,
  nucleic acid, and lipid systems. One route towards improving the force fields
  is through the NBFIX corrections method, in which the intermolecular forces
  are calibrated against experimentally measured quantities such as osmotic
  pressure by making atom pair-specific adjustments to the non-bonded
  interactions. In this article, we review development of the NBFIX (Non-Bonded
  FIX) corrections to the AMBER and CHARMM force fields and discuss their
  implications for MD simulations of electrolyte solutions, dense DNA systems,
  Holliday junctions, protein folding, and lipid bilayer membranes.%

    A simple two-temperature model makes an equal mixture of identical LJ
  particles phase separate and develop crystalline order in cold clusters. , We
  report scalar activity induced phase separation and crystallization in a
  system of 3-d Lennard-Jones particles taken at state points spanning from the
  gas to the liquid regime using molecular dynamics simulation (MD). Scalar
  activity was introduced by increasing the temperature of half of the
  particles (labeled `hot') while keeping the temperature of the other half
  constant at a lower value (labeled `cold'). The relative temperature
  difference between the two subsystems is considered as a measure of the
  activity. From our simulations we observe that the two species tend to phase
  separate at sufficiently high activity ratio. The extent of separation is
  quantified by the defined order parameter and the entropy production during
  this process is determined by employing the two-phase thermodynamic (2PT)
  model and the standard modified Benedict\textendash Webb\textendash Rubin
  (MBWR) equation of state for a LJ fluid. We observe that the extent of the
  phase separation and entropy production increases with the density of the
  system. From a cluster analysis, we obtain the mean number of clusters
  {$\langle$} n cl {$\rangle$}, and the mean size of the largest cluster
  {$\langle$} n 0 {$\rangle$} in the system, complementing each other. Bond
  orientation order parameters reveal that the so formed largest cluster also
  develops solid-like order consisting of both FCC and HCP packing. The
  presence of such crystalline order is also supported by a common neighbor
  analysis.%

    A simple and accurate expression for radial distribution function (RDF) of
  the Lennard-Jones fluid is presented. The expression explicitly states the
  RDF as a continuous function of reduced interparticle distance, temperature,
  and density. It satisfies the limiting conditions of zero density and
  infinite distance imposed by statistical thermodynamics. The distance
  dependence of this expression is expressed by an equation which contains 11
  adjustable parameters. These parameters are fitted to 353 RDF data, obtained
  by molecular dynamics calculations, and then expressed as functions of
  reduced distance, temperature and density. This expression, having a total of
  65 constants, reproduces the RDF data with an average root-mean-squared
  deviation of 0.0152 for the range of state variables of
  0.5{$\leqslant$}T{${_\ast}\leqslant$}5.1 and
  0.35{$\leqslant\rho{_\ast}\leqslant$}1.1 (T{${_\ast}$}=kT/{$\epsilon$} and
  {$\rho{_\ast}$}={$\rho\sigma$}3 are reduced temperature and density,
  respectively). The expression predicts the pressure and the internal energy
  of the Lennard-Jones fluid with an uncertainty that is comparable to that
  obtained directly from the molecular dynamics simulations.%

    The widely used CHARMM additive all-atom force field includes parameters
  for proteins, nucleic acids, lipids, and carbohydrates. In the present
  article, an extension of the CHARMM force field to drug-like molecules is
  presented. The resulting CHARMM General Force Field (CGenFF) covers a wide
  range of chemical groups present in biomolecules and drug-like molecules,
  including a large number of heterocyclic scaffolds. The parametrization
  philosophy behind the force field focuses on quality at the expense of
  transferability, with the implementation concentrating on an extensible force
  field. Statistics related to the quality of the parametrization with a focus
  on experimental validation are presented. Additionally, the parametrization
  procedure, described fully in the present article in the context of the model
  systems, pyrrolidine, and 3-phenoxymethylpyrrolidine will allow users to
  readily extend the force field to chemical groups that are not explicitly
  covered in the force field as well as add functional groups to and link
  together molecules already available in the force field. CGenFF thus makes it
  possible to perform "all-CHARMM" simulations on drug-target interactions
  thereby extending the utility of CHARMM force fields to medicinally relevant
  systems.%

    Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) are implicated in many human
  diseases. They have generally not been amenable to conventional
  structure-based drug design, however, because their intrinsic conformational
  variability has precluded an atomic-level understanding of their binding to
  small molecules. Here we present long-time-scale, atomic-level molecular
  dynamics (MD) simulations of monomeric {$\alpha$}-synuclein (an IDP whose
  aggregation is associated with Parkinson's disease) binding the
  small-molecule drug fasudil in which the observed protein\textendash ligand
  interactions were found to be in good agreement with previously reported NMR
  chemical shift data. In our simulations, fasudil, when bound, favored certain
  charge\textendash charge and {$\pi$}-stacking interactions near the C
  terminus of {$\alpha$}-synuclein but tended not to form these interactions
  simultaneously, rather breaking one of these interactions and forming another
  nearby (a mechanism we term dynamic shuttling). Further simulations with
  small molecules chosen to modify these interactions yielded binding
  affinities and key structural features of binding consistent with subsequent
  NMR experiments, suggesting the potential for MD-based strategies to
  facilitate the rational design of small molecules that bind with disordered
  proteins.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    Accurate force field parameters for proteins and drugs are of fundamental
  importance for predicting protein-drug binding poses and binding free
  energies in structure-based drug design. Osmotic pressure simulations have
  recently gained popularity as a means to validate common force fields for
  biomolecules such as proteins; up to now, however, little such effort has
  been made to use these methods to validate common force fields for small
  drug-like molecules. In this work, osmotic coefficients of 16 drug-like
  molecules were calculated from osmotic pressure molecular dynamics
  simulations using four common force fields for drug-like molecules: GAFF,
  CGenFF, OPLS-AA, and PRODRGFF. While GAFF, CGenFF, and OPLS-AA produced
  osmotic coefficients that are in good agreement with the corresponding
  experimental osmotic coefficients, PRODRGFF, which attempts to use GROMOS
  parameters, often produced osmotic coefficients that are in poor agreement.
  All four force fields poorly reproduced the experimental osmotic coefficients
  of purine-derived molecules including purine, 6-methylpurine, and caffeine,
  suggesting common issues in describing interactions of this particular
  molecule type. The poor overall performance of PRODRGFF can be mainly
  attributed to the poor results with two macrocyclic molecules HMT and TAT,
  which can be significantly improved by reparameterizing the van der Waals
  (vdW) parameters of alkyl carbons and using lower solute concentration. In
  addition, the recently developed GAFF2 with revamped vdW parameters was found
  to produce osmotic coefficients that are in slightly better agreement with
  experiments than GAFF. Overall, the four common force fields for drug-like
  molecules tested in this study performed reasonably well at reproducing
  experimental osmotic coefficients of drug-like molecules, although failures
  of certain force fields on certain molecules suggest that further force field
  reparameterizations, especially for vdW parameters, might be required to
  improve their accuracy.%

    Biomolecular simulations are typically performed in an aqueous environment
  where the number of ions remains fixed for the duration of the simulation,
  generally with either a minimally neutralizing ion environment or a number of
  salt pairs intended to match the macroscopic salt concentration. In contrast,
  real biomolecules experience local ion environments where the salt
  concentration is dynamic and may differ from bulk. The degree of salt
  concentration variability and average deviation from the macroscopic
  concentration remains, as yet, unknown. Here, we describe the theory and
  implementation of a Monte Carlo osmostat that can be added to explicit
  solvent molecular dynamics or Monte Carlo simulations to sample from a
  semigrand canonical ensemble in which the number of salt pairs fluctuates
  dynamically during the simulation. The osmostat reproduce the correct
  equilibrium statistics for a simulation volume that can exchange ions with a
  large reservoir at a defined macroscopic salt concentration. To achieve
  useful Monte Carlo acceptance rates, the method makes use of nonequilibrium
  candidate Monte Carlo (NCMC) moves in which monovalent ions and water
  molecules are alchemically transmuted using short nonequilibrium
  trajectories, with a modified Metropolis-Hastings criterion ensuring correct
  equilibrium statistics for an {$\Delta\mu$}, N, p, T) ensemble. We
  demonstrate how typical protein (DHFR and the tyrosine kinase Src) and
  nucleic acid (Drew-Dickerson B-DNA dodecamer) systems exhibit salt
  concentration distributions that significantly differ from fixed-salt bulk
  simulations and display fluctuations that are on the same order of magnitude
  as the average.%

    Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of heptane/vapor, hexadecane/vapor,
  water/vapor, hexadecane/water, and dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC)
  bilayers and monolayers are analyzed to determine the accuracy of treating
  long-range interactions in interfaces with the isotropic periodic sum (IPS)
  method. The method and cutoff (rc) dependences of surface tensions, density
  profiles, water dipole orientation, and electrostatic potential profiles are
  used as metrics. The water/vapor, heptane/vapor, and hexadecane/vapor
  interfaces are accurately and efficiently calculated with 2D IPS (rc = 10 \AA
  ). It is demonstrated that 3D IPS is not practical for any of the interfacial
  systems studied. However, the hybrid method PME/IPS [Particle Mesh Ewald for
  electrostatics and 3D IPS for Lennard-Jones (LJ) interactions] provides an
  efficient way to include both types of long-range forces in simulations of
  large liquid/vacuum and all liquid/liquid interfaces, including lipid
  monolayers and bilayers. A previously published pressure-based long-range LJ
  correction yields results similar to those of PME/IPS for liquid/liquid
  interfaces. The contributions to surface tension of LJ terms arising from
  interactions beyond 10 \AA{} range from 13 dyn/cm for the hexadecane/vapor
  interface to approximately 3 dyn/cm for hexadecane/water and DPPC bilayers
  and monolayers. Surface tensions of alkane/vapor, hexadecane/water, and DPPC
  monolayers based on the CHARMM lipid force fields agree very well with
  experiment, whereas surface tensions of the TIP3P and TIP4P-Ew water models
  underestimate experiment by 16 and 11 dyn/cm, respectively. Dipole potential
  drops ({$\Delta\Psi$}) are less sensitive to long-range LJ interactions than
  surface tensions. However, {$\Delta\Psi$} for the DPPC bilayer (845 {$\pm$} 3
  mV proceeding from water to lipid) and water (547 {$\pm$} 2 mV for TIP4P-Ew
  and 521 {$\pm$} 3 mV for TIP3P) overestimate experiment by factors of 3 and
  5, respectively, and represent expected deficiencies in nonpolarizable force
  fields.%

    3D-IPS/DFFT is an extension of the three-dimensional isotropic periodic sum
  (3D-IPS) for evaluation of electrostatic and Lennard-Jones interactions in
  heterogeneous systems; it utilizes a discrete fast Fourier transform (DFFT)
  for efficient calculation of the IPS potential with a large local region
  radius. The method is demonstrated to be highly accurate for simple bulk
  fluids, liquid/liquid and liquid/vapor interfaces, and lipid bilayers and
  monolayers. Values for rC (the cutoff distance for direct evaluation of
  pairs) and RC (the local region radius) equal to 10 \AA{} and twice the
  longest edge of the periodic cell, respectively, provide excellent efficiency
  and accuracy. Dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC) monolayers simulated with
  the CHARMM (Chemistry at HARvard Molecular Mechanics) C27r lipid parameter
  set and 3D-IPS/DFFT yield surface tensions approximately 8 dyn/cm higher than
  those simulated using particle mesh Ewald (PME), and with experiment. In
  contrast, surface tensions for DMPC bilayers are 16 dyn/cm/leaflet with both
  3D-IPS/DFFT (rC = 10 and 12 \AA ) and PME (rC = 12 \AA ). This indicates that
  PME (rC = 12 \AA ) may be used for simulations of bilayers, but not
  monolayers, and that the large bilayer surface tension arising from C27r is
  incorrect.%

    We report the results from a molecular dynamics (MD) simulation on a 1.0 M
  aqueous NaCl solution using the classical SPC water model and a treatment of
  long-range electrostatic forces involving a 9\textendash 16 \AA{} twin-range
  cut-off. This study was undertaken to explore the importance of truncation
  effects in simulations involving charged species which employ cut-offs at
  longer range than typically used in MD. Artefacts were discerned in the
  ion-ion radial distribution functions at {$\approx$} 16 \AA, indicating that
  increasing the length scale of the truncation scheme does not necessarily
  lead to reliable trajectories. Our results indicate that `charge group-charge
  group' radial distribution functions are a sensitive test for the detection
  of artefacts due to truncation and it is suggested that they should be used
  as a routine screening device in the analysis of MD systems involving charged
  groups.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    Ewald summation, which has become the de facto standard for computing
  electrostatic interactions in biomolecular simulations, formally requires
  that the simulation box is neutral. For non-neutral systems, the Ewald
  algorithm implicitly introduces a uniform background charge distribution that
  effectively neutralizes the simulation box. Because a uniform distribution of
  counter charges typically deviates from the spatial distribution of
  counterions in real systems, artifacts may arise, in particular in systems
  with an inhomogeneous dielectric constant. Here, we derive an analytical
  expression for the effect of using an implicit background charge instead of
  explicit counterions, on the chemical potential of ions in heterogeneous
  systems, which (i) provides a quantitative criterium for deciding if the
  background charge offers an acceptable trade-off between artifacts arising
  from sampling problems and artifacts arising from the homogeneous background
  charge distribution, and (ii) can be used to correct this artifact in certain
  cases. Our model quantifies the artifact in terms of the difference in charge
  density between the non-neutral system with a uniform neutralizing background
  charge and the real neutral system with a physically correct distribution of
  explicit counterions. We show that for inhomogeneous systems, such as
  proteins and membranes in water, the artifact manifests itself by an
  overstabilization of ions inside the lower dielectric by tens to even
  hundreds kilojoules per mole. We have tested the accuracy of our model in
  molecular dynamics simulations and found that the error in the calculated
  free energy for moving a test charge from water into hexadecane, at different
  net charges of the system and different simulation box sizes, is correctly
  predicted by the model. The calculations further confirm that the incorrect
  distribution of counter charges in the simulation box is solely responsible
  for the errors in the PMFs.%

    The multilevel summation method (MSM) offers an efficient algorithm
  utilizing convolution for evaluating long-range forces arising in molecular
  dynamics simulations. Shifting the balance of computation and communication,
  MSM provides key advantages over the ubiquitous particle-mesh Ewald (PME)
  method, offering better scaling on parallel computers and permitting more
  modeling flexibility, with support for periodic systems as does PME but also
  for semiperiodic and nonperiodic systems. The version of MSM available in the
  simulation program NAMD is described, and its performance and accuracy are
  compared with the PME method. The accuracy feasible for MSM in practical
  applications reproduces PME results for water property calculations of
  density, diffusion constant, dielectric constant, surface tension, radial
  distribution function, and distancedependent Kirkwood factor, even though the
  numerical accuracy of PME is higher than that of MSM. Excellent agreement
  between MSM and PME is found also for interface potentials of air-water and
  membrane-water interfaces, where long-range Coulombic interactions are
  crucial. Applications demonstrate also the suitability of MSM for systems
  with semiperiodic and nonperiodic boundaries. For this purpose, simulations
  have been performed with periodic boundaries along directions parallel to a
  membrane surface but not along the surface normal, yielding membrane pore
  formation induced by an imbalance of charge across the membrane. Using a
  similar semiperiodic boundary condition, ion conduction through a graphene
  nanopore driven by an ion gradient has been simulated. Furthermore, proteins
  have been simulated inside a single spherical water droplet. Finally,
  parallel scalability results show the ability of MSM to outperform PME when
  scaling a system of modest size (less than 100 K atoms) to over a thousand
  processors, demonstrating the suitability of MSM for large-scale parallel
  simulation.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    Traditionally, the dependence of enzyme activity on temperature has been
  described by a model consisting of two processes: the catalytic reaction
  defined by {$\Delta$}GDaggercat, and irreversible inactivation defined by
  {$\Delta$}GDaggerinact. However, such a model does not account for the
  observed temperature-dependent behaviour of enzymes, and a new model has been
  developed and validated. This model (the Equilibrium Model) describes a new
  mechanism by which enzymes lose activity at high temperatures, by including
  an inactive form of the enzyme (Einact) that is in reversible equilibrium
  with the active form (Eact); it is the inactive form that undergoes
  irreversible thermal inactivation to the thermally denatured state. This
  equilibrium is described by an equilibrium constant whose
  temperature-dependence is characterized in terms of the enthalpy of the
  equilibrium, {$\Delta$}Heq, and a new thermal parameter, Teq, which is the
  temperature at which the concentrations of Eact and Einact are equal; Teq may
  therefore be regarded as the thermal equivalent of Km. Characterization of an
  enzyme with respect to its temperature-dependent behaviour must therefore
  include a determination of these intrinsic properties. The Equilibrium Model
  has major implications for enzymology, biotechnology and understanding the
  evolution of enzymes. The present study presents a new direct data-fitting
  method based on fitting progress curves directly to the Equilibrium Model,
  and assesses the robustness of this procedure and the effect of assay data on
  the accurate determination of Teq and its associated parameters. It also
  describes simpler experimental methods for their determination than have been
  previously available, including those required for the application of the
  Equilibrium Model to non-ideal enzyme reactions.%

    To investigate the damage of cell membrane induced by vacuum treatment at
  different pressure reduction rates, the onion epidermis was subjected to
  three different pressure reduction rates in a miniaturized, visual and
  vernier regulation experimental setup. The results of physical tests agreed
  well with the result of optical microscopy, which showed that treatment at
  the medium pressure reduction rate resulted in minimum changes in the spaces
  between the cell membrane and cell wall, water loss, relative electrical
  conductivity, color and micromechanical properties. Experimental results
  showed that the pressure reduction rate had obvious effects on the cell
  membrane integrity of vacuum-treated onion epidermis. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS
  This work tested the effect extent of different pressure rates on the cell
  membrane integrity during vacuum treatment, which has been demonstrated to
  provide many benefits to the food processing industry. This research could
  help the users to choose the appropriate operating parameters, to predict the
  characteristics of vacuum cooled products, to understand the mechanism of
  vacuum treatment and to learn the design of vacuum cooling equipment.%

    Molecular simulations are a computational technique used to investigate the
  dynamics of proteins and other molecules. The free energy landscape of these
  simulations is often rugged, and minor differences in the initial velocities,
  floating-point precision, or underlying hardware can cause identical
  simulations (replicas) to take different paths in the landscape. In this
  study we investigated the magnitude of these effects based on 310\,000 ns of
  simulation time. We performed 100 identically parametrized replicas of 3000
  ns each for a small 10 amino acid system as well as 100 identically
  parametrized replicas of 100 ns each for an 827 residue T-cell receptor/MHC
  system. Comparing randomly chosen subgroups within these replica sets, we
  estimated the reproducibility and reliability that can be achieved by a given
  number of replicas at a given simulation time. These results demonstrate that
  conclusions drawn from single simulations are often not reproducible and that
  conclusions drawn from multiple shorter replicas are more reliable than those
  from a single longer simulation. The actual number of replicas needed will
  always depend on the question asked and the level of reliability sought. On
  the basis of our data, it appears that a good rule of thumb is to perform a
  minimum of five to 10 replicas.%

    The authors present a new molecular dynamics algorithm for sampling the
  canonical distribution. In this approach the velocities of all the particles
  are rescaled by a properly chosen random factor. The algorithm is formally
  justified and it is shown that, in spite of its stochastic nature, a quantity
  can still be defined that remains constant during the evolution. In numerical
  applications this quantity can be used to measure the accuracy of the
  sampling. The authors illustrate the properties of this new method on
  Lennard-Jones and TIP4P water models in the solid and liquid phases. Its
  performance is excellent and largely independent of the thermostat parameter
  also with regard to the dynamic properties. \textcopyright{} 2007 American

    The kinetics of ruptures of giant vesicles under constant tension have been
  investigated under various conditions, which will help in the application of
  these techniques in the biomedical, bioengineering, and biotechnological
  fields. , External tension in membranes plays a vital role in numerous
  physiological and physicochemical phenomena. In this review, recent
  developments in the constant electric- and mechanical-tension-induced rupture
  of giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) are considered. We summarize the results
  relating to the kinetics of GUV rupture as a function of membrane surface
  charge, ions in the bathing solution, lipid composition, cholesterol content
  in the membrane, and osmotic pressure. The mechanical stability and line
  tension of the membrane under these conditions are discussed. The membrane
  tension due to osmotic pressure and the critical tension of rupture for
  various membrane compositions are also discussed. The results and their
  analysis provide a biophysical description of the kinetics of rupture, along
  with insight into biological processes. Future directions and possible
  developments in this research area are included.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    This chapter discusses that high hydrostatic pressure affects equilibria
  and reaction rates through the molar volume changes involved in the reaction
  system as a whole. The chapter explains how high hydrostatic pressure affects
  molecules of biological interest, and their interactions; the ways in which
  pressure affects cellular processes; and how animals, including humans are
  affected by pressure. Along with high pressure, the chapter also intends to
  stimulate interest in a particular approach to physiology. The discussion on
  molecular effects of pressure and temperature includes equilibrium processes
  in aqueous solution, lipid bilayers under pressure and rates of chemical
  reactions. It is mentioned that hydrostatic pressure is not directional and
  that osmotic pressure is also quite separate from hydrostatic pressure.
  Hydrostatic pressure is a force acting in all directions, in the air one
  breathes, in water, or in body fluids. While high pressure, surprisingly
  perhaps, dissociates molecules in aqueous solution, it has the intuitively
  expected effect on lipid bilayers, compressing and ordering their structure.
  The thermodynamics of equilibrium processes in aqueous solution, and the
  phase state of lipid bilayers at high pressure, inevitably fall short of
  explaining how pressure affects rates of reaction. Muscle, a tissue whose
  cells are conspicuously filled with polymerized proteins, is affected by high
  pressure in ways determined by the contraction cycle. Simple processes, such
  as the diffusion of gases or water in aqueous solution, are little affected
  by the pressure range of interest here. Chondrocytes are cells, which
  synthesize the load-bearing extracellular matrixthat covers the articulating
  surfaces of joints. The buoyancy of aquatic animals subjected to significant
  pressure is interesting because buoyancy requires the creation of a void or
  region of low-density, working against the ambient pressure. Animals and
  bacteria live at high pressures in the deep sea, down to the greatest depths
  where the pressure is approximately 100 MPa. Several technological
  applications have arisen from high pressure biology\textemdash the
  manipulation of ploidy, and of membrane proteins; sterilization and
  inactivation of microorganisms; food processing; and safe human diving.%

    A method is developed for representing any communication system
  geometrically. Messages and the corresponding signals are points in two
  "function spaces," and the modulation process is a mapping of one space into
  the other. Using this representation, a number of results in communication
  theory are deduced concerning expansion and compression of bandwidth and the
  threshold effect. Formulas are found for the maxmum rate of transmission of
  binary digits over a system when the signal is perturbed by various types of
  noise. Some of the properties of "ideal" systems which transmit at this
  maxmum rate are discussed. The equivalent number of binary digits per second
  for certain information sources is calculated.%

    The St\"ormer\textendash Verlet\textendash leapfrog group of integrators
  commonly used in molecular dynamics simulations has long become a textbook
  subject and seems to have been studied exhaustively. There are, however, a
  few striking effects in performance of algorithms which are well known but
  have not received adequate attention in the literature. A closer view of
  these unclear observations results in unexpected conclusions. It is shown
  here that contrary to the conventional point of view, the leapfrog scheme is
  distinguished in this group both in terms of the order of truncation errors
  and the conservation of the total energy. In this case the characteristic
  square growth of fluctuations of the total energy with the step size,
  commonly measured in numerical tests, results from additional interpolation
  errors with no relation to the accuracy of the computed trajectory. An
  alternative procedure is described for checking energy conservation of
  leapfrog-like algorithms which is free from interpolation errors. Preliminary
  tests on a representative model system suggest that standard step size values
  used at present are lower than necessary for accurate sampling.%

    A systematic analysis is performed on the effectiveness of removing degrees
  of freedom from hydrogen atoms and/or increasing hydrogen masses to increase
  the efficiency of molecular dynamics simulations of hydrogen-rich systems
  such as proteins in water. In proteins, high-frequency bond-angle vibrations
  involving hydrogen atoms limit the time step to 3 fs, which is already a
  factor of 1.5 beyond the commonly used time step of 2 fs. Removing these
  degrees of freedom from the system by constructing hydrogen atoms as dummy
  atoms, allows the time step to be increased to 7 fs, a factor of 3.5 compared
  with 2 fs. Additionally, a gain in simulation stability can be achieved by
  increasing the masses of hydrogen atoms with remaining degrees of freedom
  from 1 to 4 u. Increasing hydrogen mass without removing the high-frequency
  degrees of freedom allows the time step to be increased only to 4 fs, a
  factor of two, compared with 2 fs. The net gain in efficiency of sampling
  configurational space may be up to 15\% lower than expected from the increase
  in time step due to the increase in viscosity and decrease in diffusion
  constant. In principle, introducing dummy atoms and increasing hydrogen mass
  do not influence thermodynamical properties of the system and dynamical
  properties are shown to be influenced only to a moderate degree. Comparing
  the maximum time step attainable with these methods (7 fs) to the time step
  of 2 fs that is routinely used in simulation, and taking into account the
  increase in viscosity and decrease in diffusion constant, we can say that a
  net gain in simulation efficiency of a factor of 3 to 3.5 can be achieved.

    In this article, we present a new LINear Constraint Solver (LINCS) for
  molecular simulations with bond constraints. The algorithm is inherently
  stable, as the constraints themselves are reset instead of derivatives of the
  constraints, thereby eliminating drift. Although the derivation of the
  algorithm is presented in terms of matrices, no matrix matrix multiplications
  are needed and only the nonzero matrix elements have to be stored, making the
  method useful for very large molecules. At the same accuracy, the LINCS
  algorithm is three to four times faster than the SHAKE algorithm.
  Parallelization of the algorithm is straightforward. \textcopyright{} 1997

    \field{abstract}{%
    The time step of atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations is
  determined by the fastest motions in the system and is typically limited to 2
  fs. An increasingly popular solution is to increase the mass of the hydrogen
  atoms to \textasciitilde 3 amu and decrease the mass of the parent atom by an
  equivalent amount. This approach, known as hydrogen-mass repartitioning
  (HMR), permits time steps up to 4 fs with reasonable simulation stability.
  While HMR has been applied in many published studies to date, it has not been
  extensively tested for membrane-containing systems. Here, we compare the
  results of simulations of a variety of membranes and membrane-protein systems
  run using a 2-fs time step and a 4-fs time step with HMR. For pure membrane
  systems, we find almost no difference in structural properties, such as
  area-per-lipid, electron density profiles, and order parameters, although
  there are differences in kinetic properties such as the diffusion constant.
  Conductance through a porin in an applied field, partitioning of a small
  peptide, hydrogen-bond dynamics, and membrane mixing show very little
  dependence on HMR and the time step. We also tested a 9-\AA{} cutoff compared
  to the standard CHARMM cutoff of 12 \AA, finding significant deviations in
  many properties tested. We conclude that HMR is a valid approach for membrane
  systems but a 9-\AA{} cutoff is not.,%

    Membrane ion channels are the fundamental electrical components in the
  nervous system. Recent developments in X-ray crystallography and cryo-EM
  microscopy have revealed what these proteins look like in atomic detail but
  do not tell us how they function. Molecular dynamics simulations have
  progressed to the point that we can now simulate realistic molecular
  assemblies to produce quantitative calculations of the thermodynamic and
  kinetic quantities that control function. In this review, we summarize the
  state of atomistic simulation methods for ion channels to understand their
  conduction, activation, and drug modulation mechanisms. We are at a
  crossroads in atomistic simulation, where long time scale observation can
  provide unbiased exploration of mechanisms, supplemented by biased free

    Spontaneous transitions between the native and non-native protein
  conformations are normally rare events that hardly take place in typical
  unbiased molecular dynamics simulations. It was recently demonstrated that
  such transitions can be well described by a reaction coordinate, Q, that
  represents the collective fraction of the native contacts between the protein
  atoms. Here we attempt to use this reaction coordinate to enhance the
  conformational sampling. We perform umbrella sampling simulations with
  biasing potentials on Q for two model proteins, Trp-Cage and BBA, using the
  CHARMM force field. Hamiltonian replica exchange is implemented in these
  simulations to further facilitate the sampling. The simulations appear to
  have reached satisfactory convergence, resulting in unbiased free energies as
  a function of Q. In addition to the native structure, multiple folded
  conformations are identified in the reconstructed equilibrium ensemble. Some
  conformations without any native contacts nonetheless have rather compact
  geometries and are stabilized by hydrogen bonds not present in the native
  structure. Whereas the enhanced sampling along Q reasonably reproduces the
  equilibrium conformational space, we also find that the folding of an
  {$\alpha$}-helix in Trp-Cage is a slow degree of freedom orthogonal to Q and
  therefore cannot be accelerated by biasing the reaction coordinate. Overall,
  we conclude that whereas Q is an excellent parameter to analyze the
  simulations, it is not necessarily a perfect reaction coordinate for enhanced
  sampling, and better incorporation of other slow degrees of freedom may
  further improve this reaction coordinate.%

    Potential of mean force (PMF) calculations are used to characterize the
  free energy landscape of protein\textendash lipid and protein\textendash
  protein association within membranes. Coarse-grained simulations allow
  binding free energies to be determined with reasonable statistical error.
  This accuracy relies on defining a good collective variable to describe the
  binding and unbinding transitions, and upon criteria for assessing the
  convergence of the simulation toward representative equilibrium sampling. As
  examples, we calculate protein\textendash lipid binding PMFs for
  ANT/cardiolipin and Kir2.2/PIP2, using umbrella sampling on a distance
  coordinate. These highlight the importance of replica exchange between
  windows for convergence. The use of two independent sets of simulations,
  initiated from bound and unbound states, provide strong evidence for
  simulation convergence. For a model protein\textendash protein interaction
  within a membrane, center-of-mass distance is shown to be a poor collective
  variable for describing transmembrane helix\textendash helix dimerization.
  Instead, we employ an alternative intermolecular distance matrix RMS (DRMS)
  coordinate to obtain converged PMFs for the association of the glycophorin
  transmembrane domain. While the coarse-grained force field gives a reasonable
  Kd for dimerization, the majority of the bound population is revealed to be
  in a near-native conformation. Thus, the combination of a refined reaction
  coordinate with improved sampling reveals previously unnoticed complexities
  of the dimerization free energy landscape. We propose the use of
  replica-exchange umbrella sampling starting from different initial conditions
  as a robust approach for calculation of the binding energies in membrane
  simulations.%

    The weighted histogram analysis method (WHAM) has become the standard
  technique for the analysis of umbrella sampling simulations. In this article,
  we address the challenges (1) of obtaining fast and accurate solutions of the
  coupled nonlinear WHAM equations, (2) of quantifying the statistical errors
  of the resulting free energies, (3) of diagnosing possible systematic errors,
  and (4) of optimally allocating of the computational resources.
  Traditionally, the WHAM equations are solved by a fixed-point direct
  iteration method, despite poor convergence and possible numerical
  inaccuracies in the solutions. Here, we instead solve the mathematically
  equivalent problem of maximizing a target likelihood function, by using
  superlinear numerical optimization algorithms with a significantly faster
  convergence rate. To estimate the statistical errors in one-dimensional free
  energy profiles obtained from WHAM, we note that for densely spaced umbrella
  windows with harmonic biasing potentials, the WHAM free energy profile can be
  approximated by a coarse-grained free energy obtained by integrating the mean
  restraining forces. The statistical errors of the coarse-grained free
  energies can be estimated straightforwardly and then used for the WHAM
  results. A generalization to multidimensional WHAM is described. We also
  propose two simple statistical criteria to test the consistency between the
  histograms of adjacent umbrella windows, which help identify inadequate
  sampling and hysteresis in the degrees of freedom orthogonal to the reaction
  coordinate. Together, the estimates of the statistical errors and the
  diagnostics of inconsistencies in the potentials of mean force provide a
  basis for the efficient allocation of computational resources in free energy
  simulations.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    The human multidrug transporter P-glycoprotein (P-gp) transports over 200
  chemically diverse substrates, influencing their bioavailability and tissue
  distribution. Pharmacological studies have identified both competitive and
  noncompetitive P-gp substrates, but neither the precise location of the
  substrate binding sites, nor the basis of competitive and noncompetitive
  interactions has been fully characterized. Here, potential of mean force
  (PMF) calculations are used to identify the transport-competent minimum free
  energy binding locations of five compounds, Hoechst 33342, Rhodamine 123,
  paclitaxel, tariquidar, and verapamil to P-gp. Unrestrained molecular
  dynamics simulations were also performed to confirm the substrates were
  stable in the energy wells determined using the PMF calculations. All
  compounds had energy minima within the P-gp transmembrane (TM) pore. For
  Hoechst 33342 and Rhodamine 123, a second minimum outside the TM pore was
  also identified. Based on this and previous studies of nicardipine and
  morphine [ Subramanian et al. J. Chem. Inf. Model. 2015, 55, 1202 ], a
  general scheme that accounts for the observed noncompetitive and competitive
  substrate interactions with P-gp is proposed.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    Changes in free energy provide valuable information for molecular
  recognition, including both ligand\textendash receptor binding thermodynamics
  and kinetics. Umbrella sampling (US), a widely used free energy calculation
  method, has long been used to explore the dissociation process of
  ligand\textendash receptor systems and compute binding free energy. In
  existing publications, the binding free energy computed from the potential of
  mean force (PMF) with US simulation mostly yielded ``ball park'' values with
  experimental data. However, the computed PMF values are highly influenced by
  factors such as initial conformations and/or trajectories provided, the
  reaction coordinate, and sampling of conformational space in each US window.
  These critical factors have rarely been carefully studied. Here we used US to
  study the guest aspirin and 1-butanol dissociation processes of
  {$\beta$}-cyclodextrin ({$\beta$}-CD) and an inhibitor SB2 dissociation from
  a p38{$\alpha$} mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) complex. For
  {$\beta$}-CD, we used three different {$\beta$}-CD conformations to generate
  the dissociation path with US windows. For p38{$\alpha$}, we generated the
  dissociation pathway by using accelerated molecular dynamics followed by
  conformational relaxing with short conventional MD, steered MD, and manual
  pulling. We found that, even for small {$\beta$}-CD complexes, different
  {$\beta$}-CD conformations altered the height of the PMF, but the pattern of
  PMF was not affected if the MD sampling in each US window was well-converged.
  Because changing the macrocyclic ring conformation needs to rotate dihedral
  angles in the ring, a bound ligand largely restrains the motion of
  cyclodextrin. Therefore, once a guest is in the binding site, cyclodextrin
  cannot freely change its initial conformation, resulting in different
  absolute heights of the PMF, which cannot be overcome by running excessively
  long MD simulations for each US window. Moreover, if the US simulations were
  not converged, the important barrier and minimum were missed. For
  ligand\textendash protein systems, our studies also suggest that the
  dissociation trajectories modeled by an enhanced sampling method must
  maintain a natural molecular movement to avoid biased PMF plots when using US
  simulations.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    GLIC is a bacterial member of the large family of pentameric ligand-gated
  ion channels. To study ion conduction through GLIC and other membrane
  channels, we combine the one-dimensional potential of mean force for ion
  passage with a Smoluchowski diffusion model, making it possible to calculate
  single-channel conductance in the regime of low ion concentrations from
  all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. We then perform MD simulations
  to examine sodium ion conduction through the GLIC transmembrane pore in two
  systems with different bulk ion concentrations. The ion potentials of mean
  force, calculated from umbrella sampling simulations with Hamiltonian replica
  exchange, reveal a major barrier at the hydrophobic constriction of the pore.
  The relevance of this barrier for ion transport is confirmed by a committor
  function that rises sharply in the barrier region. From the free evolution of
  Na(+) ions starting at the barrier top, we estimate the effective diffusion
  coefficient in the barrier region, and subsequently calculate the conductance
  of the pore. The resulting diffusivity compares well with the
  position-dependent ion diffusion coefficient obtained from restrained
  simulations. The ion conductance obtained from the diffusion model agrees
  with the value determined via a reactive-flux rate calculation. Our results
  show that the conformation in the GLIC crystal structure, with an estimated
  conductance of \textasciitilde 1 picosiemens at 140 mM ion concentration, is
  consistent with a physiologically open state of the channel.%

    Metadynamics is an important enhanced sampling technique in molecular
  dynamics simulation to efficiently explore potential energy surfaces. The
  recently developed transition-tempered metadynamics (TTMetaD) has been proven
  to converge asymptotically without sacrificing exploration of the collective
  variable space in the early stages of simulations, unlike other convergent
  metadynamics (MetaD) methods. We have applied TTMetaD to study the permeation
  of drug-like molecules through a lipid bilayer to further investigate the
  usefulness of this method as applied to problems of relevance to medicinal
  chemistry. First, ethanol permeation through a lipid bilayer was studied to
  compare TTMetaD with nontempered metadynamics and well-tempered metadynamics.
  The bias energies computed from various metadynamics simulations were
  compared to the potential of mean force calculated from umbrella sampling.
  Though all of the MetaD simulations agree with one another asymptotically,
  TTMetaD is able to predict the most accurate and reliable estimate of the
  potential of mean force for permeation in the early stages of the simulations
  and is robust to the choice of required additional parameters. We also show
  that using multiple randomly initialized replicas allows convergence analysis
  and also provides an efficient means to converge the simulations in shorter
  wall times and, more unexpectedly, in shorter CPU times; splitting the CPU
  time between multiple replicas appears to lead to less overall error. After
  validating the method, we studied the permeation of a more complicated
  drug-like molecule, trimethoprim. Three sets of TTMetaD simulations with
  different choices of collective variables were carried out, and all converged
  within feasible simulation time. The minimum free energy paths showed that
  TTMetaD was able to predict almost identical permeation mechanisms in each
  case despite significantly different definitions of collective variables.%

    Metadynamics is a commonly used and successful enhanced sampling method. By
  the introduction of a history dependent bias which depends on a restricted
  number of collective variables it can explore complex free energy surfaces
  characterized by several metastable states separated by large free energy
  barriers. Here we extend its scope by introducing a simple yet powerful
  method for calculating the rates of transition between different metastable
  states. The method does not rely on a previous knowledge of the transition
  states or reaction coordinates, as long as collective variables are known
  that can distinguish between the various stable minima in free energy space.
  We demonstrate that our method recovers the correct escape rates out of these
  stable states and also preserves the correct sequence of state-to-state
  transitions, with minimal extra computational effort needed over ordinary
  metadynamics. We apply the formalism to three different problems and in each
  case find excellent agreement with the results of long unbiased molecular
  dynamics runs.%

    Sampling a molecular process characterized by an activation free energy
  significantly larger than kBT is a well-known challenge in molecular dynamics
  simulations. In a recent work [Tiwary and Parrinello, Phys. Rev. Lett. 2013,
  111, 230602], we have demonstrated that the transition times of activated
  molecular transformations can be computed from well-tempered metadynamics
  provided that no bias is deposited in the transition state region and that
  the set of collective variables chosen to enhance sampling does not display
  hysteresis. Ensuring though that these two criteria are met may not always be
  simple. Here we build on the fact that the times of escape from a long-lived
  metastable state obey Poisson statistics. This allows us to identify
  quantitative measures of trustworthiness of our calculation. We test our
  method on a few paradigmatic examples. \textcopyright{} 2014 American

    Recently, we have introduced a new method, metadynamics, which is able to
  sample rarely occurring transitions and to reconstruct the free energy as a
  function of several variables with a controlled accuracy. This method has
  been successfully applied in many different fields, ranging from chemistry to
  biophysics and ligand docking and from material science to crystal structure
  prediction. We present an important development that speeds up metadynamics
  calculations by orders of magnitude and renders the algorithm much more
  robust. We use multiple interacting simulations, walkers, for exploring and
  reconstructing the same free energy surface. Each walker contributes to the
  history-dependent potential that, in metadynamics, is an estimate of the free
  energy. We show that the error on the reconstructed free energy does not
  depend on the number of walkers, leading to a fully linear scaling algorithm
  even on inexpensive loosely coupled clusters of PCs. In addition, we show
  that the accuracy and stability of the method are much improved by combining
  it with a weighted histogram analysis. We check the validity of our new
  method on a realistic application.%

    Despite the progress in modeling complex molecular systems of
  ever-increasing complexity, a quantitatively accurate computational treatment
  of ion permeation through narrow membrane channels remains challenging. An
  important factor to reach this goal is induced electronic polarization, which
  is likely to impact the permeation rate of small ions through narrow
  molecular pores. In this work, we extended the recently developed polarizable
  force field based on the classical Drude oscillators to assess the role of
  induced polarization effects on the energetics of sodium and potassium ion
  transport across the gramicidin A (gA) ion channel. The inclusion of induced
  polarization lowers barriers present in 1D potential of mean force (PMF) for
  cation permeation by {$\sim$}50\% compared to those obtained with the
  additive force field. Conductance properties calculated with 1D PMFs from
  Drude simulations are in better agreement with experimental results.
  Polarization of single-file water molecules and protein atoms forming the
  narrow pore has a direct impact on the free-energy barriers and
  cation-specific solid-state NMR chemical shifts. Sensitivity analysis
  indicates that small changes to water\textendash channel interactions can
  alter the free energy barrier for ion permeation. These results, illustrating
  polarization effects present in the complex electrostatic environment of the
  gA channel, have broad implications for revising proposed mechanisms of ion
  permeation and selectivity in a variety of ion channels.%

    Additive force fields are designed to account for induced electronic
  polarization in a mean-field average way, using effective empirical fixed
  charges. The limitation of this approximation is cause for serious concerns,
  particularly in the case of lipid membranes, where the molecular environment
  undergoes dramatic variations over microscopic length scales. A polarizable
  force field based on the classical Drude oscillator offers a practical and
  computationally efficient framework for an improved representation of
  electrostatic interactions in molecular simulations. Building on the
  first-generation Drude polarizable force field for the
  dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine
  (DPPC) molecule, the present effort was undertaken to improve this initial
  model and expand the force field to a wider range of phospholipid molecules.
  New lipids parametrized include dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC),
  dilauroylphosphatidylcholine (DLPC),
  1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC),
  1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC),
  dipalmitoylphosphatidylethanolamine (DPPE),
  1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (POPE), and
  1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DOPE). The iterative
  optimization protocol employed in this effort led to lipid models that
  achieve a good balance between reproducing quantum mechanical data on model
  compound representative of phospholipids and reproducing a range of
  experimental condensed phase properties of bilayers. A parametrization
  strategy based on a restrained ensemble\textendash maximum entropy
  methodology was used to help accurately match the experimental NMR order
  parameters in the polar headgroup region. All the parameters were developed
  to be compatible with the remainder of the Drude polarizable force field,
  which includes water, ions, proteins, DNA, and selected carbohydrates.%

    Development of the AMOEBA (atomic multipole optimized energetics for
  biomolecular simulation) force field for proteins is presented. The current
  version (AMOEBA-2013) utilizes permanent electrostatic multipole moments
  through the quadrupole at each atom, and explicitly treats polarization
  effects in various chemical and physical environments. The atomic multipole
  electrostatic parameters for each amino acid residue type are derived from
  high-level gas phase quantum mechanical calculations via a consistent and
  extensible protocol. Molecular polarizability is modeled via a Thole-style
  damped interactive induction model based upon distributed atomic
  polarizabilities. Inter- and intramolecular polarization is treated in a
  consistent fashion via the Thole model. The intramolecular polarization model
  ensures transferability of electrostatic parameters among different
  conformations, as demonstrated by the agreement between QM and AMOEBA
  electrostatic potentials, and dipole moments of dipeptides. The backbone and
  side chain torsional parameters were determined by comparing to gas-phase QM
  (RI-TRIM MP2/CBS) conformational energies of dipeptides and to statistical
  distributions from the Protein Data Bank. Molecular dynamics simulations are
  reported for short peptides in explicit water to examine their conformational
  properties in solution. Overall the calculated conformational free energies
  and J-coupling constants are consistent with PDB statistics and experimental
  NMR results, respectively. In addition, the experimental crystal structures
  of a number of proteins are well maintained during molecular dynamics (MD)
  simulation. While further calculations are necessary to fully validate the
  force field, initial results suggest the AMOEBA polarizable multipole force
  field is able to describe the structure and energetics of peptides and
  proteins, in both gas-phase and solution environments.%

    Human ubiquitin has been extensively characterized using a variety of
  experimental and computational methods and has become an important model for
  studying protein dynamics. Nevertheless, it has proven difficult to
  characterize the microsecond time scale dynamics of this protein with
  atomistic resolution. Here we use an unbiased computer simulation to describe
  the structural dynamics of ubiquitin on the picosecond to millisecond time
  scale. In the simulation, ubiquitin interconverts between a small number of
  distinct states on the microsecond to millisecond time scale. We find that
  the conformations visited by free ubiquitin in solution are very similar to
  those found various crystal structures of ubiquitin in complex with other
  proteins, a finding in line with previous experimental studies. We also
  observe weak but statistically significant correlated motions throughout the
  protein, including long-range concerted movement across the entire {$\beta$}
  sheet, consistent with recent experimental observations. We expect that the
  detailed atomistic description of ubiquitin dynamics provided by this
  unbiased simulation may be useful in interpreting current and future
  experiments on this protein.%

    Cystic fibrosis (CF) lung disease reflects the failure of airways defense
  against chronic bacterial infection. Studies of CF cultures, transgenic mice,
  and CF patients suggest that the initiating event in CF airways disease
  pathogenesis is reduced airway surface liquid (ASL) volume, i.e.,
  dehydration. CF ASL volume regulation depends on a single extracellular
  signaling system, ATP, which renders CF airways more vulnerable to
  disease-causing insults (e.g., viruses) than are normal airways, which
  regulate ASL volume by dual ATP and adenosine signaling pathways. Clinical
  studies have explored the hypothesis that treating the dehydration of CF
  airways will be therapeutically beneficial. Inhaled hypertonic saline
  osmotically draws water onto airway surfaces, improves mucus clearance and
  pulmonary function, and reduces acute exacerbations in CF patients. Thus,
  rehydration therapies may slow the progression of CF lung disease in patients
  with established bacterial infection and may prevent the onset of CF lung
  disease if initiated early in life. Copyright \textcopyright{} 2007 by Annual

    Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common autosomal recessive disorder in
  Caucasian populations. Individuals with CF have seen significant increases in
  life expectancy in the last 60 years. As a result, previously rare
  complications are now coming to light. The most common of these is cystic
  fibrosis-related diabetes (CFRD), which affects 40-50\% of CF adults. CFRD
  significantly impacts the pulmonary function and longevity of CF patients,
  yet a lack of consensus on the best methods to diagnose and treat CFRD
  remains. We begin by reviewing our understanding of the pathogenesis of CFRD,
  as emerging evidence shows the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance
  regulator (CFTR) also has important roles in the release of insulin and
  glucagon and in the protection of {$\beta$} cells from oxidative stress. We
  then discuss how current recommended methods of CFRD diagnosis are not
  appropriate, as continuous glucose monitoring becomes more effective,
  practical, and cost-effective. Finally, we evaluate emerging treatments which
  have narrowed the mortality gap within the CF patient group. In the future,
  pharmacological potentiators and correctors directly targeting CFTR show huge
  promise for both CFRD and the wider CF patient groups.%

    Cystic fibrosis is caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane
  conductance regulator (CFTR). CFTR is a member of the ATP-binding cassette
  (ABC) family of membrane transport proteins, most members of which function
  as ATP-dependent pumps. CFTR is unique among human ABC proteins in
  functioning not as a pump, but as an ion channel. Recent structural data has
  indicated that CFTR shares broadly similar overall architecture and
  ATP-dependent conformational changes as other ABC proteins. Functional
  investigations suggest that CFTR has a unique open portal connecting the
  cytoplasm to the transmembrane channel pore, that allows for a continuous
  pathway for Cl- ions to cross the membrane in one conformation. This lateral
  portal may be what allows CFTR to function as an ion channel rather than as a
  pump, suggesting a plausible mechanism by which channel function may have
  evolved in CFTR.%

    The Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (CFTR) anion
  channel is essential for epithelial salt\textendash water balance. CFTR
  mutations cause cystic fibrosis, a lethal incurable disease. In cells CFTR is
  activated through the cAMP signaling pathway, overstimulation of which during
  cholera leads to CFTR-mediated intestinal salt\textendash water loss. Channel
  activation is achieved by phosphorylation of its regulatory (R) domain by
  cAMP-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (PKA). Here we show using two
  independent approaches\textendash\textendash an ATP analog that can drive
  CFTR channel gating but is unsuitable for phosphotransfer by PKA, and CFTR
  mutants lacking phosphorylatable serines\textendash\textendash that PKA
  efficiently opens CFTR channels through simple binding, under conditions that
  preclude phosphorylation. Unlike when phosphorylation happens, CFTR
  activation by PKA binding is completely reversible. Thus, PKA binding
  promotes release of the unphosphorylated R domain from its inhibitory
  position, causing full channel activation, whereas phosphorylation serves
  only to maintain channel activity beyond termination of the PKA signal. The
  results suggest two levels of CFTR regulation in cells: irreversible through
  phosphorylation, and reversible through R-domain binding to
  PKA\textendash\textendash and possibly also to other members of a large
  network of proteins known to interact with the channel.%

    The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is an anion

  A-dependent phosphorylation. To understand the conformational changes
  elicited by phosphorylation and ATP binding, we present here the structure of
  phosphorylated, ATP-bound human CFTR, determined by cryoelectron microscopy

  Finally, the structure of CFTR provides a better understanding of why the

    The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is an anion

  this study, we determined the structure of zebrafish CFTR in the absence of

  CFTR share 55\% sequence identity, and 42 of the 46 cystic-fibrosis-causing
  missense mutational sites are identical. In CFTR, we observe a large anion
  conduction pathway lined by numerous positively charged residues. A single
  gate near the extracellular surface closes the channel. The regulatory
  domain, dephosphorylated, is located in the intracellular opening between the
  two nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs), preventing NBD dimerization and
  channel opening. The structure also reveals why many cystic-fibrosis-causing
  mutations would lead to defects either in folding, ion conduction, or gating
  and suggests new avenues for therapeutic intervention.%

    The regulatory (R) region of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance
  regulator (CFTR) is intrinsically disordered and must be phosphorylated at
  multiple sites for full CFTR channel activity, with no one specific
  phosphorylation site required. In addition, nucleotide binding and hydrolysis
  at the nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs) of CFTR are required for channel
  gating. We report NMR studies in the absence and presence of NBD1 that
  provide structural details for the isolated R region and its interaction with
  NBD1 at residue-level resolution. Several sites in the R region with measured
  fractional helical propensity mediate interactions with NBD1. Phosphorylation
  reduces the helicity of many R-region sites and reduces their NBD1
  interactions. This evidence for a dynamic complex with NBD1 that transiently
  engages different sites of the R region suggests a structural explanation for
  the dependence of CFTR activity on multiple PKA phosphorylation sites.

    \field{abstract}{%
    The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is an anion
  channel evolved from an ATP-binding cassette transporter. CFTR channel gating
  is strictly coupled to phosphorylation and ATP hydrolysis. Previously, we
  reported essentially identical structures of zebrafish and human CFTR in the
  dephosphorylated, ATP-free form. Here, we present the structure of zebrafish
  CFTR in the phosphorylated, ATP-bound conformation, determined by
  cryoelectron microscopy to 3.4 \AA{} resolution. Comparison of the two
  conformations shows major structural rearrangements leading to channel
  opening. The phosphorylated regulatory domain is disengaged from its
  inhibitory position; the nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs) form a
  ``head-to-tail'' dimer upon binding ATP; and the cytoplasmic pathway, found
  closed off in other ATP-binding cassette transporters, is cracked open,
  consistent with CFTR's unique channel function. Unexpectedly, the
  extracellular mouth of the ion pore remains closed, indicating that local
  movements of the transmembrane helices can control ion access to the pore
  even in the NBD-dimerized conformation.%

    Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has recently provided invaluable
  experimental data about the full-length cystic fibrosis transmembrane
  conductance regulator (CFTR) 3D structure. However, this experimental
  information deals with inactive states of the channel, either in an apo,
  quiescent conformation, in which nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs) are widely
  separated or in an ATP-bound, yet closed conformation. Here, we show that 3D
  structure models of the open and closed forms of the channel, now further
  supported by metadynamics simulations and by comparison with the cryo-EM
  data, could be used to gain some insights into critical features of the
  conformational transition toward active CFTR forms. These critical elements
  lie within membrane-spanning domains but also within NBD1 and the N-terminal
  extension, in which conformational plasticity is predicted to occur to help
  the interaction with filamin, one of the CFTR cellular partners.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    CFTR (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator), a member of the
  ABC (ATP-binding cassette) superfamily of membrane proteins, possesses two
  NBDs (nucleotide-binding domains) in addition to two MSDs (membrane spanning
  domains) and the regulatory 'R' domain. The two NBDs of CFTR have been
  modelled as a heterodimer, stabilized by ATP binding at two sites in the NBD
  interface. It has been suggested that ATP hydrolysis occurs at only one of
  these sites as the putative catalytic base is only conserved in NBD2 of CFTR
  (Glu 1371), but not in NBD1 where the corresponding residue is a serine,
  Ser573. Previously, we showed that fragments of CFTR corresponding to NBD1
  and NBD2 can be purified and co-reconstituted to form a heterodimer capable
  of ATPase activity. In the present study, we show that the two NBD fragments
  form a complex in vivo, supporting the utility of this model system to
  evaluate the role of Glu1371 in ATP binding and hydrolysis. The present
  studies revealed that a mutant NBD2 (E1371Q) retains wild-type nucleotide
  binding affinity of NBD2. On the other hand, this substitution abolished the
  ATPase activity formed by the co-purified complex. Interestingly,
  introduction of a glutamate residue in place of the non-conserved Ser 573 in
  NBD1 did not confer additional ATPase activity by the heterodimer,
  implicating a vital role for multiple residues in formation of the catalytic
  site. These findings provide the first biochemical evidence suggesting that
  the Walker B residue: Glu1371, plays a primary role in the ATPase activity
  conferred by the NBD1-NBD2 heterodimer. \textcopyright{} 2007 Biochemical

    Small molecule chaperones have been exploited as therapeutics for the
  hundreds of diseases caused by protein misfolding. The most successful
  examples are the CFTR correctors, which transformed cystic fibrosis therapy.
  These molecules revert folding defects of the DF508 mutant and are widely
  used to treat patients. To investigate the molecular mechanism of their
  action, we determined cryo-electron microscopy structures of CFTR in complex
  with the FDA-approved correctors lumacaftor or tezacaftor. Both drugs insert
  into a hydrophobic pocket in the first transmembrane domain (TMD1), linking
  together four helices that are thermodynamically unstable. Mutating residues
  at the binding site rendered DF508-CFTR insensitive to lumacaftor and
  tezacaftor, underscoring the functional significance of the structural
  discovery. These results support a mechanism in which the correctors
  stabilize TMD1 at an early stage of biogenesis, prevent its premature
  degradation, and thereby allosterically rescuing many disease-causing
  mutations.%

    Background: Ivacaftor (KALYDECO\texttrademark, VX-770) is a CFTR
  potentiator that increased CFTR channel activity and improved lung function
  in patients age 6. years and older with CF who have the G551D-CFTR gating
  mutation. The aim of this in vitro study was to evaluate the effect of
  ivacaftor on mutant CFTR protein forms with defects in protein processing
  and/or channel function. Methods: The effect of ivacaftor on CFTR function
  was tested in electrophysiological studies using a panel of Fischer rat
  thyroid (FRT) cells expressing 54 missense CFTR mutations that cause defects
  in the amount or function of CFTR at the cell surface. Results: Ivacaftor
  potentiated multiple mutant CFTR protein forms that produce functional CFTR
  at the cell surface. These included mutant CFTR forms with mild defects in
  CFTR processing or mild defects in CFTR channel conductance. Conclusions:
  These in vitro data indicated that ivacaftor is a broad acting CFTR
  potentiator and could be used to help stratify patients with CF who have
  different CFTR genotypes for studies investigating the potential clinical
  benefit of ivacaftor. \textcopyright{} 2013 European Cystic Fibrosis

    Significant progress has been made in the development of CFTR modulator
  therapy; however, current CFTR modulator therapies are only available for a
  minority of the CF-patient population. Additionally, heterogeneity in in vivo
  modulator response has been reported among individuals carrying homozygous
  F508del-CFTR, adding to the desire for an optimal prediction of
  response-to-therapy on an individual level. In the last decade, a lot of
  progress has been made in the development of primary cell cultures into 3D
  patient-derived disease models. The advantage of these models is that the
  endogenous CFTR function is affected by the patient's mutation as well as
  other genetic or environmental factors. In this review we focus on intestinal
  organoids as in vitro model for CF, enabling for CF disease classification,
  drug development and treatment optimization in a personalized manner, taking
  into account rare CFTR mutations and clinical heterogeneity among individuals
  with CF.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    We recently established conditions allowing for long-term expansion of
  epithelial organoids from intestine, recapitulating essential features of the
  in vivo tissue architecture. Here we apply this technology to study primary
  intestinal organoids of people suffering from cystic fibrosis, a disease
  caused by mutations in CFTR, encoding cystic fibrosis transmembrane
  conductance regulator. Forskolin induces rapid swelling of organoids derived
  from healthy controls or wild-type mice, but this effect is strongly reduced
  in organoids of subjects with cystic fibrosis or in mice carrying the Cftr
  F508del mutation and is absent in Cftr-deficient organoids. This pattern is
  phenocopied by CFTR-specific inhibitors. Forskolin-induced swelling of in
  vitro-expanded human control and cystic fibrosis organoids corresponds
  quantitatively with forskolin-induced anion currents in freshly excised ex
  vivo rectal biopsies. Function of the CFTR F508del mutant protein is restored
  by incubation at low temperature, as well as by CFTR-restoring compounds.
  This relatively simple and robust assay will facilitate diagnosis, functional
  studies, drug development and personalized medicine approaches in cystic
  fibrosis.%
