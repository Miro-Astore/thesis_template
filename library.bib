The physical properties are significantly affected by the structure of the carboxylic acid but the phase behavior of the mixtures can be simply modeled by taking account of the mole fraction of carboxylic acid in the mixture. The physical properties such as viscosity, conductivity, and surface tension of these DES are similar to ambient temperature ionic liquids and insight into the cause of these properties is gained using hole-theory. It is shown that the conductivity and viscosity of these liquids is controlled by ion mobility and the availability of voids of suitable dimensions, and this is consistent with the fluidity of other ionic liquids and molten salts. The DES are also shown to be good solvents for metal oxides, which could have potential application for metal extraction.}

PES-Learn incorporates a generalized framework for producing grid points across a PES that is compatible with most electronic structure theory software. The newly generated or externally supplied PES data can then be used to train and optimize neural network or Gaussian process models in a completely automated fashion. Robust hyperparameter optimization schemes designed specifically for molecular PES applications are implemented to ensure that the best possible model for the data set is fit with high quality. The performance of PES-Learn toward fitting a few semiglobal PESs from the literature is evaluated. We also demonstrate the use of PES-Learn machine learning models in carrying out high-level vibrational configuration interaction computations on water and formaldehyde.}

Little is known about the effect of the mutation in the isolated nucleotide binding domains (NBDs), on dimer dynamics, ATP hydrolysis and even on nucleotide binding.

  abstract = {Abstract The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is a plasma-membrane anion channel that, when mutated, causes the disease cystic fibrosis. Although CFTR has been detected in a detergent-resistant membrane fraction prepared from airway epithelial cells, suggesting that it may partition into cholesterol-rich membrane microdomains (lipid rafts), its compartmentalization has not been demonstrated in intact cells and the influence of microdomains on CFTR lateral mobility is unknown. We used live-cell imaging, spatial image correlation spectroscopy, and k-space image correlation spectroscopy to examine the aggregation state of CFTR and its dynamics both within and outside microdomains in the plasma membrane of primary human bronchial epithelial cells. These studies were also performed during treatments that augment or deplete membrane cholesterol. We found two populations of CFTR molecules that were distinguishable based on their dynamics at the cell surface. One population showed confinement and had slow dynamics that were highly cholesterol dependent. The other, more abundant population was less confined and diffused more rapidly. Treatments that deplete the membrane of cholesterol caused the confined fraction and average number of CFTR molecules per cluster to decrease. Elevating cholesterol had the opposite effect, increasing channel aggregation and the fraction of channels displaying confinement, consistent with CFTR recruitment into cholesterol-rich microdomains with dimensions below the optical resolution limit. Viral infection caused the nanoscale microdomains to fuse into large platforms and reduced CFTR mobility. To our knowledge, these results provide the first biophysical evidence for multiple CFTR populations and have implications for regulation of their surface expression and channel function.},

  abstract = {CFTR is unique among ABC transporters as the only one functioning as an ion channel and from a human health perspective because mutations in its gene cause cystic fibrosis. Although considerable advances have been made towards understanding CFTR's mechanism of action and the impact of mutations, the lack of a high-resolution 3D structure has hindered progress. The large multi-domain membrane glycoprotein is normally present at low copy number and when over expressed at high levels it aggregates strongly, limiting the production of stable mono-disperse preparations. While the reasons for the strong self-association are not fully understood, its relatively low thermal stability seems likely to be one. The major CF causing mutation, {$\Delta$}F508, renders the protein very thermally unstable and therefore a great deal of attention has been paid to this property of CFTR. Multiple second site mutations of CFTR in NBD1 where F508 normally resides and small molecule binders of the domain increase the thermal stability of the mutant. These manipulations also stabilize the wild-type protein. Here we have applied {$\Delta$}F508-stabilizing changes and other modifications to generate wild-type constructs that express at much higher levels in scaled-up suspension cultures of mammalian cells. After purification and reconstitution into liposomes these proteins are active in a locked-open conformation at temperatures as high as 50\textdegree C and remain monodisperse at 4\textdegree C in detergent or lipid for at least a week. The availability of adequate amounts of these and related stable active preparations of homogeneous CFTR will enable stalled structural and ligand binding studies to proceed.},

  abstract = {The present information explosion on the World Wide Web poses a problem for the general public and the members of an academic discipline alike, of how to find the most authoritative, comprehensive, and up-to-date information about an important topic. At the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (SEP), we have since 1995 been developing and implementing the concept of a dynamic reference work (DRW) to provide a solution to these problems, while maintaining free access for readers. A DRW is much more than a web-based encyclopedia, and its scope far exceeds that of an electronic journal or preprint exchange. In this article we document the progress of the SEP toward full implementation of the DRW concept. We discuss the fiscal challenges posed by our desire to maintain free or low-cost access to the contents of the SEP, and we consider technological challenges posed by the desire to stay abreast of technological developments in document markup while making it easy for authors and subject editors to write and maintain entries representing the very best scholarship.

Computer simulation is an essential tool in studying the chemistry and physics of condensed matter, complementing and reinforcing both experiment and theory. Simulations provide detailed information about structure and dynamics, essential to understand the many fluid systems that play a key role in our daily lives: polymers, gels, colloidal suspensions, liquid crystals, biological membranes, and glasses. The second edition of this pioneering book aims to explain how simulation programs work, how to use them, and how to interpret the results, with examples of the latest research in this rapidly evolving field. Accompanying programs in Fortran and Python provide practical, hands-on, illustrations of the ideas in the text.},

  abstract = {Science is an enormously successful human enterprise. The study ofscientific method is the attempt to discern the activities by whichthat success is achieved. Among the activities often identified ascharacteristic of science are systematic observation andexperimentation, inductive and deductive reasoning, and the formationand testing of hypotheses and theories. How these arecarried out in detail can vary greatly, but characteristics like thesehave been looked to as a way of demarcating scientific activity fromnon-science, where only enterprises which employ some canonical formof scientific method or methods should be considered science (see alsothe entry onscience and pseudo-science).  On the other hand, more recent debate has questioned whether there isanything like a fixed toolkit of methods which is common acrossscience and only science., Scientific method should be distinguished from the aims andproducts of science, such as knowledge, predictions, orcontrol. Methods are the means by which those goals areachieved. Scientific method should also be distinguished frommeta-methodology, which includes the values and justifications behinda particular characterizationof scientific method (i.e., a methodology) \textemdash values such as objectivity, reproducibility, simplicity,or past successes. Methodological rules are proposed to govern methodand it is a meta-methodological question whether methods obeying thoserules satisfy given values.  Finally, method is distinct, to some degree, fromthe detailed and contextual practices through which methods areimplemented. The latter might range over: specific laboratorytechniques; mathematical formalisms or other specialized languagesused in descriptions and reasoning; technological or other materialmeans; ways of communicating and sharing results, whether with otherscientists or with the public at large; or the conventions, habits,enforced customs, and institutional controls over how and what scienceis carried out., While it is important to recognize these distinctions, theirboundaries are fuzzy. Hence, accounts of method cannot be entirelydivorced from their methodological and meta-methodological motivationsor justifications, Moreover, each aspect plays a crucial role inidentifying methods. Disputes about method have therefore played outat the detail, rule, and meta-rule levels. Changes in beliefs aboutthe certainty or fallibility of scientific knowledge, for instance(which is a meta-methodological consideration of what we can hope formethods to deliver), have meant different emphases on deductive andinductive reasoning, or on the relative importance attached toreasoning over observation (i.e., differences over particularmethods.) Beliefs about the role of science in society will affect theplace one gives to values in scientific method. , The issue which has shaped debates over scientific method the most inthe last half century is the question of how pluralist do we need to beabout method? Unificationists continue to hold out for one methodessential to science; nihilism is a form of radical pluralism, whichconsiders the effectiveness of any methodological prescription to beso context sensitive as to render it not explanatory on its own. Somemiddle degree of pluralism regarding the methods embodied inscientific practice seems appropriate. But the details of scientificpractice vary with time and place, from institution toinstitution, across scientists and their subjects ofinvestigation. How significant are the variations for understandingscience and its success? How much can method be abstracted frompractice? This entry describes some of the attempts tocharacterize scientific method or methods, as well as arguments for a morecontext-sensitive approach to methods embedded in actual scientificpractices.},

Biblical laws, including these two examples, continue to influence Christian (especially Protestant) attitudes toward women, homosexuals, the poor, as well as those who are from different faiths or racial/ethnic origins. This book argues that such ancient laws and the corresponding contemporary attitudes ignore the harm caused to such groups and fail to consider that these groups may have different, yet valid, perspectives on the meaning of these texts. Specifically, this book argues that the Christian tradition has become inseparable from a privileged male perspective not reflecting the full range of persons found in its faith communities. Furthermore, it is this male norm that has historically established the accepted singular and determinative meaning of any given biblical text. Contemporary controversies about biblical interpretation, then, result from those other groups acknowledging that their realities differ from the putative norm and offering their own interpretations of problematic biblical texts. The book finds that inclusive biblical interpretation and its consideration of these normally excluded perspectives are consistent with the Christian tradition. This work advances support for inclusive interpretation from the Bible (both Old and New Testaments)-from the Protestant tradition itself, based on the writings of Martin Luther, John Calvin, and John Wesley-and from parallels with the interpretation and amendment of the U.S. Constitution.},

  abstract = {Ion-specific solvation has fundamental implications in biochemistry, and the thermodynamics and dynamics of aqueous salt solutions have correspondingly been investigated intensively. Nonetheless, there are fundamental unresolved issues in modeling the dynamics of aqueous salt solutions and the related problem of polymers dissolved in these solutions. In particular, experiments show that the self-diffusion coefficient, D, of water molecules in electrolyte solutions can be either enhanced or suppressed by particular salts having the same valence where the observed changes correlate with the Hofmeister series governing the relative solubility of proteins and water-soluble polymers in the same salt solutions. Recent studies have demonstrated that common atomistic models of aqueous electrolyte solutions completely fail to reproduce this basic phenomenon. Drawing on similar trends observed in the field of polymer nanocomposites, we propose a coarse-grained model of aqueous electrolyte solutions that captures the observed trends and that offers physical insight into the influence of salt on the thermodynamic and dynamic properties of electrolyte solutions.}

However, no theoretical framework currently exists that describes these property changes in an internally consistent fashion. In previous work, we developed a coarse-grained model of electrolyte solutions capable of reproducing basic trends on how salts influence the viscosity and water diffusion coefficient. The present work explores the predictions of this model for basic thermodynamic properties of electrolyte solutions, namely, the density, isothermal compressibility, and surface tension. On the basis of our model, we find that ion-specific effects on thermodynamics properties, and by extension the dynamics of electrolyte solutions, derive primarily from ion solvation.}

  abstract = {Ion-specific solvation has fundamental implications in biochemistry, and the thermodynamics and dynamics of aqueous salt solutions have correspondingly been investigated intensively. Nonetheless, there are fundamental unresolved issues in modeling the dynamics of aqueous salt solutions and the related problem of polymers dissolved in these solutions. In particular, experiments show that the self-diffusion coefficient, D, of water molecules in electrolyte solutions can be either enhanced or suppressed by particular salts having the same valence where the observed changes correlate with the Hofmeister series governing the relative solubility of proteins and water-soluble polymers in the same salt solutions. Recent studies have demonstrated that common atomistic models of aqueous electrolyte solutions completely fail to reproduce this basic phenomenon. Drawing on similar trends observed in the field of polymer nanocomposites, we propose a coarse-grained model of aqueous electrolyte solutions that captures the observed trends and that offers physical insight into the influence of salt on the thermodynamic and dynamic properties of electrolyte solutions.}

  abstract = {It is widely appreciated that the addition of salts to water leads to significant changes in the thermodynamic and dynamic properties of these aqueous solutions that have great significance in biology and manufacturing applications. However, no theoretical framework currently exists that describes these property changes in an internally consistent fashion. In previous work, we developed a coarse-grained model of electrolyte solutions capable of reproducing basic trends on how salts influence the viscosity and water diffusion coefficient. The present work explores the predictions of this model for basic thermodynamic properties of electrolyte solutions, namely, the density, isothermal compressibility, and surface tension. On the basis of our model, we find that ion-specific effects on thermodynamics properties, and by extension the dynamics of electrolyte solutions, derive primarily from ion solvation.}

R-FEP-R 2.0 is a generalization of the method called restrain-free energy perturbation-release (R-FEP-R) that can only estimate conformational free energy changes of protein side chains but not loops. The reorganization of protein loops is a central feature of many biological processes. Unlike other advanced sampling algorithms such as umbrella sampling and metadynamics, R-FEP-R and R-FEP-R 2.0 do not require predetermined collective coordinates and transition pathways that connect the two endpoint conformational states. The R-FEP-R 2.0 method was applied to estimate the conformational free energy change of a {$\beta$}-turn flip in the protein Ubiquitin. The result obtained by R-FEP-R 2.0 agrees with the benchmarks very well. We also comment on problems commonly encountered when applying umbrella sampling to calculate protein conformational free energy changes.,},

  abstract = {Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) are progressive neurodegenerative disorders marked in most cases by the nuclear exclusion and cytoplasmic deposition of the RNA binding protein TDP43. We previously demonstrated that ALS-associated mutant TDP43 accumulates within the cytoplasm, and that TDP43 mislocalization predicts neurodegeneration. Here, we sought to prevent neurodegeneration in ALS/FTD models using selective inhibitor of nuclear export (SINE) compounds that target exportin-1 (XPO1). SINE compounds modestly extend cellular survival in neuronal ALS/FTD models and mitigate motor symptoms in an in vivo rat ALS model. At high doses, SINE compounds block nuclear egress of an XPO1 cargo reporter, but not at lower concentrations that were associated with neuroprotection. Neither SINE compounds nor leptomycin B, a separate XPO1 inhibitor, enhanced nuclear TDP43 levels, while depletion of XPO1 or other exportins had little effect on TDP43 localization, suggesting that no single exporter is necessary for TDP43 export. Supporting this hypothesis, we find overexpression of XPO1, XPO7 and NXF1 are each sufficient to promote nuclear TDP43 egress. Taken together, our results indicate that redundant pathways regulate TDP43 nuclear export, and that therapeutic prevention of cytoplasmic TDP43 accumulation in ALS/FTD may be enhanced by targeting several overlapping mechanisms.},

Peptide segments that include the characteristic histidine (His) diad, His(13) and His(14), efficiently block the Abeta channel activity, blocking Abeta cytotoxicity. We hypothesize that the vicinal His-His peptides coordinate with the rings of His in the mouth of the pore, thus blocking the flow of calcium ions through the channel, with consequent blocking of Abeta cytotoxicity. To test this hypothesis, we studied Abeta ion channel activity and cytotoxicity after the addition of compounds that are known to have His association capacity, such as Ni(2+), imidazole, His, and a series of His-related compounds. All compounds were effective at blocking both Abeta channel and preventing Abeta cytotoxicity. The efficiency of protection of His-related compounds was correlated with the number of imidazole side chains in the blocker compounds. These data reinforce the premise that His residues within the Abeta channel sequence are in the pathway of ion flow. Additionally, the data confirm the contribution of the Abeta channel to the cytotoxicity of exogenous Abeta.},

Herein, the pairwise interactions of the constituent components of the choline chloride-urea DES are examined. Evidence is found for a tripodal CH{$\cdots$}Cl doubly ionic H-bond motif. Moreover it is found that the covalency of doubly ionic H-bonds can be greater than, or comparable with, neutral and ionic examples. In contrast to many traditional solvents, an alphabet soup of many different types of H-bond (OH{$\cdots$}OC, NH...OC, OH...Cl, NH...Cl, OH...NH, CH...Cl, CH...OC, NH...OH and NH...NH) can form. These H-bonds exhibit substantial flexibility in terms of number and strength. It is anticipated that H-bonding will have a significant impact on the entropy of the system and thus could play an important role in the formation of the eutectic. The 2:1 urea:choline-chloride eutectic point of this DES is often associated with the formation of a [Cl(urea)2]- complexed anion. However, urea is found to form a H-bonded urea[choline]+ complexed cation that is energetically competitive with [Cl(urea)2]-. The negative charge on [Cl(urea)2]- is found to remain localised on the chloride, moreover, the urea[choline]+ complexed cation forms the strongest H-bond studied here. Thus, there is potential to consider a urea[choline]+{$\cdot$}urea[Cl]- interaction.}

Likewise, the dynamic properties of the involved molecules at the metal surfaces are quantified through selfdiffusion coefficients and compared with the behavior in the bulk liquid phases. Strong preferential adsorption at the metal surfaces by the molecules forming the deep eutectic solvents is inferred, which characteristics are analyzed as a function of the type of metal, the strength on metal-solvent interactions, and the changes in the nanoscopic properties of the solvent upon adsorption.

The densification, molecular arrangements and orientations, and electronic density at the metal interfaces are analyzed. Likewise, the dynamic properties of the involved molecules at the metal surfaces are quantified through selfdiffusion coefficients and compared with the behavior in the bulk liquid phases. Strong preferential adsorption at the metal surfaces by the molecules forming the deep eutectic solvents is inferred, which characteristics are analyzed as a function of the type of metal, the strength on metal-solvent interactions, and the changes in the nanoscopic properties of the solvent upon adsorption. The reported results show for the very first time the characteristics of metal-deep eutectic solvent hybrid materials.}

This study was undertaken to explore the importance of truncation effects in simulations involving charged species which employ cut-offs at longer range than typically used in MD. Artefacts were discerned in the ion-ion radial distribution functions at {$\approx$} 16 \AA, indicating that increasing the length scale of the truncation scheme does not necessarily lead to reliable trajectories. Our results indicate that `charge group-charge group' radial distribution functions are a sensitive test for the detection of artefacts due to truncation and it is suggested that they should be used as a routine screening device in the analysis of MD systems involving charged groups.},

  abstract = {The time step of atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations is determined by the fastest motions in the system and is typically limited to 2 fs. An increasingly popular solution is to increase the mass of the hydrogen atoms to \textasciitilde 3 amu and decrease the mass of the parent atom by an equivalent amount. This approach, known as hydrogen-mass repartitioning (HMR), permits time steps up to 4 fs with reasonable simulation stability. While HMR has been applied in many published studies to date, it has not been extensively tested for membrane-containing systems. Here, we compare the results of simulations of a variety of membranes and membrane-protein systems run using a 2-fs time step and a 4-fs time step with HMR. For pure membrane systems, we find almost no difference in structural properties, such as area-per-lipid, electron density profiles, and order parameters, although there are differences in kinetic properties such as the diffusion constant. Conductance through a porin in an applied field, partitioning of a small peptide, hydrogen-bond dynamics, and membrane mixing show very little dependence on HMR and the time step. We also tested a 9-\AA{} cutoff compared to the standard CHARMM cutoff of 12 \AA, finding significant deviations in many properties tested. We conclude that HMR is a valid approach for membrane systems but a 9-\AA{} cutoff is not.,},

We show that the boundary and its curvature are the crucial factors in determining how an ion's potential energy depends on the dielectric constants near an interface. The potential energy of an ion outside a globular protein has a dominant 1/{$\epsilon$}w dependence, but this becomes 1/{$\epsilon$}p for an ion inside a cavity. For channels, where the boundaries are in between these two extremes, the situation is more complex. In general, we find that variations in {$\epsilon$}w have a much larger impact on the potential energy of an ion compared to those in {$\epsilon$}p. Therefore a better understanding of the effective {$\epsilon$}w values employed in channel models is desirable. Although the precise value of {$\epsilon$}p is not a crucial determinant of ion permeation properties, it still needs to be chosen carefully when quantitative comparisons with data are made.}

A powerful technique in the biologist's toolkit, digital assays bring a new level of precision in quantifying nucleic acids, measuring proteins and their enzymatic activity, and probing single-cell genotypes and phenotypes. Part I of this review begins with the benefits and Poisson statistics of partitioning, including sources of error. The remainder focuses on digital PCR (dPCR) for quantification of nucleic acids. We discuss five commercial instruments that partition samples into physically isolated chambers (cdPCR) or droplet emulsions (ddPCR). We compare the strengths of dPCR (absolute quantitation, precision, and ability to detect rare or mutant targets) with those of its predecessor, quantitative real-time PCR (dynamic range, larger sample volumes, and throughput). Lastly, we describe several promising applications of dPCR, including copy number variation, quantitation of circulating tumor DNA and viral load, RNA/miRNA quantitation with reverse transcription dPCR, and library preparation for next-generation sequencing. This review is intended to give a broad perspective to scientists interested in adopting digital assays into their workflows. Part II focuses on digital protein and cell assays.},

The positions of many H atoms can be inferred by our chemical knowledge, and such H atoms can be added with confidence in 'riding positions'. For some chemical groups, however, there is more ambiguity over the possible hydrogen placements, for example hydroxyls and groups that can exist in multiple protonation states or tautomeric forms. This ambiguity is far from rare, since about 25\% of drugs have more than one tautomeric form. This paper focuses on the most common, 'prototropic', tautomers, which are isomers that readily interconvert by the exchange of an H atom accompanied by the switch of a single and an adjacent double bond. Hydrogen-exchange rates and different protonation states of compounds (e.g. buffers) are also briefly discussed. The difference in heavy (non-H) atom positions between two tautomers can be small, and careful refinement of all possible tautomers may single out the likely bound ligand tautomer. Experimental methods to determine H-atom positions, such as neutron crystallography, are often technically challenging. Therefore, chemical knowledge and computational approaches are frequently used in conjugation with experimental data to deduce the bound tautomer state. Proton movement is a key feature of many enzymatic reactions, so understanding the orchestration of hydrogen/proton motion is of critical importance to biological chemistry. For example, structural studies have suggested that, just as a chemist may use heat, some enzymes use directional movement to protonate specific O atoms on phosphates to catalyse phosphotransferase reactions. To inhibit 'wriggly' enzymes that use movement to effect catalysis, it may be advantageous to have inhibitors that can maintain favourable contacts by adopting different tautomers as the enzyme 'wriggles'.H atoms are 'hard to see' in X-ray crystal structures of protein-ligand complexes. This paper discusses the problem of identifying the correct tautomeric form(s) of protein-bound ligands.},

The difference in heavy (non-H) atom positions between two tautomers can be small, and careful refinement of all possible tautomers may single out the likely bound ligand tautomer. Experimental methods to determine H-atom positions, such as neutron crystallography, are often technically challenging. Therefore, chemical knowledge and computational approaches are frequently used in conjugation with experimental data to deduce the bound tautomer state. Proton movement is a key feature of many enzymatic reactions, so understanding the orchestration of hydrogen/proton motion is of critical importance to biological chemistry. For example, structural studies have suggested that, just as a chemist may use heat, some enzymes use directional movement to protonate specific O atoms on phosphates to catalyse phosphotransferase reactions. To inhibit 'wriggly' enzymes that use movement to effect catalysis, it may be advantageous to have inhibitors that can maintain favourable contacts by adopting different tautomers as the enzyme 'wriggles'.H atoms are 'hard to see' in X-ray crystal structures of protein-ligand complexes. This paper discusses the problem of identifying the correct tautomeric form(s) of protein-bound ligands.},

  abstract = {Skolem's Paradox involves a seeming conflict between two theoremsfrom classical logic. The L\"owenheim-Skolem theorem says that if afirst-order theory has infinite models, then it has models whosedomains are only countable. Cantor's theorem says that some sets areuncountable. Skolem's Paradox arises when we notice that the basicprinciples of Cantorian set theory\textemdash i.e., the very principles usedto prove Cantor's theorem on the existence of uncountablesets\textemdash can themselves be formulated as a collection of first-ordersentences. How can the very principles which prove the existence ofuncountable sets be satisfied by a model which is itself onlycountable? How can a countable model satisfy the first-order sentencewhich says that there are uncountably many mathematicalobjects\textemdash e.g., uncountably many real numbers?, Philosophical discussion of this paradox has tended to focus onthree main questions. First, there's a purely mathematical question:why doesn't Skolem's Paradox introduce an outright contradiction intoset theory? Second, there's a historical question. Skolem himself gavea pretty good explanation as to why Skolem's Paradox doesn't constitutea straightforward mathematical contradiction; why, then, did Skolem andhis contemporaries continue to find the paradox so philosophicallytroubling? Finally there's a purely philosophical question: what, ifanything, does Skolem's Paradox tell us about our understanding of settheory and/or about the semantics of set-theoretic language?},

The method is easily extendable to other variables and to gradients, and can be applied also to polyatomic molecules involving internal constraints.

  abstract = {During neurodegenerative disease, the multifunctional RNA-binding protein TDP-43 undergoes a vast array of post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, acetylation, and cleavage. Many of these alterations may directly contribute to the pathogenesis of TDP-43 proteinopathies, which include most forms of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and approximately half of all frontotemporal dementia, pathologically identified as frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) with TDP-43 pathology. However, the relative contributions of the various TDP-43 post-translational modifications to disease remain unclear, and indeed some may be secondary epiphenomena rather than disease-causative. It is therefore critical to determine the involvement of each modification in disease processes to allow the design of targeted treatments. In particular, TDP-43 C-terminal fragments (CTFs) accumulate in the brains of people with ALS and FTLD and are therefore described as a neuropathological signature of these diseases. Remarkably, these TDP-43 CTFs are rarely observed in the spinal cord, even in ALS which involves dramatic degeneration of spinal motor neurons. Therefore, TDP-43 CTFs are not produced non-specifically in the course of all forms of TDP-43-related neurodegeneration, but rather variably arise due to additional factors influenced by regional heterogeneity in the central nervous system. In this review, we summarize how TDP-43 CTFs are generated and degraded by cells, and critique evidence from studies of TDP-43 CTF pathology in human disease tissues, as well as cell and animal models, to analyze the pathophysiological relevance of TDP-43 CTFs to ALS and FTLD. Numerous studies now indicate that, although TDP-43 CTFs are prevalent in ALS and FTLD brains, disease-related pathology is only variably reproduced in TDP-43 CTF cell culture models. Furthermore, TDP-43 CTF expression in both transgenic and viral-mediated in vivo models largely fails to induce motor or behavioral dysfunction reminiscent of human disease. We therefore conclude that although TDP-43 CTFs are a hallmark of TDP-43-related neurodegeneration in the brain, they are not a primary cause of ALS or FTLD.},

Methods: The study was a single-center, comparative, randomized, crossover, Phase I study in 24 healthy adults. Each participant received six injections in the abdomen area of either a 2 or 3 mL placebo solution, with three different fluid viscosities (1, 8\textendash 10, and 15\textendash 20 cP) combined with two different injection flow rates (0.02 and 0.3 mL/s). All injections were performed with 50 mL syringes and 27G, 6 mm needles. Perceived injection pain was assessed using a 100 mm visual analog scale (VAS) (0 mm/no pain, 100 mm/extreme pain). The location and depth of the injected fluid was assessed through 2D ultrasound echography images. Results: Viscosity levels had significant impact on perceived injection pain (P=0.0003). Specifically, less pain was associated with high viscosity (VAS =12.6 mm) than medium (VAS =16.6 mm) or low (VAS =22.1 mm) viscosities, with a significant difference between high and low viscosities (P=0.0002). Target injection volume of 2 or 3 mL was demonstrated to have no significant impact on perceived injection pain (P=0.89). Slow (0.02 mL/s) or fast (0.30 mL/s) injection rates also showed no significant impact on perceived pain during SC injection (P=0.79). In 92\% of injections, the injected fluid was located exclusively in SC tissue whereas the remaining injected fluids were found located in SC and/or intradermal layers. Conclusion: The results of this study suggest that solutions of up to 3 mL and up to 15\textendash 20 cP injected into the abdomen within 10 seconds are well tolerated without pain. High viscosity injections were shown to be the most tolerated, whereas injection volume and flow rates did not impact perceived pain.},

Each participant received six injections in the abdomen area of either a 2 or 3 mL placebo solution, with three different fluid viscosities (1, 8\textendash 10, and 15\textendash 20 cP) combined with two different injection flow rates (0.02 and 0.3 mL/s). All injections were performed with 50 mL syringes and 27G, 6 mm needles. Perceived injection pain was assessed using a 100 mm visual analog scale (VAS) (0 mm/no pain, 100 mm/extreme pain). The location and depth of the injected fluid was assessed through 2D ultrasound echography images. Results: Viscosity levels had significant impact on perceived injection pain (P=0.0003). Specifically, less pain was associated with high viscosity (VAS =12.6 mm) than medium (VAS =16.6 mm) or low (VAS =22.1 mm) viscosities, with a significant difference between high and low viscosities (P=0.0002). Target injection volume of 2 or 3 mL was demonstrated to have no significant impact on perceived injection pain (P=0.89). Slow (0.02 mL/s) or fast (0.30 mL/s) injection rates also showed no significant impact on perceived pain during SC injection (P=0.79). In 92\% of injections, the injected fluid was located exclusively in SC tissue whereas the remaining injected fluids were found located in SC and/or intradermal layers. Conclusion: The results of this study suggest that solutions of up to 3 mL and up to 15\textendash 20 cP injected into the abdomen within 10 seconds are well tolerated without pain. High viscosity injections were shown to be the most tolerated, whereas injection volume and flow rates did not impact perceived pain.},

In a previous study we reported the occurrence of activating somatic mutations of G{$\alpha$}s, which transduces mitogenic signals, in 30\% of the analyzed JGCTs. Methods: We have searched for alterations in other proteins involved in ovarian mitogenic signaling. We focused on the PI3K-AKT axis. As we found mutations in AKT1, we analyzed the subcellular localization of the mutated proteins and performed functional explorations using Western-blot and luciferase assays. Findings: We detected in-frame duplications affecting the pleckstrin-homology domain of AKT1 in more than 60\% of the tumors occurring in girls under 15 years of age. The somatic status of the mutations was confirmed when peritumoral DNA was available. The JGCTs without duplications carried point mutations affecting highly conserved residues. Several of these substitutions were somatic lesions. The mutated proteins carrying the duplications had a non-wild-type subcellular distribution, with a marked enrichment at the plasma membrane. This led to a striking degree of AKT1 activation demonstrated by a strong phosphorylation level and by reporter assays. Interpretation: Our study incriminates somatic mutations of AKT1 as a major event in the pathogenesis of JGCTs.

  abstract = {Viruses are intracellular parasites that hijack the cellular machinery for their own replication. Therefore, an obligatory step in the virus life cycle is the delivery of the viral genome inside the cell. Enveloped viruses (i.e., viruses with a lipid envelope) use a two-step procedure to release their genetic material into the cell: (i) they first bind to specific surface receptors of the target cell membrane and then, (ii) they fuse the viral and cell membranes. This last step may occur at the cell surface or after internalization of the virus particle by endocytosis or by some other route (e.g., macropinocytosis). Remarkably, the virus-cell membrane fusion process goes essentially along the same intermediate steps as other membrane fusions that occur for instance in vesicular fusion at the nerve synapsis or cell-cell fusion in yeast mating. Specialized viral proteins, fusogens, promote virus-cell membrane fusion. The viral fusogens experience drastic structural rearrangements during fusion, liberating the energy required to overcome the repulsive forces that prevent spontaneous fusion of the two membranes. This chapter describes the different types of viral fusogens and their mode of action, as are currently known.},

  abstract = {Cystic fibrosis (CF) lung disease reflects the failure of airways defense against chronic bacterial infection. Studies of CF cultures, transgenic mice, and CF patients suggest that the initiating event in CF airways disease pathogenesis is reduced airway surface liquid (ASL) volume, i.e., dehydration. CF ASL volume regulation depends on a single extracellular signaling system, ATP, which renders CF airways more vulnerable to disease-causing insults (e.g., viruses) than are normal airways, which regulate ASL volume by dual ATP and adenosine signaling pathways. Clinical studies have explored the hypothesis that treating the dehydration of CF airways will be therapeutically beneficial. Inhaled hypertonic saline osmotically draws water onto airway surfaces, improves mucus clearance and pulmonary function, and reduces acute exacerbations in CF patients. Thus, rehydration therapies may slow the progression of CF lung disease in patients with established bacterial infection and may prevent the onset of CF lung disease if initiated early in life.

METHODS: Thirty-two patients were treated for anorexia nervosa on an inpatient unit, and were assessed before and after treatment. The inpatient milieu was designed to use cognitive therapy as the primary therapeutic intervention, along with weight restoration. RESULTS: At discharge, all patients displayed significant change in core eating disorder psychopathology in their depressive symptoms, as well as in general aspects of psychopathology. At one-year follow-up, changes in some areas of core eating disorder psychopathology and depressive symptoms continued to be significantly different than from admissions. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of CBT and weight restoration can significantly reduce eating disorder symptoms, depression, and general psychopathology during hospitalization, with some sustained benefit over a one year period. Future research is needed to identify the effect of CBT on anorexia nervosa during a wide variety of treatment settings. Also, research must focus on the influence of outpatient treatment in the outcome of anorexia nervosa.},

We performed NMR, CD, and fluorescence binding studies on the nonphosphorylated and highly PKA-phosphorylated human cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) regulatory region, a {$\sim$}200-residue disordered segment involved in phosphorylation- dependent regulation of channel trafficking and gating. Our data provide evidence for dynamic, phosphorylation-dependent, multisite interactions of various segments of the regulatory region for its intra- and intermolecular partners, including the CFTR nucleotide binding domains 1 and 2, a 42-residue peptide from the C terminus of CFTR, the SLC26A3 sulphate transporter and antisigma factor antagonist (STAS) domain, and 14-3-3{$\beta$}. Because of its large number of binding partners, multivalent binding of individually weak sites facilitates rapid exchange between free and bound states to allow the regulatory region to engage with different partners and generate a graded or rheostat-like response to phosphorylation. Our results enrich the understanding of how disordered binding segments interact with multiple targets. We present structural models consistent with our data that illustrate this dynamic aspect of phospho-regulation of CFTR by the disordered regulatory region.}

  abstract = {The binding of zinc (Zn) ions to proteins is important for many cellular events. The theoretical and computational description of this binding (as well as that of other transition metals) is a challenging task. In this paper the binding of the Zn ion to four cysteine residues in the structural site of horse liver alcohol dehydrogenase (HLADH) is studied using a synthetic peptide mimic of this site. The study includes experimental measurements of binding constants, classical free energy calculations from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and quantum mechanical (QM) electron structure calculations. The classical MD results account for interactions at the molecular level and reproduce the absolute binding energy and the hydration free energy of the Zn ion with an accuracy of about 10\%. This is insufficient to obtain correct free energy differences. QM correction terms were calculated from density functional theory (DFT) on small clusters of atoms to include electronic polarisation of the closest waters and covalent contributions to the Zn-S coordination bond. This results in reasonably good agreement with the experimentally measured binding constants and Zn ion hydration free energies in agreement with published experimental values. The study also includes the replacement of one cysteine residue to an alanine. Simulations as well as experiments showed only a small effect of this upon the binding free energy. A detailed analysis indicate that the sulfur is replaced by three water molecules, thereby changing the coordination number of Zn from four (as in the original peptide) to six (as in water). \textcopyright{} the Owner Societies.}

They introduce two variables that are able to describe the position of a point in configurational space relative to a preassigned path. With the help of these two variables the authors combine features of approaches such as metadynamics or umbrella sampling with those of path based methods. This allows global searches in the space of paths to be performed and a new variational principle for the determination of low free energy paths to be established. Contrary to metadynamics or umbrella sampling the path can be described by an arbitrary large number of variables, still the energy profile along the path can be calculated. The authors exemplify the method numerically by studying the conformational changes of alanine dipeptide. \textcopyright{} 2007 American Institute of Physics.},

Finally, we demonstrate that neddylation promotes Ku ubiquitylation after DNA damage and release of Ku and Ku-associated proteins from damage sites following repair.

  abstract = {Nominalism about mathematics (or mathematical nominalism) is the view according to which either mathematical objects, relations, and structures do not exist at all, or they do not exist as abstract objects (they are neither located in space-time nor do they have causal powers). In the latter case, some suitable concrete replacement for mathematical objects is provided. Broadly speaking, there are two forms of mathematical nominalism: those views that require the reformulation of mathematical (or scientific) theories in order to avoid the commitment to mathematical objects (e.g., Field 1980; Hellman 1989), and those views that do not reformulate mathematical or scientific theories and offer instead an account of how no commitment to mathematical objects is involved when these theories are used (e.g., Azzouni 2004). Both forms of nominalism are examined, and they are assessed in light of how they address five central problems in the philosophy of mathematics (namely, problems dealing with the epistemology, the ontology, and the application of mathematics as well as the use of a uniform semantics and the proviso that mathematical and scientific theories be taken literally).},

It is based on iteratively `filling' the potential energy of the system by a sum of Gaussians centred along the trajectory followed by a suitably chosen set of collective variables (CVs), thereby forcing the system to migrate from one minimum to the next. The power of metadynamics is demonstrated by the large number of extensions and variants that have been developed. The first scope of this Technical Review is to present a critical comparison of these variants, discussing their advantages and disadvantages. The effectiveness of metadynamics, and that of the numerous alternative methods, is strongly influenced by the choice of the CVs. If an important variable is neglected, the resulting estimate of the free energy is unreliable, and predicted transition mechanisms may be qualitatively wrong. The second scope of this Technical Review is to discuss how the CVs should be selected, how to verify whether the chosen CVs are sufficient or redundant, and how to iteratively improve the CVs using machine learning approaches.},

  abstract = {Accurate methods to estimate free energies play an important role for studying diverse condensed-phase problems in chemistry and biochemistry. The most common methods used in conjunction with molecular dynamics (MD) and Monte Carlo statistical mechanics (MC) simulations are free energy perturbation (FEP) and thermodynamic integration (TI). For common applications featuring the conversion of one molecule to another, simulations are run in stages or multiple "{$\lambda$}-windows" to promote convergence of the results. For computation of absolute free energies of solvation or binding, calculations are needed in which the solute is typically annihilated in the solvent and in the complex. The present work addresses identification of optimal protocols for such calculations, specifically, the creation/annihilation of organic molecules in aqueous solution. As is common practice, decoupling of the perturbations for electrostatic and Lennard-Jones interactions was performed. Consistent with earlier reports, FEP calculations for molecular creations are much more efficient, while annihilations require many more windows and may converge to incorrect values. Strikingly, we find that as few as four windows may be adequate for creation calculations for solutes ranging from argon to ethylbenzene. For a larger druglike molecule, MIF180, which contains 22 non-hydrogen atoms and three rotatable bonds, 10 creation windows are found to be adequate to yield the correct free energy of hydration. Convergence is impeded with procedures that use any sampling in the annihilation direction, and there is no need for postprocessing methods such as the Bennett acceptance ratio (BAR).}

In two cases, the stenosis was found out during the removal of the cannula and in the other cases from 3 days to 8 months after the decannulation. The deffered treatment consisted in an anti-inflammatory medical treatment treatment (one case), in a permanent dilation with an Albouker tube (two cases), and in a resection of the stenosed tracheal part plus an anastomosis. Good results were obtained in 9 cases including the recovery of a satisfactory tracheal diameter. Because of a recurrence of the stenosis after resection and anastomosis, it was necessary, in two cases, to resort to another resection and, upon another occasion, to place a permanent cannulation. Finally, in one case, 2 Rethi operations were necessary to get a sub-normal tracheal diameter. From these facts, it emerges that tracheal stenosis are less important if, during the tracheotomy, a partial resection of the tracheal wall is effected (rather than an inverted U flap folded back at the bottom) together with the putting in of a cannula equipped with an elongated cylindrical cuff requiring a less important filing-up pressure (although just as efficient as far as tightness is concerned).},

Wemake use of molecular dynamics simulations of Protein L in water, in urea, and in guanidinium chloride (GdmCl) to ascertain if there are any structural differences in the associated unfolding processes. The simulation of proteins in solutions of GdmCl is complicated by the large number of charges involved, making it difficult to set up a realistic force field. Furthermore, at high concentrations of this denaturant, the motion of the solvent slows considerably. The simulations show that the unfolding mechanism depends on the denaturing agent: in urea the {$\beta$}-sheet is destabilized first, whereas in GdmCl, it is the {$\alpha$}-helix. Moreover, whereas urea interacts with the protein accumulating in the first solvation shell, GdmCl displays a longer-range electrostatic effect that does not perturb the structure of the solvent close to the protein. \textcopyright{} 2008 by the Biophysical Society.}

The histopathological presence of misfolded protein (MP) aggregates has been associated as the primary evidence of multiple neurological diseases, including Prion diseases, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease. However, the exact mechanisms of MP aggregation and propagation, as well as their impact in the long-term patient's clinical condition are still not well understood. With this aim, a variety of mathematical models has been proposed for a better insight into the kinetic rate laws that govern the microscopic processes of protein aggregation. Complementary, another class of large-scale models rely on modern molecular imaging techniques for describing the phenomenological effects of MP propagation over the whole brain. Unfortunately, those neuroimaging-based studies do not take full advantage of the tremendous capabilities offered by the chemical kinetics modeling approach. Actually, it has been barely acknowledged that the vast majority of large-scale models have foundations on previous mathematical approaches that describe the chemical kinetics of protein replication and propagation. The purpose of the current manuscript is to present a historical review about the development of mathematical models for describing both microscopic processes that occur during the MP aggregation and large-scale events that characterize the progression of neurodegenerative MP-mediated diseases.},

  abstract = {Protein misfolding refers to a process where proteins become structurally abnormal and lose their specific 3-dimensional spatial configuration. The histopathological presence of misfolded protein (MP) aggregates has been associated as the primary evidence of multiple neurological diseases, including Prion diseases, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease. However, the exact mechanisms of MP aggregation and propagation, as well as their impact in the long-term patient's clinical condition are still not well understood. With this aim, a variety of mathematical models has been proposed for a better insight into the kinetic rate laws that govern the microscopic processes of protein aggregation. Complementary, another class of large-scale models rely on modern molecular imaging techniques for describing the phenomenological effects of MP propagation over the whole brain. Unfortunately, those neuroimaging-based studies do not take full advantage of the tremendous capabilities offered by the chemical kinetics modeling approach. Actually, it has been barely acknowledged that the vast majority of large-scale models have foundations on previous mathematical approaches that describe the chemical kinetics of protein replication and propagation. The purpose of the current manuscript is to present a historical review about the development of mathematical models for describing both microscopic processes that occur during the MP aggregation and large-scale events that characterize the progression of neurodegenerative MP-mediated diseases.},

We show that the use of the experimental value for the static dielectric constant in the calculations, instead of the one predicted by the different models, yields satisfactory results for the dielectric spectra, and hence the heat absorbed from microwaves, avoiding the need for extraordinarily long simulations or re-calibration of molecular models.},

Using the CO2 solubility in eicosane as benchmark, it will be shown that there is no evidence that ILs display a physical sorption of CO2 larger than n-alkanes when analyzed in adequate concentration units; the fluorination of the ions has no impact on the CO2 solubility and the oxygenation will marginally contribute to a decrease of the solubility. Ionic liquid-based deep eutectic systems are also shown to have a poor CO2 solubility. Although these widely used approaches to physically enhance the CO2 solubility in ILs do not seem to have any positive influence, this does not mean that other types of interaction cannot provide enhanced CO2 solubility as in the case of the anion [B(CN)4] confirmed here by a critical analysis of the published data. The mechanism of CO2 physical sorption in ionic liquids is discussed based on the results analyzed, supported by spectroscopic measurements and molecular simulations previously reported and further suggestions of possibilities for enhanced physical sorption based on fluorinated aromatic rings, other cyano based anions, mixtures with other ILs or solvents or the use of porous liquids are proposed.}

The Hodgkin-Huxley model established a framework in which to describe the structural and functional properties of ion channels, including the mechanisms of ion permeation, selectivity, and gating. At a cellular level, the model is used to understand the conditions that control both the rate and timing of action potentials, essential for neural encoding of information. Finally, the Hodgkin-Huxley formalism is central to computational neuroscience to understand both neuronal integration and circuit level information processing, and how these mechanisms might have evolved to minimize energy cost. \textcopyright{} 2012 the authors.}

Scalar activity was introduced by increasing the temperature of half of the particles (labeled `hot') while keeping the temperature of the other half constant at a lower value (labeled `cold'). The relative temperature difference between the two subsystems is considered as a measure of the activity. From our simulations we observe that the two species tend to phase separate at sufficiently high activity ratio. The extent of separation is quantified by the defined order parameter and the entropy production during this process is determined by employing the two-phase thermodynamic (2PT) model and the standard modified Benedict\textendash Webb\textendash Rubin (MBWR) equation of state for a LJ fluid. We observe that the extent of the phase separation and entropy production increases with the density of the system. From a cluster analysis, we obtain the mean number of clusters {$\langle$}               n               cl               {$\rangle$}, and the mean size of the largest cluster {$\langle$}               n               0               {$\rangle$} in the system, complementing each other. Bond orientation order parameters reveal that the so formed largest cluster also develops solid-like order consisting of both FCC and HCP packing. The presence of such crystalline order is also supported by a common neighbor analysis.},

SANS may provide multiple independent data sets by means of contrast variation experiments, that is, by measuring at different D2O concentrations and different perdeuteration conditions of the biomolecular complex. However, even the combined data from multiple SAXS/SANS sets is by far insufficient to define all degrees of freedom of a complex, leading to a significant risk of overfitting when refining biomolecular structures against SAXS/SANS data. Hence, to control against overfitting, the low-information SAXS/SANS data must be complemented by accurate physical models, and, if possible, refined models should be cross-validated against independent data not used during the refinement. We present a method for refining atomic biomolecular structures against multiple sets of SAXS and SANS data using all-atom molecular dynamics simulations. Using the protein citrate synthase and the protein/RNA complex Sxl-Unr-msl2 mRNA as test cases, we demonstrate how multiple SAXS and SANS sets may be used for refinement and cross-validation, thereby excluding overfitting during refinement. For the Sxl-Unr-msl2 complex, we find that perdeuteration of the Unr domain leads to a unique, slightly compacted conformation, whereas other perdeuteration conditions lead to similar solution conformations compared to the nondeuterated state. In line with our previous method for predicting SAXS curves, SANS curves were predicted with explicit-solvent calculations, taking atomic models for both the hydration layer and the excluded solvent into account, thereby avoiding the use of solvent-related fitting parameters and solvent-reduced neutron scattering lengths. We expect the method to be useful for deriving and validating solution structures of biomolecules and soft-matter complexes, and for critically assessing whether multiple SAXS and SANS sets are mutually compatible.}

In this work, we report the full ORR reaction mechanism for Pt(111) based on Quantum Mechanics (QM) based Reactive metadynamics (R{$\mu$}D) simulations including explicit water to obtain free energy reaction barriers at 298 K. The lowest energy pathway for 4 e- water formation is: first, *OOH formation; second, *OOH reduction to H2O and O*; third, O* hydrolysis using surface water to produce two *OH and finally *OH hydration to water. Water formation is the rate-determining step (RDS) for potentials above 0.87 Volt, the normal operating range. Considering the Eley\textendash Rideal (ER) mechanism involving protons from the solvent, we predict the free energy reaction barrier at 298 K for water formation to be 0.25 eV for an external potential below U = 0.87 V and 0.41 eV at U = 1.23 V, in good agreement with experimental values of 0.22 eV and 0.44 eV, respectively. With the mechanism now fully understood, we can use this now validated methodology to examine the changes upon alloying and surface modifications to increase the rate by reducing the barrier for water formation.},

  abstract = {Enterobacteriaceae produce antimicrobial peptides for survival under nutrient starvation. Microcin J25 (MccJ25) is an antimicrobial peptide with a unique lasso topology. It is secreted by the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) exporter McjD, which ensures self-immunity of the producing strain through efficient export of the toxic mature peptide from the cell. Here we have determined the crystal structure of McjD from Escherichia coli at 2.7-\AA{} resolution, which is to the authors' knowledge the first structure of an antibacterial peptide ABC transporter. Our functional and biochemical analyses demonstrate McjD-dependent immunity to MccJ25 through efflux of the peptide. McjD can directly bind MccJ25 and displays a basal ATPase activity that is stimulated by MccJ25 in both detergent solution and proteoliposomes. McjD adopts a new conformation, termed nucleotide-bound outward occluded. The new conformation defines a clear cavity; mutagenesis and ligand binding studies of the cavity have identified Phe86, Asn134, and Asn302 as important for recognition of MccJ25. Comparisons with the inward-open MsbA and outward-open Sav1866 structures show that McjD has structural similarities with both states without the intertwining of transmembrane (TM) helices. The occluded state is formed by rotation of TMs 1 and 2 toward the equivalent TMs of the opposite monomer, unlike Sav1866 where they intertwine with TMs 3-6 of the opposite monomer. Cysteine cross-linking studies on the McjD dimer in inside-out membrane vesicles of E. coli confirmed the presence of the occluded state. We therefore propose that the outward-occluded state represents a transition intermediate between the outward-open and inward-open conformation of ABC exporters.},

The first person to use the word "geography" was Eratosthenes (276-194 BC). Four historical traditions in geographical research are the spatial analysis of the natural and the human phenomena (geography as the study of distribution), the area studies (places and regions), the study of the man-land relationship, and the research in the earth sciences.[3] Nonetheless, the modern geography is an all-encompassing discipline that foremost seeks to understand the Earth and all of its human and natural complexities\textemdash not merely where objects are, but how they have changed and come to be. Geography has been called "the world discipline" and "the bridge between the human and the physical science". Geography is divided into two main branches: the human geography and the physical geography.[4][5][6]},

During this short interval a supernova can radiate as much energy as the Sun is expected to emit over its entire life span.[1] The explosion expels much or all of a star's material[2] at a velocity of up to 30,000 km/s (10\% of the speed of light), driving a shock wave[3] into the surrounding interstellar medium. This shock wave sweeps up an expanding shell of gas and dust called a supernova remnant.},

  abstract = {Soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptors (SNAREs) mediate membrane fusion reactions in eukaryotic cells by assembling into complexes that link vesicle-associated SNAREs with SNAREs on target membranes (t-SNAREs). Many SNARE complexes contain two t-SNAREs that form a heterodimer, a putative intermediate in SNARE assembly. Individual t-SNAREs (e.g., syntaxin 1A) also regulate synaptic calcium channels and cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), the epithelial chloride channel that is defective in cystic fibrosis. Whether the regulation of ion channels by individual t-SNAREs is related to SNARE complex assembly and membrane fusion is unknown. Here we show that CFTR channels are coordinately regulated by two cognate t-SNAREs, SNAP-23 (synaptosome-associated protein of 23 kDa) and syntaxin 1A. SNAP-23 physically associates with CFTR by binding to its amino-terminal tail, a region that modulates channel gating. CFTR-mediated chloride currents are inhibited by introducing excess SNAP-23 into HT29-Cl.19A epithelial cells. Conversely, CFTR activity is stimulated by a SNAP-23 antibody that blocks the binding of this t-SNARE to the CFTR amino-terminal tail. The physical and functional interactions between SNAP-23 and CFTR depend on syntaxin 1A, which binds to both proteins. We conclude that CFTR channels are regulated by a t-SNARE complex that may tune CFTR activity to rates of membrane traffic in epithelial cells.},

  abstract = {Soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptors (SNAREs) mediate membrane fusion reactions in eukaryotic cells by assembling into complexes that link vesicle-associated SNAREs with SNAREs on target membranes (t-SNAREs). Many SNARE complexes contain two t-SNAREs that form a heterodimer, a putative intermediate in SNARE assembly. Individual t-SNAREs (e.g., syntaxin 1A) also regulate synaptic calcium channels and cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), the epithelial chloride channel that is defective in cystic fibrosis. Whether the regulation of ion channels by individual t-SNAREs is related to SNARE complex assembly and membrane fusion is unknown. Here we show that CFTR channels are coordinately regulated by two cognate t-SNAREs, SNAP-23 (synaptosome-associated protein of 23 kDa) and syntaxin 1A. SNAP-23 physically associates with CFTR by binding to its amino-terminal tail, a region that modulates channel gating. CFTR-mediated chloride currents are inhibited by introducing excess SNAP-23 into HT29-Cl.19A epithelial cells. Conversely, CFTR activity is stimulated by a SNAP-23 antibody that blocks the binding of this t-SNARE to the CFTR amino-terminal tail. The physical and functional interactions between SNAP-23 and CFTR depend on syntaxin 1A, which binds to both proteins. We conclude that CFTR channels are regulated by a t-SNARE complex that may tune CFTR activity to rates of membrane traffic in epithelial cells.},

This effective two-body force field is the successor to the Weiner et al. force field and was developed with some of the same philosophies, such as the use of a simple diagonal potential function and electrostatic potential fit atom centered charges. The need for a 10-12 function for representing hydrogen bonds is no longer necessary due to the improved performance of the new charge model and new van der Waals parameters. These new charges are determined using a 6-31G* basis set and restrained electrostatic potential (RESP) fitting and have been shown to reproduce interaction energies, free energies of solvation, and conformational energies of simple small molecules to a good degree of accuracy. Furthermore, the new RESP charges exhibit less variability as a function of the molecular conformation used in the charge determination. The new van der Waals parameters have been derived from liquid simulations and include hydrogen parameters which take into account the effects of any geminal electronegative atoms. The bonded parameters developed by Weiner et al. were modified as necessary to reproduce experimental vibrational frequencies and structures. Most of the simple dihedral parameters have been retained from Weiner et al., but a complex set of and parameters which do a good job of reproducing the energies of the low-energy conformations of glycyl and alanyl dipeptides has been developed for the peptide backbone.},

EMBO J. 23: 282-293) identified two regions absent from structures of all other NBDs determined so far, a "regulatory insertion" (residues 404-435) and a "regulatory extension" (residues 639-670), both positioned to impede formation of the putative NBD1-NBD2 dimer anticipated to occur during channel gating; as both segments appeared highly mobile and both contained consensus PKA sites (serine 422, and serines 660 and 670, respectively), it was suggested that their phosphorylation-linked conformational changes might underlie CFTR channel regulation. To test that suggestion, we coexpressed in Xenopus oocytes CFTR residues 1-414 with residues 433-1480, or residues 1-633 with 668-1480, to yield split CFTR channels (called 414+433 and 633+668) that lack most of the insertion, or extension, respectively. In excised patches, regulation of the resulting CFTR channels by PKA and by ATP was largely normal. Both 414+433 channels and 633+668 channels, as well as 633(S422A)+668 channels (lacking both the extension and the sole PKA consensus site in the insertion), were all shut during exposure to MgATP before addition of PKA, but activated like wild type (WT) upon phosphorylation; this indicates that inhibitory regulation of nonphosphorylated WT channels depends upon neither segment. Detailed kinetic analysis of 414+433 channels revealed intact ATP dependence of single-channel gating kinetics, but slightly shortened open bursts and faster closing from the locked-open state (elicited by ATP plus pyrophosphate or ATP plus AMPPNP). In contrast, 633+668 channel function was indistinguishable from WT at both macroscopic and microscopic levels. We conclude that neither nonconserved segment is an essential element of PKA- or nucleotide-dependent regulation.},

Detailed kinetic analysis of 414+433 channels revealed intact ATP dependence of single-channel gating kinetics, but slightly shortened open bursts and faster closing from the locked-open state (elicited by ATP plus pyrophosphate or ATP plus AMPPNP). In contrast, 633+668 channel function was indistinguishable from WT at both macroscopic and microscopic levels. We conclude that neither nonconserved segment is an essential element of PKA- or nucleotide-dependent regulation.},

  abstract = {The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) belongs to the ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporter superfamily but functions as an anion channel crucial for salt and water transport across epithelial cells. CFTR dysfunction, because of mutations, causes cystic fibrosis (CF). The anionselective pore of the CFTR protein is formed by its two transmembrane domains (TMDs) and regulated by its cytosolic domains: two nucleotide binding domains (NBDs) and a regulatory (R) domain. Channel activation requires phosphorylation of the R domain by cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA), and pore opening and closing (gating) of phosphorylated channels is driven by ATP binding and hydrolysis at the NBDs. This review summarizes available information on structure and mechanism of the CFTR protein, with a particular focus on atomic-level insight gained from recent cryo-electron microscopic structures and on the molecular mechanisms of channel gating and its regulation. The pharmacological mechanisms of small molecules targeting CFTR's ion channel function, aimed at treating patients suffering from CF and other diseases, are briefly discussed.}

  abstract = {Arginine 352 (R352) in the sixth transmembrane domain of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) previously was reported to form an anion/cation selectivity filter and to provide positive charge in the intracellular vestibule. However, mutations at this site have nonspecific effects, such as inducing susceptibility of endogenous cysteines to chemical modification. We hypothesized that R352 stabilizes channel structure and that charge-destroying mutations at this site disrupt pore architecture, with multiple consequences. We tested the effects of mutations at R352 on conductance, anion selectivity and block by the sulfonylurea drug glipizide, using recordings of wild-type and mutant channels. Charge-altering mutations at R352 destabilized the open state and altered both selectivity and block. In contrast, R352K-CFTR was similar to wild-type. Full conductance state amplitude was similar to that of wild-type CFTR in all mutants except R352E, suggesting that R352 does not itself form an anion coordination site. In an attempt to identify an acidic residue that may interact with R352, we found that permeation properties were similarly affected by charge-reversing mutations at D993. Wild-type-like properties were rescued in R352E/D993R-CFTR, suggesting that R352 and D993 in the wild-type channel may interact to stabilize pore architecture. Finally, R352A-CFTR was sensitive to modification by externally applied MTSEA+, while wild-type and R352E/D993R-CFTR were not. These data suggest that R352 plays an important structural role in CFTR, perhaps reflecting its involvement in forming a salt bridge with residue D993. \textcopyright{} 2008 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

  abstract = {Store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE) is a critical Ca2+ signaling pathway in many cell types. After sensing Ca2+ store depletion in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) lumen, STIM1 (STromal Interaction Molecule 1) oligomerizes and then interacts with and activates the Orai1 calcium channel. Our previous research has demonstrated that the inhibitory helix (IH) adjacent to the first coiled-coil region (CC1) of STIM1 may keep the whole C-terminus of STIM1 in an inactive state. However, the specific conformational change of CC1-IH that drives the transition of STIM1 from the resting state to the active state remains elusive. Herein, we report the structural analysis of CC1-IH, which revealed that the entire CC1-IH molecule forms a very long helix. Structural and biochemical analyses indicated that IH, and not the CC1 region, contributes to the oligomerization of STIM1. Small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) analysis suggested that the C-terminus of STIM1 including the IH region displays a collapsed conformation, whereas the construct without the IH region has an extended conformation. These two conformations may correspond to the conformational states of the C-terminus of STIM1 before and after activation. Taken together, our results provide direct biochemical evidence that the IH region controls the conformational switching of the C-terminus of STIM1. \textcopyright{} 2013 Cui et al.}

In the present study, we determined how the two salt bridges cooperate to maintain the open pore architecture of CFTR. Our data suggest that Arg347 not only interacts with Asp924 but also interacts with Asp993. The tripartite interaction Arg347-Asp924-Asp993 mainly contributes to maintaining a stable s2 open subconductance state. The Arg352-Asp993 salt bridge, in contrast, is involved in stabilizing both the s2 and full (f) open conductance states, with the main contribution being to the f state. The s1 subconductance state does not require either salt bridge. In confirmation of the role of Arg352 and Asp993, channels bearing cysteines at these sites could be latched into a full open state using the bifunctional cross-linker 1,2-ethanediyl bismethanethiosulfonate, but only when applied in the open state. Channels remained latched open even after washout of ATP. The results suggest that these interacting residues contribute differently to stabilizing the open pore in different phases of the gating cycle. \textcopyright{} 2013 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.},

Mutation R117H has been reported to reduce current amplitude, whereas D110H, E116K, and R117C/L/P may impair channel stability. We hypothesized that these amino acids might not be directly involved in ion conduction and permeation but may contribute to stabilizing the outer vestibule architecture in CFTR. We used cRNA injected oocytes combined with electrophysiological techniques to test this hypothesis. Mutants bearing cysteine at these sites were not functionally modified by extracellular MTS reagents and were blocked by GlyH-101 similarly to WT-CFTR. These results suggest that these three residues do not contribute directly to permeation in CFTR. In contrast, mutants D110R-, E116R-, and R117A-CFTR exhibited instability of the open state and significantly shortened burst duration compared with WT-CFTR and failed to be locked into the open state by AMP-PNP (adenosine 5'-(\ss,{$\gamma$}-imido) triphosphate); charge-retaining mutants showed mainly the full open state with comparably longer open burst duration. These interactions suggest that these ECL1 residues might be involved in maintaining the outer pore architecture of CFTR. A CFTR homology model suggested that E116 interacts with R104 in both the closed and open states, D110 interacts with K892 in the fully closed state, and R117 interacts with E1126 in the open state. These interactions were confirmed experimentally. The results suggest that D110, E116, and R117 may contribute to stabilizing the architecture of the outer pore of CFTR by interactions with other charged residues. \textcopyright{} 2014 Cui et al.}

Potentiation of some other mutants, including G551D-CFTR, was less dependent upon the level of phosphorylation, likely related to the severe gating defects in these mutants exhibited in part by a shift in PKA sensitivity to activation, possibly due to an electrostatic interaction of D551 with K1250. Phosphorylation-dependent potentiation of wildtype CFTR and other variants also was observed in epithelial cells. Hence, the efficacy of potentiators may be obscured by a ceiling effect when drug screening is performed under strongly phosphorylating conditions.

Disruption of CFTR function is associated with cystic fibrosis making it an attractive therapeutic target. In addition, CFTR blockers are being developed as potential antidiarrheals. CFTR drug discovery is hampered by the lack of high resolution structural data, and considerable efforts have been invested in modeling the channel structure. Although previously published CFTR models that have been made publicly available mostly agree with experimental data relating to the overall structure, they present the channel in an outward-facing conformation that does not agree with expected properties of a "channel-like" structure. Here, we make available a model of CFTR in such a "channel-like" conformation, derived by a unique modeling approach combining restrained homology modeling and ROSETTA refinement. In contrast to others, the present model is in agreement with expected channel properties such as pore shape, dimensions, solvent accessibility, and experimentally derived distances. We have used the model to explore the interaction of open channel blockers within the pore, revealing a common binding mode and ionic interaction with K95, in agreement with experimental data. The binding-site was further validated using a virtual screening enrichment experiment, suggesting the model might be suitable for drug discovery. In addition, we subjected the model to a molecular dynamics simulation, revealing previously unaddressed salt-bridge interactions that may be important for structure stability and pore-lining residues that may take part in Cl - conductance. \textcopyright{} 2012 American Chemical Society.}

Because cooperative H-bond fluctuations and ion migration complicate the straightforward interpretation of measured DR timescales in terms of molecular dipolar rotations for these conducting media which support extensive intra- and inter-species H-bonding, one needs to separate out the individual components from the overall relaxation for examining the microscopic origin of various timescales. The present study does so and finds that reorientation of ion-complexed acetamide molecules generates relaxation timescales that are in sub-nanosecond to nanosecond range. This explains in molecular terms the nanosecond timescales reported by recent giga-Hertz DR measurements. Interestingly, the simulated survival timescale for the acetamide-Li+ complex has been found to be a few tens of nanosecond, suggesting such a cation-complexed species may be responsible for a similar timescale reported by mega-Hertz DR measurements of acetamide/potassium thiocyanate deep eutectics near room temperature. The issue of collective versus single particle relaxation is discussed, and jump waiting time distributions are determined. Dependence on anion-identity in each of the cases has been examined. In short, the present study demonstrates that assumption of nano-sized domain formation is not required for explaining the DR detected nanosecond and longer timescales in these media.}

Development of pharmaceutical strategies to treat CF requires understanding of the mechanisms underlying channel function. However, incomplete 3D structural information on the unique ABC ion channel, CFTR, hinders elucidation of its functional mechanism and correction of cystic fibrosis causing mutants. Several CFTR homology models have been developed using bacterial ABC transporters as templates but these have low sequence similarity to CFTR and are not ion channels. Here, we refine an earlier model in an outward (OWF) and develop an inward (IWF) facing model employing an integrated experimental-molecular dynamics simulation (200 ns) approach. Our IWF structure agrees well with a recently solved cryo-EM structure of a CFTR IWF state. We utilize cysteine cross-linking to verify positions and orientations of residues within trans-membrane helices (TMHs) of the OWF conformation and to reconstruct a physiologically relevant pore structure. Comparison of pore profiles of the two conformations reveal a radius sufficient to permit passage of hydrated Cl-ions in the OWF but not the IWF model. To identify structural determinants that distinguish the two conformations and possible rearrangements of TMHs within them responsible for channel gating, we perform cross-linking by bifunctional reagents of multiple predicted pairs of cysteines in TMH 6 and 12 and 6 and 9. To determine whether the effects of cross-linking on gating observed are the result of switching of the channel from open to close state, we also treat the same residue pairs with monofunctional reagents in separate experiments. Both types of reagents prevent ion currents indicating that pore blockage is primarily responsible.}

In short, the present study demonstrates that assumption of nano-sized domain formation is not required for explaining the DR detected nanosecond and longer timescales in these media.}

  abstract = {Background: Investigation of novel cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) potentiators, such as GLPG1837, for CF patients with gating mutations is challenging as trials require patients to withhold ivacaftor, the current standard of care. This study explored the feasibility of such a study and the impact of one-week ivacaftor withdrawal. Methods: This open-label, single-arm study aimed to enrol 32 adults {$\geq$}18 years of age with CF and at least one p.Gly551Asp (G551D) mutation. Patients received three increasing GLPG1837 dosages twice-daily for two 7-day and one 14-day period following a one-week ivacaftor washout. The primary outcome was safety; secondary outcomes were changes in sweat chloride concentration, spirometry outcomes, and pharmacokinetics. Results: Twenty-six patients enrolled; 24 completed the study. Adverse events were reported by 53.8\textendash 76.9\% of patients (dosage-dependent), with respiratory adverse events most common. Mean sweat chloride concentrations decreased from 97.7 mmol/L (baseline) to 68.7 mmol/L (end of GLPG1837 treatment). In ivacaftor-pre-treated patients, mean sweat chloride concentrations rose from 42.5 mmol/L at screening to 98.5 mmol/L after ivacaftor washout. Levels were decreased following GLPG1837 treatment (to 68.8 mmol/L at treatment end). Percent predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 s declined from 73.3\% at screening to 68.5\% after ivacaftor washout but returned to screening level at treatment end (73.1\%). Conclusions: Patient willingness to participate in the study suggests that the need for a short period of ivacaftor withdrawal may not be a barrier to development of novel potentiators, such as GLPG1837. A one-week ivacaftor washout was generally well tolerated, but resulted in a decline in lung function, which was reversed with GLPG1837 treatment to pre-washout levels. Combined with the concentration-dependent decrease in sweat chloride concentration, results show that GLPG1837 increases CFTR activity in G551D-CF patients.

We show that the induced affine extensions of the non-crystallographic groups H\_4, H\_3 and H\_2 correspond to a distinguished subset of the Kac-Moody-type extensions considered in Dechant et al. This class of extensions was motivated by physical applications in icosahedral systems in biology (viruses), physics (quasicrystals) and chemistry (fullerenes). By connecting these here to extensions of E\_8, D\_6 and A\_4, we place them into the broader context of crystallographic lattices such as E\_8, suggesting their potential for applications in high energy physics, integrable systems and modular form theory. By inverting the projection, we make the case for admitting different number fields in the Cartan matrix, which could open up enticing possibilities in hyperbolic geometry and rational conformal field theory.},

  abstract = {In this paper we discuss reflection groups and root systems, in particular non-crystallographic ones, and a Clifford algebra framework for both these concepts. A review of historical as well as more recent work on viral capsid symmetries motivates the focus on the icosahedral root system H3. We discuss a notion of affine extension for noncrystallographic groups with applications to fullerenes and viruses. The icosahedrally ordered component of the nucleic acid within the virus capsid and the interaction between the two have shed light on the viral assembly process with interesting applications to antiviral therapies, drug delivery and nanotechnology. The Clifford algebra framework is very natural, as it uses precisely the structure that is already implicit in this root system and reflection group context, i.e. a vector space with an inner product. In addition, it affords a uniquely simple reflection formula, a double cover of group transformations, and more insight into the geometry, e.g. the geometry of the Coxeter plane. This approach made possible a range of root system induction proofs, such as the constructions of E8 from H3 and the exceptional 4D root systems from 3D root systems. This makes explicit various connections between what Arnold called Trinities (sets of three exceptional cases). In fact this generalises further since the induction construction contains additional cases, namely two infinite families of cases. It therefore actually yields ADE correspondences between three sets of different mathematical concepts that are usually thought of separately as polytopes, subgroups of SU (2) and ADE Lie algebras. Here we connect them explicitly and in a unified way by thinking of them as three different sets of root systems.

In this paper, we report on the use of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and machine learning to study the binding mechanism of a transition state analogue (DADMe-immucillin-H) to the purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP) enzyme. Microsecond-long MD simulations allow us to observe several binding events, following different dynamical routes and reaching diverse binding configurations. These simulations are used to estimate kinetic and thermodynamic quantities, such as k on and binding free energy, obtaining a good agreement with available experimental data. In addition, we advance a hypothesis for the slow-onset inhibition mechanism of DADMe-immucillin-H against PNP. Combining extensive MD simulations with machine learning algorithms could therefore be a fruitful approach for capturing key aspects of drug-target recognition and binding.},

Forskolin induces rapid swelling of organoids derived from healthy controls or wild-type mice, but this effect is strongly reduced in organoids of subjects with cystic fibrosis or in mice carrying the Cftr F508del mutation and is absent in Cftr-deficient organoids. This pattern is phenocopied by CFTR-specific inhibitors. Forskolin-induced swelling of in vitro-expanded human control and cystic fibrosis organoids corresponds quantitatively with forskolin-induced anion currents in freshly excised ex vivo rectal biopsies. Function of the CFTR F508del mutant protein is restored by incubation at low temperature, as well as by CFTR-restoring compounds.

Additionally, heterogeneity in in vivo modulator response has been reported among individuals carrying homozygous F508del-CFTR, adding to the desire for an optimal prediction of response-to-therapy on an individual level. In the last decade, a lot of progress has been made in the development of primary cell cultures into 3D patient-derived disease models. The advantage of these models is that the endogenous CFTR function is affected by the patient's mutation as well as other genetic or environmental factors. In this review we focus on intestinal organoids as in vitro model for CF, enabling for CF disease classification, drug development and treatment optimization in a personalized manner, taking into account rare CFTR mutations and clinical heterogeneity among individuals with CF.},

  abstract = {The Josephin Domain (JD), i.e. the N-terminal domain of Ataxin 3 (At3) protein, is an interesting example of competition between physiological function and aggregation risk. In fact, the fibrillogenesis of Ataxin 3, responsible for the spinocerebbellar ataxia 3, is strictly related to the JD thermodynamic stability. Whereas recent NMR studies have demonstrated that different JD conformations exist, the likelihood of JD achievable conformational states in solution is still an open issue. Marked differences in the available NMR models are located in the hairpin region, supporting the idea that JD has a flexible hairpin in dynamic equilibrium between open and closed states. In this work we have carried out an investigation on the JD conformational arrangement by means of both classical molecular dynamics (MD) and Metadynamics employing essential coordinates as collective variables. We provide a representation of the free energy landscape characterizing the transition pathway from a JD open-like structure to a closed-like conformation. Findings of our in silico study strongly point to the closed-like conformation as the most likely for a Josephin Domain in water.},

The goals of the present study are to quantitatively assess the gating defects associated with the N1303K mutation and its pharmacological response to CFTR modulators including potentiators VX-770 and GLPG1837 and correctors VX-809, and VX-661. Methods: Gating behavior and pharmacological responses to CFTR potentiators were assessed using patch-clamp technique in the excised, inside-out mode. We also examined the effects of GLPG1837, VX-770, VX-809 and VX-661 on N1303K-CFTR surface expression using Western blot analysis. Results: Like wild-type (WT) CFTR, N1303K-CFTR channels were activated by protein kinase A-dependent phosphorylation, but the open probability (Po) of phosphorylated N1303K-CFTR was extremely low ({$\sim$}0.03 vs {$\sim$}0.45 in WT channels). N1303K mutants showed abnormal responses to ATP analogs or mutations that disrupt ATP hydrolysis and/or dimerization of CFTR's two nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs). However, the Po of N1303K-CFTR was dramatically increased by GLPG1837 ({$\sim$}17-fold) and VX-770 ({$\sim$}8-fold). VX-809 or VX-661 enhanced N1303K-CFTR maturation by 2\textendash 3 fold, and co-treatment with GLPG1837 or VX-770 did not show any negative drug-drug interaction. Conclusion: N1303K has a severe gating defect, reduced ATP-dependence and aberrant response to ATP analogs. These results suggest a defective function of the NBDs in N1303K-CFTR.

HADDOC K is a popular docking program that takes a datadriven approach to docking, with support for a wide range of experimental data. Here we present the HADDOC K web server protocol, facilitating the modeling of biomolecular complexes for a wide community. The main web interface is user-friendly, requiring only the structures of the individual components and a list of interacting residues as input. Additional web interfaces allow the more advanced user to exploit the full range of experimental data supported by HADDOC K and to customize the docking process. The HADDOC K server has access to the resources of a dedicated cluster and of the e-NMR GRID infrastructure. Therefore, a typical docking run takes only a few minutes to prepare and a few hours to complete. \textcopyright{} 2010 Nature Publishing Group.},

By combining high-throughput MD with Markov state models (MSMs), it is now possible to obtain long time-scale behavior of small to intermediate biomolecules and complexes. To model the interactions of many molecules at large length scales, particle-based reaction-diffusion (RD) simulations are more suit{$\rightleftharpoons$}able but lack molecular detail. Thus, coupling MSMs and RD simulations (MSM/RD) would be highly desirable, as they could efficiently produce simulations at large time and length scales, while still conserving the characteristic features of the interactions observed at atomic detail. While such a coupling seems straightforward, fundamental questions are still open: Which definition of MSM states is suitable? Which protocol to merge and split RD particles in an association/dissociation reaction will conserve the correct bimolecular kinetics and thermodynamics? In this paper, we make the first step toward MSM/RD by laying out a general theory of coupling and proposing a first implementation for association/dissociation of a protein with a small ligand (A + B {$\rightleftharpoons$} C). Applications on a toy model and CO diffusion into the heme cavity of myoglobin are reported.},

To model the interactions of many molecules at large length scales, particle-based reaction-diffusion (RD) simulations are more suit{$\rightleftharpoons$}able but lack molecular detail. Thus, coupling MSMs and RD simulations (MSM/RD) would be highly desirable, as they could efficiently produce simulations at large time and length scales, while still conserving the characteristic features of the interactions observed at atomic detail. While such a coupling seems straightforward, fundamental questions are still open: Which definition of MSM states is suitable? Which protocol to merge and split RD particles in an association/dissociation reaction will conserve the correct bimolecular kinetics and thermodynamics? In this paper, we make the first step toward MSM/RD by laying out a general theory of coupling and proposing a first implementation for association/dissociation of a protein with a small ligand (A + B {$\rightleftharpoons$} C). Applications on a toy model and CO diffusion into the heme cavity of myoglobin are reported.}

The underlying mechanisms are complex and not yet fully understood. Lymphopenia, atrophy of the thymus gland, toxic serum factors, induction of enhancing mechanisms by certain serum fractions and metabolic defects of lymphocytes--all were shown to be involved or at least considered to be.

  abstract = {Potential of mean force (PMF) calculations are used to characterize the free energy landscape of protein\textendash lipid and protein\textendash protein association within membranes. Coarse-grained simulations allow binding free energies to be determined with reasonable statistical error. This accuracy relies on defining a good collective variable to describe the binding and unbinding transitions, and upon criteria for assessing the convergence of the simulation toward representative equilibrium sampling. As examples, we calculate protein\textendash lipid binding PMFs for ANT/cardiolipin and Kir2.2/PIP2, using umbrella sampling on a distance coordinate. These highlight the importance of replica exchange between windows for convergence. The use of two independent sets of simulations, initiated from bound and unbound states, provide strong evidence for simulation convergence. For a model protein\textendash protein interaction within a membrane, center-of-mass distance is shown to be a poor collective variable for describing transmembrane helix\textendash helix dimerization. Instead, we employ an alternative intermolecular distance matrix RMS (DRMS) coordinate to obtain converged PMFs for the association of the glycophorin transmembrane domain. While the coarse-grained force field gives a reasonable Kd for dimerization, the majority of the bound population is revealed to be in a near-native conformation. Thus, the combination of a refined reaction coordinate with improved sampling reveals previously unnoticed complexities of the dimerization free energy landscape. We propose the use of replica-exchange umbrella sampling starting from different initial conditions as a robust approach for calculation of the binding energies in membrane simulations.},

We analyzed and compared the simulation results obtained by these two methods based on several aspects, such as root mean square deviation (RMSD), native contacts, cluster analysis, folding snapshots, free energy landscape, and the evolution of the radius of gyration, which showed that these eight proteins were successfully and consistently folded into the corresponding native structures by AMD simulations carried out at room temperature. In addition, the folding occurred in the range of 40{$\sim$}180 ns after starting from the linear structures of the eight proteins at 300 K. By contrast, these stable folding structures were not found when the traditional molecular dynamics (MD) simulation was used. At the same time, the influence of high temperatures (350, 400, and 450 K) is also further investigated. Study found that the simulation efficiency of AMD is higher than that of MD simulations, regardless of the temperature. Of these temperatures, 300 K is the most suitable temperature for protein folding for all systems. To further investigate the efficiency of AMD, another trajectory was simulated for eight proteins with the same linear structure but different random seeds at 300 K. Both AMD trajectories reached the correct folded structures. Our result clearly shows that AMD simulation are a highly efficient and reliable method for the study of protein folding.},

  abstract = {Potassium (K+) channels are specialized membrane proteins that are able to facilitate and regulate the conduction of K+ through cell membranes. Comprising five specific cation binding sites (S0-S4) formed by the backbone carbonyl groups of conserved residues common to all K+ channels, the narrow selectivity filter allows fast conduction of K+ while being highly selective for K+ over Na+. To extend our knowledge of the microscopic mechanism underlying selectivity in K+ channels, we characterize the free energy landscapes governing the entry and translocation of a Na+ or a K+ from the extracellular side into the selectivity filter of KcsA. The entry process of an extracellular ion is examined in the presence of two additional K+ in the pore, and the three-ion potential of mean force is computed using extensive all-atom umbrella sampling molecular dynamics simulations. A comparison of the potentials of mean force yields a number of important results. First, the free energy minima corresponding to configurations with extracellular K+ or Na+ in binding site S0 or S1 are similar in depth, suggesting that the thermodynamic selectivity governed by the free energy minima for those two binding sites is insignificant. Second, the free energy barriers between stable multi-ion configurations are generally higher for Na+ than for K+, implying that the kinetics of ion conduction is slower when a Na+ enters the pore. Third, the region corresponding to binding site S2 near the center of the narrow pore emerges as the most selective for K+ over Na+. In particular, while there is a stable minimum for K+ in site S2, Na+ faces a steep free energy increase with no local free energy well in this region. Lastly, analysis shows that selectivity is not correlated with the overall coordination number of the ion entering the pore, but is predominantly affected by changes in the type of coordinating ligands (carbonyls versus water molecules). These results further highlight the importance of the central region near binding site S2 in the selectivity filter of K+ channels. \textcopyright{} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

Since then more than thirty therapeutic antibodies have been marketed, mostly as oncology, autoimmune and inflammatory therapeutics. While antibodies are very efficient, their cost-effectiveness has always been discussed owing to their high costs, accumulating to more than one billion dollars from preclinical development through to market approval. Because of this, therapeutic antibodies are inaccessible to some patients in both developed and developing countries. The growing interest in biosimilar antibodies as affordable versions of therapeutic antibodies may provide alternative treatment options as well potentially decreasing costs. As certain markets begin to capitalize on this opportunity, regulatory authorities continue to refine the requirements for demonstrating quality, efficacy and safety of biosimilar compared to originator products. In addition to biosimilars, innovations in antibody engineering are providing the opportunity to design biobetter antibodies with improved properties to maximize efficacy. Enhancing effector function, antibody drug conjugates (ADC) or targeting multiple disease pathways via multi-specific antibodies are being explored. The manufacturing process of antibodies is also moving forward with advancements relating to host cell production and purification processes. Studies into the physical and chemical degradation pathways of antibodies are contributing to the design of more stable proteins guided by computational tools. Moreover, the delivery and pharmacokinetics of antibody-based therapeutics are improving as optimized formulations are pursued through the implementation of recent innovations in the field.},

Regulation of CFTR channel activity is stringently controlled by phosphorylation and nucleotide binding. Structural changes that underlie transitions between active and inactive functional states are not yet fully understood. Indeed the first 3D structures of dephosphorylated, ATP-free, and phosphorylated ATP-bound states were only recently reported. Here we have determined the structure of inactive and active states of a thermally stabilized CFTR, the latter with a very high channel open probability, confirmed after reconstitution into proteoliposomes. These structures, obtained at nominal resolution of 4.3 and 6.6 \AA, reveal a unique repositioning of the transmembrane helices and regulatory domain density that provide insights into the structural transition between active and inactive functional states of CFTR. Moreover, we observe an extracellular vestibule that may provide anion access to the pore due to the conformation of transmembrane helices 7 and 8 that differs from the previous orthologue CFTR structures. In conclusion, our work contributes detailed structural information on an active, open state of the CFTR anion channel.},

  abstract = {A systematic analysis is performed on the effectiveness of removing degrees of freedom from hydrogen atoms and/or increasing hydrogen masses to increase the efficiency of molecular dynamics simulations of hydrogen-rich systems such as proteins in water. In proteins, high-frequency bond-angle vibrations involving hydrogen atoms limit the time step to 3 fs, which is already a factor of 1.5 beyond the commonly used time step of 2 fs. Removing these degrees of freedom from the system by constructing hydrogen atoms as dummy atoms, allows the time step to be increased to 7 fs, a factor of 3.5 compared with 2 fs. Additionally, a gain in simulation stability can be achieved by increasing the masses of hydrogen atoms with remaining degrees of freedom from 1 to 4 u. Increasing hydrogen mass without removing the high-frequency degrees of freedom allows the time step to be increased only to 4 fs, a factor of two, compared with 2 fs. The net gain in efficiency of sampling configurational space may be up to 15\% lower than expected from the increase in time step due to the increase in viscosity and decrease in diffusion constant. In principle, introducing dummy atoms and increasing hydrogen mass do not influence thermodynamical properties of the system and dynamical properties are shown to be influenced only to a moderate degree. Comparing the maximum time step attainable with these methods (7 fs) to the time step of 2 fs that is routinely used in simulation, and taking into account the increase in viscosity and decrease in diffusion constant, we can say that a net gain in simulation efficiency of a factor of 3 to 3.5 can be achieved. \textcopyright{} 1999 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.},

The most successful examples are the CFTR correctors, which transformed cystic fibrosis therapy. These molecules revert folding defects of the {$\Delta$}F508 mutant and are widely used to treat patients. However, their mechanism of action is unknown. Here we present cryo-electron microscopy structures of CFTR in complex with two FDA-approved correctors: lumacaftor and tezacaftor. Both drugs insert into a hydrophobic pocket in the first transmembrane domain (TMD1), linking together four helices that are thermodynamically unstable. Mutating residues at the binding site rendered {$\Delta$}F508-CFTR insensitive to lumacaftor and tezacaftor, underscoring the functional significance of the structural discovery. These results support a mechanism in which the correctors stabilize TMD1 at an early stage of biogenesis, prevent its pre-mature degradation, and thereby allosterically rescue a large number of disease-causing mutations.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.}

  abstract = {Small molecule chaperones have been exploited as therapeutics for the hundreds of diseases caused by protein misfolding. The most successful examples are the CFTR correctors, which transformed cystic fibrosis therapy. These molecules revert folding defects of the DF508 mutant and are widely used to treat patients. To investigate the molecular mechanism of their action, we determined cryo-electron microscopy structures of CFTR in complex with the FDA-approved correctors lumacaftor or tezacaftor. Both drugs insert into a hydrophobic pocket in the first transmembrane domain (TMD1), linking together four helices that are thermodynamically unstable. Mutating residues at the binding site rendered DF508-CFTR insensitive to lumacaftor and tezacaftor, underscoring the functional significance of the structural discovery. These results support a mechanism in which the correctors stabilize TMD1 at an early stage of biogenesis, prevent its premature degradation, and thereby allosterically rescuing many disease-causing mutations.},

The dependence of the period on the maximum angular swing is found to be more pronounced than in the pendulum case and tunable with a suitable choice of masses and moments of inertia. Computer acquisition of the force exerted on the horizontal plane allows comparison of the dynamical behavior of the system with computational predictions. The system deserves consideration for theoretical and experimental investigations in undergraduate physics courses for the nontrivial effects arising from the displacement of the center of mass from the geometrical cylinder axis and the anharmonic character of the oscillations.},

Enhanced sampling approaches can ensure convergence on minimum free energy pathways for activation, as illustrated here for pentameric ligand-gated ion channels that are principal to nervous system function and the actions of general anesthetics. We also examine recent studies of local anesthetic and antiepileptic drug binding to a sodium channel, revealing sites and pathways that may offer new targets for drug development. Modern simulations thus offer a range of molecular-level insights into ion channel function and modulation as a learning platform for mechanistic discovery and drug development.},

The unexpected temperature dependence in the ion distribution is explained on the basis of the cancellation of association entropy for ion-side chain pairs of opposite-charge and like-charge characters, which have positive and negative contributions, respectively. The C-terminal helix is observed to partially melt whereas a short {$\beta$} strand forms at the higher temperature with little salt dependence.

A monomer is built up of 18 anti-parallel beta-strands surrounding a hydrophilic pore, with a topology closely similar to that of maltoporin. Two non-overlapping sucrose-binding sites were identified in difference Fourier maps. The higher permeability for sucrose of ScrY as compared to maltoporin is mainly accounted for by differences in their pore-lining residues.},

Results from X-ray crystallography and isothermal titration calorimetry show that most anions associate with the binding pocket of HCAII by forming inner-sphere ion pairs with the Zn2+ cofactor. In these ion pairs, the free energy of anion-Zn2+ association is inversely proportional to the free energetic cost of anion dehydration; this relationship is consistent with the mechanism of ion pair formation suggested by the "law of matching water affinities". Iodide and bromide anions also associate with a hydrophobic declivity in the wall of the binding pocket. Molecular dynamics simulations suggest that anions, upon associating with Zn2+, trigger rearrangements of water that extend up to 8 \AA{} away from their surfaces. These findings expand the range of interactions previously thought to occur between ions and proteins by suggesting that (i) weakly hydrated anions can bind complementarily shaped hydrophobic declivities, and that (ii) ion-induced rearrangements of water within protein concavities can (in contrast with similar rearrangements in bulk water) extend well beyond the first hydration shells of the ions that trigger them. This study paints a picture of Hofmeister anions as a set of structurally varied ligands that differ in size, shape, and affinity for water and, thus, in their ability to bind to - and to alter the charge and hydration structure of - polar, nonpolar, and topographically complex concavities on the surfaces of proteins.}

  abstract = {A new generation of designer solvents emerged in the last decade as promising green media for multiple applications, including separation processes: the low-transition-temperature mixtures (LTTMs). They can be prepared by mixing natural high-melting-point starting materials, which form a liquid by hydrogen-bond interactions. Among them, deep-eutectic solvents (DESs) were presented as promising alternatives to conventional ionic liquids (ILs). Some limitations of ILs are overcome by LTTMs, which are cheap and easy to prepare from natural and readily available starting materials, biodegradable, and renewable. \textcopyright{} 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH \& Co.

The new liquid solvent is prepared by mixing two natural and readily available solid starting materials showing strong hydrogen bond interactions. The physical and phase behaviour of these mixtures can be tailored as a function of the nature and ratio of the constituents, temperature and water content. A complete characterization of physical properties (density, viscosity, surface tension, glass transition temperature) is carried out. The phase behaviour and Henry's constant for the pseudo-binary system composed of LTTM (lactic acid:choline chloride=2:1) and CO2 are also studied. This work opens room for further optimization of a possible CO2 capturing process using LTTMs. \textcopyright{} 2012 Elsevier B.V..},

None of the type IIIc, AX or ACCR(B) strains of rabbits gave either restricted responses when immunized with the pneumococcal vaccines. Three of the ACEP strain rabbits and two of the type III strain produced large quantities of highly restricted antibodies and were used to initiate structural studies on the antigen-combining site of antibody molecules. The rabbit antibodies were purified initially by affinity chromatography. The anti-SVIII antibodies were all eluted in a single fraction from an SVIII immunoadsorbent. The anti-SIII antibodies were all eluted in two fractions (one in various aqueous buffers and the other in guanidine-HCl) from an SIII immunoadsorbent. The specificially purified antibodies were examined analytically by isoelectric focusing in polyacrylamide gels and then were further fractionated by preparative liquid isoelectric focusing. Each purified antibody preparation from a restricted responder yielded 2-4 major electrofocused antibody fractions. The isoelectric point difference between the first and last eluted focused antibody fractions varied between 0{$\cdot$}2-0{$\cdot$}8 pH unit. The affinity chromatography and the isoelectric focusing procedures provide a successful means of preparatively obtaining different antibody fractions even from a single highly restricted antiserum. \textcopyright{} 1975.},

  abstract = {An ad-hoc, yet widely adopted approach to investigate complex molecular objects in motion using importance-sampling schemes involves two steps, namely (i) mapping the multidimensional free-energy landscape that characterizes the movements in the molecular object at hand and (ii) finding the most probable transition path connecting basins of the free-energy hyperplane. To achieve this goal, we turn to an importance-sampling algorithm, coined well-tempered metadynamics-extended adaptive biasing force (WTM-eABF), aimed at mapping rugged free-energy landscapes, combined with a path-searching algorithm, which we call multidimensional lowest energy (MULE), to identify the underlying minimum free-energy pathway in the collective-variable space of interest. First, the well-tempered feature of the importance-sampling scheme confers to the latter an asymptotic convergence, while the overall algorithm inherits the advantage of high sampling efficiency of its predecessor, meta-eABF, making its performance less sensitive to user-defined parameters. Second, the Dijkstra algorithm implemented in MULE is able to identify with utmost efficiency a pathway that satisfies minimum free energy of activation among all the possible routes in the multidimensional free-energy landscape. Numerical simulations of three molecular assemblies indicate that association of WTM-eABF and MULE constitutes a reliable, efficient and robust approach for exploring coupled movements in complex molecular objects. On account of its ease of use and intrinsic performance, we expect WTM-eABF and MULE to become a tool of choice for both experts and nonexperts interested in the thermodynamics and the kinetics of processes relevant to chemistry and biology.},

However, no peptide toxins have been identified that interact with known anion-selective channels such as the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). CFTR channels are expressed in epithelial cells and are associated with several genetic disorders, including cystic fibrosis and polycystic kidney disease. Several organic inhibitors have been used to investigate the structure of the Cl- permeation pathway in CFTR. However, investigations of the wider cytoplasmic vestibule have been hindered by the lack of a high-affinity blocker that interacts with residues in this area. In this study we show that venom of the scorpion Leiurus quinquestriatus hebraeus reversibly inhibits CFTR, in a voltage-independent manner, by decreasing single-channel mean burst duration and open probability only when applied to the cytoplasmic surface of phosphorylated channels. Venom was able to decrease burst duration and open probability even when CFTR channels were locked open by treatment with either vanadate or adenosine 5{${'}$}-({$\beta$}, {$\gamma$}-imido)-triphosphate, and block was strengthened on reduction of extracellular Cl- concentration, suggesting inhibition by a pore-block mechanism. Venom had no effect on ATP-dependent macroscopic opening rate in channels studied by inside-out macropatches. Interestingly, the inhibitory activity was abolished by proteinase treatment. We conclude that a peptide toxin contained in the scorpion venom inhibits CFTR channels by a pore-block mechanism; these experiments provide the first step toward isolation of the active component, which would be highly valuable as a probe for CFTR structure and function.},

  abstract = {Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is a chloride channel belonging to the ATP binding cassette (ABC) protein superfamily. Currently, it remains unclear how ATP binding causes the opening of the channel gate at the molecular level. To clarify this mechanism, we first constructed an atomic model of the inward-facing CFTR using the X-ray structures of other ABC proteins. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were then performed to explore the structure and dynamics of the inward-facing CFTR in a membrane environment. In the MgATP-bound state, two nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs) formed a head-to-tail type of dimer, in which the ATP molecules were sandwiched between the Walker A and signature motifs. Alternatively, one of the final MD structures in the apo state was similar to that of a "closed-apo" conformation found in the X-ray analysis of ATP-free MsbA. Principal component analysis for the MD trajectory indicated that NBD dimerization causes significant structural and dynamical changes in the transmembrane domains (TMDs), which is likely indicative of the formation of a chloride ion access path. This study suggests that the free energy gain from ATP binding acts as a driving force not only for NBD dimerization but also for NBD-TMD concerted motions. \textcopyright{} 2012 American Chemical Society.}

ATP-driven conformational changes, which in other ABC proteins fuel uphill substrate transport across cellular membranes, in CFTR open and close a gate to allow transmembrane flow of anions down their electrochemical gradient. New structural and biochemical information from prokaryotic ABC proteins and functional information from CFTR channels has led to a unifying mechanism explaining those ATP-driven conformational changes. \textcopyright 2006 Nature Publishing Group.},

  abstract = {Experimental and computational studies have painted a picture of the chloride permeation pathway in cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) as a short narrow tunnel flanked by wider inner and outer vestibules. Although these studies also identified a number of transmembrane segments (TMs) as porelining, the exact location of CFTR's gate(s) remains unknown. Here, using a channel-permeant probe, [Au(CN)2]-, we provide evidence that CFTR bears a gate that coincides with the predicted narrow section of the pore defined as residues 338-341 in TM6. Specifically, cysteines introduced cytoplasmic to the narrow region (i.e., positions 344 in TM6 and 1148 in TM12) can be modified by intracellular [Au(CN)2]-, in both open and closed states, corroborating the conclusion that the internal vestibule does not harbor a gate. However, cysteines engineered to positions external to the presumed narrow region (e.g., 334, 335, and 337 in TM6) are all nonreactive toward cytoplasmic [Au(CN)2]-, in the absence of ATP, whereas they can be better accessed by extracellular [Au(CN)2]-, when the open probability ismarkedly reduced by introducing a second mutation, G1349D. As [Au(CN)2]-, and chloride ions share the same permeation pathway, these results imply a gate is situated between amino acid residues 337 and 344 along TM6, encompassing the very segment that may also serve as the selectivity filter for CFTR. The unique position of a gate in the middle of the ion translocation pathway diverges from those seen in ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters and thus distinguishes CFTR from other members of the ABC transporter family.},

Here, we use a simulation box size as an independent variable, to demonstrate how crucial it is to gather sufficient amounts of data before drawing any conclusions about the potential thermodynamic and kinetic effects. In various systems, ranging from solvation free energies to protein conformational transition rates, we showcase how the proposed simulation box size effect disappears with increased sampling. This indicates that, if at all, the simulation box size only minimally affects both the thermodynamics and kinetics of the type of biomolecular systems presented in this work.},

The proposed ionothermal protocol is attractive and environmental friendly because ChCl and urea are naturally biocompatible compounds. It has been reported that Ni(NH\textbackslash textlessinf\textbackslash textgreater3\textbackslash textless/inf\textbackslash textgreater)\textbackslash textlessinf\textbackslash textgreater6\textbackslash textless/inf\textbackslash textgreaterCl\textbackslash textlessinf\textbackslash textgreater2\textbackslash textless/inf\textbackslash textgreater is an indirect and reversible hydrogen storage material for fuel cells.

Interestingly, with the addition of a small amount of water into the primal solution which has been kept at 150 \textdegree C and open to the air for 40 minutes, NF {$\alpha$}-Ni(OH)\textbackslash textlessinf\textbackslash textgreater2\textbackslash textless/inf\textbackslash textgreater can be obtained. Further annealing of the NF {$\alpha$}-Ni(OH)\textbackslash textlessinf\textbackslash textgreater2\textbackslash textless/inf\textbackslash textgreater at 300 \textdegree C leads to the formation of NF-NiO with a mesoporous structure, which is demonstrated to be a promising pseudo-capacitive electrode material in a KOH aqueous solution. The rapid activation process, good cycling performance, and high specific capacitance of the NF-NiO electrode are attributed to its high surface area (72.9 m\textbackslash textlesssup\textbackslash textgreater2\textbackslash textless/sup\textbackslash textgreater g\textbackslash textlesssup\textbackslash textgreater-1\textbackslash textless/sup\textbackslash textgreater) and the mesoporous structure. We expect that the ionothermal method will have implications for the use of ChCl-urea mixture-based ionic liquids in the large-scale synthesis of advanced functional materials. \textcopyright{} The Royal Society of Chemistry 2013.}

By site-directed mutagenesis, we generated four CFTR variants in the N-terminal cytoplasmic tail (p.P5L, p.S50P, p.E60K, and p.R75Q) and four in the first transmembrane segment of membrane-spanning domain 1 (p.G85E/V, p.Y89C, and p.E92K). Immunoblot analysis revealed that p.S50P, p.E60K, p.G85E/V, and p.E92K produced only core-glycosylated proteins. Immunofluorescence and whole cell patch-clamp confirmed intracellular retention, thus reflecting a defect of CFTR folding and/or trafficking. In contrast, both p.R75Q and p.Y89C had a glycosylation pattern and a subcellular distribution comparable to the wild-type CFTR, while the percentage of mature p.P5L was considerably reduced, suggesting a major biogenesis flaw on this channel. Nevertheless, whole-cell chloride currents were recorded for all three variants. Single-channel patch-clamp analyses revealed that the channel activity of p.R75Q appeared similar to that of the wild-type CFTR, while both p.P5L and p.Y89C channels displayed abnormal gating. Overall, our results predict a major impact of the CFTR missense variants analyzed, except p.R75Q, on the CF phenotype and highlight the importance of the CFTR N-terminus on channel physiology. \textcopyright{} 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

  abstract = {A versatile ionothermal strategy is proposed to synthesize nanostructured nickel compounds as energy storage materials, such as Ni(NH3) 6Cl2 crystals, nanosheet-like NiCl2, nanoflower-like (NF) {$\alpha$}-Ni(OH)2, and mesoporous NF-NiO. The primal solution is a choline chloride (ChCl)-urea mixture-based ionic liquid with nickel chloride hexahydrate (NiCl2{$\cdot$}6H2O) dissolved. The proposed ionothermal protocol is attractive and environmental friendly because ChCl and urea are naturally biocompatible compounds. It has been reported that Ni(NH3)6Cl2 is an indirect and reversible hydrogen storage material for fuel cells. Herein, we demonstrate that Ni(NH3)6Cl2 crystals with octahedral geometry and an open structure can be obtained by maintaining the primal solution in a sealed vessel at 150 \textdegree C for 4 hours. A kinetic-to-dynamic growth mechanism is proposed to elucidate the formation of the interesting Ni(NH3)6Cl2 structure. Further annealing of the Ni(NH3)6Cl2 crystals at 300 \textdegree C produces sheet-like NiCl2, which can be utilized as an active material in sodium-ion batteries. Interestingly, with the addition of a small amount of water into the primal solution which has been kept at 150 \textdegree C and open to the air for 40 minutes, NF {$\alpha$}-Ni(OH)2 can be obtained. Further annealing of the NF {$\alpha$}-Ni(OH)2 at 300 \textdegree C leads to the formation of NF-NiO with a mesoporous structure, which is demonstrated to be a promising pseudo-capacitive electrode material in a KOH aqueous solution. The rapid activation process, good cycling performance, and high specific capacitance of the NF-NiO electrode are attributed to its high surface area (72.9 m2 g-1) and the mesoporous structure. We expect that the ionothermal method will have implications for the use of ChCl-urea mixture-based ionic liquids in the large-scale synthesis of advanced functional materials. \textcopyright{} The Royal Society of Chemistry 2013.}

We here introduce a novel method where concurrent metadynamics are integrated in a Hamiltonian replica-exchange scheme. The ladder of replicas is built with different strengths of the bias potential exploiting the tunability of well-tempered metadynamics. Using this method, free-energy barriers of individual collective variables are significantly reduced compared with simple force-field scaling. The introduced methodology is flexible and allows adaptive bias potentials to be self-consistently constructed for a large number of simple collective variables, such as distances and dihedral angles. The method is tested on alanine dipeptide and applied to the difficult problem of conformational sampling in a tetranucleotide.},

The aim of this in vitro study was to evaluate the effect of ivacaftor on mutant CFTR protein forms with defects in protein processing and/or channel function. Methods The effect of ivacaftor on CFTR function was tested in electrophysiological studies using a panel of Fischer rat thyroid (FRT) cells expressing 54 missense CFTR mutations that cause defects in the amount or function of CFTR at the cell surface. Results Ivacaftor potentiated multiple mutant CFTR protein forms that produce functional CFTR at the cell surface. These included mutant CFTR forms with mild defects in CFTR processing or mild defects in CFTR channel conductance. Conclusions These in vitro data indicated that ivacaftor is a broad acting CFTR potentiator and could be used to help stratify patients with CF who have different CFTR genotypes for studies investigating the potential clinical benefit of ivacaftor.},

In agreement with the experiments that demonstrate the influence of electrostatic potential on the thrombin/aptamer complex, our computations show that the application of positive electric field successfully unbinds the thrombin from the aptamer. Results from umbrella sampling simulations reveal that there is a decrease in the free energy of binding between the thrombin and aptamer in presence of positive electric fields. Hydrogen bonding and non-bonded interaction energies, and hence the free energy of binding, between the thrombin and its aptamer reduce as the applied electric field is shifted from negative to positive values. Our analyses demonstrate that application of electrical stimulus modifies the molecular interactions within the complex and consequently, electrical field can be used to modulate the association between the thrombin and its aptamer.}

  abstract = {We present a method to predict complex structural (conformational) transitions in irregular or disordered macromolecular systems, such as proteins or glasses, at the atomic level. Our method aims at rare events, which currently cannot be predicted with traditional molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, since these currently are limited to time scales shorter than a few nanoseconds. Given an initial conformation of the system, our method identifies one or more product states, which may be separated from the initial state by free energy barriers that are large on the scale of thermal energy. It also provides an approximate reaction path, which can be used to determine barrier heights or reaction rates with the usual techniques. The method employs an artificial potential that destabilizes the initial conformation and, thereby, lowers free energy barriers of structural transitions. As a result, transitions are accelerated and may be observed in MD simulations. An analytical estimate for the acceleration factor is given. The method is applied to two test systems, an argon microcluster and a simplified protein model. By these studies we demonstrated that our method is capable of shortening mean transition times from 0.5 s (argon cluster) and 1.4 ns (protein model) to a few picoseconds. These results suggest that our method is particularly well suited to study biochemically relevant conformational motions in proteins at a microsecond time scale. \textcopyright{} 1995 The American Physical Society.}

We investigated the role of Arg352, a residue flanking the predicted cytoplasmic end of the M6 segment, in the mechanism of charge selectivity. We determined the Cl- to Na+ permeability ratio (P(Cl)/P(Na)) from the reversal potential measured in a 10-fold NaCl gradient. For the wild type, P(Cl)/P(Na) was 36 (range of 28-51). For the R352H mutant, P(Cl)/P(Na) was dependent on cytoplasmic pH. At pH 5.4, the P(Cl)/P(Na) was 33 (range of 27-41), similar to that of the wild type, but at pH 7.2, where the histidine should be largely uncharged, P(Cl)/P(Na) was 3 (range of 2.9-3.1). For the R352C and R352Q mutants, P(Cl)/P(Na) was 7 (range of 6-8) and 4 (range of 3.5-4.4), respectively. Furthermore, Na+ which does not carry a significant fraction of the current through the wild type is measurably conducted through R352Q. Thus, the charge of the side chain at position 352 is a strong determinant of charge selectivity. In the wild type, the positive charge on Arg352 contributes to an electrostatic potential in the channel that forms a barrier to cation permeation. Mutation of Arg352 did not alter the halide selectivity sequence. Selectivity among halides must involve other residues.}

In this review, some relatively simple molecular dyads that mimic certain aspects of photosynthetic electron transfer and singlet or triplet energy transfer are described. Dyads of this type have proven to be extremely useful for elucidating basic photochemical principles. In addition, their limitations, particularly in the area of temporal stabilization of electronic charge separation, have inspired the development of much more complex multicomponent molecular devices. The use of the basic principles of photoinitiated electron transfer to engineer desirable properties into the more complex species is exemplified. The multiple electrontransfer pathways available with these molecules make it possible to fine-tune the systems in ways that are impossible with simpler molecules. The study of these devices not only contributes to our understanding of natural photosynthesis, but also aids in the design of artificial solar energy harvesting systems and provides an entry into the nascent field of molecular electronics.},

  abstract = {Deep eutectic solvents (DESs) have been used in the synthesis of nitrogen-doped carbons exhibiting a hierarchical porous structure. The CO 2 sorption capacity of these solid sorbents was extraordinary because of their relatively high nitrogen content and their bimodal porous structure where micropores provide high surface areas (ca. 700 m 2 g -1) and macropores provide accessibility to such a surface. DESs were composed of resorcinol, 3-hydroxypyridine and choline chloride in 2:2:1 and 1:1:1 molar ratios. Polycondensation of resorcinol and 3-hydroxypyridine (with formaldehyde) promoted DES segregation in a spinodal-like decomposition process by the formation of a polymer rich phase and a depleted polymer phase. Thus, DESs played a multiple role in the synthetic process; the liquid medium that ensured reagents homogenization, the structure-directing agent that is responsible for the achievement of the hierarchical structure, and the source of carbon and nitrogen of the solid sorbent obtained after carbonization. Interestingly, the homogeneous incorporation of nitrogen at the solution stage of the synthetic process (rather than by post-treatment of the preformed carbon) allowed the achievement of significant nitrogen contents even in carbons obtained at relatively high temperatures (e.g. 8-12 at\% for 600 \textdegree C and ca. 5 at\% for 800 \textdegree C). It is worth noting that, despite thermal treatments at high temperatures tend to decrease the nitrogen content, the high surface area of the solid sorbents obtained at 800 \textdegree C contributed to a significant enhancement of CO 2 capture while providing superior selectivity, recyclability and stability. \textcopyright{} 2011 The Royal Society of Chemistry.}

Four DESs were prepared by combining tetrabutylammonium bromide or methyltriphenylphosphonium bromide with ethylene glycol, triethylene glycol, or sulfolane. All DESs showed good ability to extract thiophene with the best extraction efficiency (35\%) being observed for the sulfolane-based DES. The extraction efficiency can be further enhanced to reach 98\% when five extraction cycles are performed. Moreover, the DESs were easily regenerated using rotary evaporation. In addition,1H NMR analysis is used to elucidate the extraction mechanism. Finally, the COSMO-RS model was used to predict the ternary tie lines for the studied systems and the NRTL model allowed, correlating the experimental data with an average root-mean-square deviation of {$<$}2\% for all DESs. These models can be utilized for further simulation analysis of the extraction process.}

This article illustrates concepts and results of geometric numerical integration on the important example of the St\"ormer\textendash Verlet method. It thus presents a cross-section of the recent monograph by the authors, enriched by some additional material.             After an introduction to the Newton\textendash St\"ormer\textendash Verlet\textendash leapfrog method and its various interpretations, there follows a discussion of geometric properties: reversibility, symplecticity, volume preservation, and conservation of first integrals. The extension to Hamiltonian systems on manifolds is also described. The theoretical foundation relies on a backward error analysis, which translates the geometric properties of the method into the structure of a modified differential equation, whose flow is nearly identical to the numerical method. Combined with results from perturbation theory, this explains the excellent long-time behaviour of the method: long-time energy conservation, linear error growth and preservation of invariant tori in near-integrable systems, a discrete virial theorem, and preservation of adiabatic invariants.},

  abstract = {The outlier flooding method (OFLOOD) has been proposed as an enhanced conformational sampling method of proteins. In OFLOOD, rarely occurring states of proteins are detected as sparse conformational distributions (outliers) with a clustering algorithm. The detected outliers are intensively resampled with short-time molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. As a set of cycles, OFLOOD repeats selections of outliers and their conformational resampling. Herein, as an essential issue to be tackled to perform OFLOOD efficiently, a selection rule for outliers should be carefully specified. Generally, many outliers are detected from distributions on conformational subspaces with the clustering. Judging from its computational costs, it is unreasonable to select all the detected outliers upon the conformational resampling. Therefore, it is important to consider which outliers should be selected from the sparse distributions when restarting their short-time MD simulations with limited computational costs. In this sense, we investigated the conformational sampling efficiency of OFLOOD by changing the selection rules for outliers. To address the conformational sampling efficiency of OFLOOD depending on its selection rules, outliers to be resampled were selected by focusing their probability occurrences (populations of outliers). As a comparison, a random selection rule for outliers was also considered. Through the present assessment, the random selection of outliers showed the most efficient conformational sampling efficiency compared to the other OFLOOD trials using the biased selection rules, indicating that a variety of outliers should be selected and resampled during the OFLOOD cycles. In conclusion, the random outlier selection rule is the best strategy to perform OFLOOD efficiently.}

  abstract = {The multilevel summation method (MSM) offers an efficient algorithm utilizing convolution for evaluating long-range forces arising in molecular dynamics simulations. Shifting the balance of computation and communication, MSM provides key advantages over the ubiquitous particle-mesh Ewald (PME) method, offering better scaling on parallel computers and permitting more modeling flexibility, with support for periodic systems as does PME but also for semiperiodic and nonperiodic systems. The version of MSM available in the simulation program NAMD is described, and its performance and accuracy are compared with the PME method. The accuracy feasible for MSM in practical applications reproduces PME results for water property calculations of density, diffusion constant, dielectric constant, surface tension, radial distribution function, and distancedependent Kirkwood factor, even though the numerical accuracy of PME is higher than that of MSM. Excellent agreement between MSM and PME is found also for interface potentials of air-water and membrane-water interfaces, where long-range Coulombic interactions are crucial. Applications demonstrate also the suitability of MSM for systems with semiperiodic and nonperiodic boundaries. For this purpose, simulations have been performed with periodic boundaries along directions parallel to a membrane surface but not along the surface normal, yielding membrane pore formation induced by an imbalance of charge across the membrane. Using a similar semiperiodic boundary condition, ion conduction through a graphene nanopore driven by an ion gradient has been simulated. Furthermore, proteins have been simulated inside a single spherical water droplet. Finally, parallel scalability results show the ability of MSM to outperform PME when scaling a system of modest size (less than 100 K atoms) to over a thousand processors, demonstrating the suitability of MSM for large-scale parallel simulation.},

In this study, deep eutectic solvents (DESs) were considered as new green media for chemical processes. Solvatochromic behavior was investigated at 25 \textdegree C over the whole range of mole fractions of binary mixtures of dimethyl sulfoxide with urea-choline chloride (reline), ethylene glycol-choline chloride (ethaline), and glycerol-choline chloride (glyceline) with as common DESs. In these DESs the molar ratio of choline chloride to urea, ethylene glycol and glycerol is 1:2.

  abstract = {Molecular dynamics simulations of biomolecules produce a very high dimensional time-series dataset. Performing analysis necessarily involves projection onto a lower dimensional space. A priori selection of projection coordinates requires (perhaps unavailable) prior information or intuition about the system. At best, such a projection can only confirm the intuition. At worst, a poor projection can obscure new features of the system absent from the intuition. Previous statistical methods such a time-structure based independent component analysis (tICA) and Markov state modeling (MSMs) have offered relatively unbiased means of projecting conformations onto coordinates or state labels, respectively. These analyses are underpinned by the propagator formalism and the assumption that slow dynamics are biologically interesting. Although arising from the same mathematics, tICA and MSMs have different strengths and weaknesses. We introduce a unifying method which we term ``landmark kernel tICA'' (lktICA) which uses a variant of the Nystr\"om kernel approximation to permit approximate non-linear solutions to the tICA problem. We show that lktICA is equivalent to MSMs with ``soft'' states. We demonstrate the advantages of this united method by finding improved projections of (a) a 1D potential surface (b) a peptide folding trajectory and (c) an ion channel conformational change.}

The reaction, which involves gamma phosphate cleavage from ATP, converting it to ADP, has been suggested to occur via an associative or dissociative mechanism dependent upon the surrounding environment. Prior quantum chemical studies suffered from short simulation time scales failing to capture free energy contributions due to relaxation of the surrounding aqueous environment. We have developed a highly parallelized QM/MM implementation in the NAMD and OpenAtom simulation packages, using the dual grid, dual length scale method for combined plane-wave and Euler exponential spline-based QM/MM simulations. This approach, using message-driven parallel quantum and classical dynamics, permits sufficient time scale simulations for quantum chemical events such as ATP hydrolysis and is found to accurately and reliably include the free energy contributions of solvent relaxation to hydrolysis. In this paper, we describe the application of the dual grid, dual length plane-wave-based QM/MM method to study both the associative and dissociative mechanisms of ATP hydrolysis, accounting for the free energy contribution from solvent relaxation, as well as for the key role of Mg 2+ in the reaction. \textcopyright{} 2012 American Chemical Society.}

  abstract = {The spliceosome is a highly dynamic macromolecular complex that precisely excises introns from pre-mRNA. Here we report the cryo-EM 3D structure of the human Bact spliceosome at 3.4 \AA{} resolution. In the Bact state, the spliceosome is activated but not catalytically primed, so that it is functionally blocked prior to the first catalytic step of splicing. The spliceosomal core is similar to the yeast Bact spliceosome; important differences include the presence of the RNA helicase aquarius and peptidyl prolyl isomerases. To examine the overall dynamic behavior of the purified spliceosome, we developed a principal component analysis-based approach. Calculating the energy landscape revealed eight major conformational states, which we refined to higher resolution. Conformational differences of the highly flexible structural components between these eight states reveal how spliceosomal components contribute to the assembly of the spliceosome, allowing it to generate a dynamic interaction network required for its subsequent catalytic activation. A new approach to analyzing cryo-EM data reports on conformational dynamics in the human spliceosome.}

Strong fields greatly disturb the water orientation in the hydration shells of ions, though ion coordination number remains almost unchanged. Under strong fields, the first hydration shell of ions is significantly weakened and the ion-water interaction energy is dramatically reduced; surprisingly, the second hydration shells of Cl- and Na+ are slightly structured because of the optimal water orientation; moreover, ionic hydration structures become asymmetrical along the field direction because of the uniformly aligned water dipoles. Compared with Na+ and Pb2+, the hydration of Cl- is less disturbed by external fields, probably ascribed to the different water reorientation around anions and cations as well as the different structure-maker/breaker nature of the ions.

CFTR is novel in the ATP-binding cassette superfamily as an ion channel that is enabled by a unique unstructured regulatory domain. This R domain contains multiple protein kinase A sites, which when phosphorylated allow channel gating. Most of the sites have been indicated to stimulate channel activity, while two of them have been suggested to be inhibitory. It is unknown whether individual sites act coordinately or distinctly. To address this issue, we raised monoclonal antibodies recognizing the unphosphorylated, but not the phosphorylated states of four functionally relevant sites (700, 737, 768, and 813). This enabled simultaneous monitoring of their phosphorylation and dephosphorylation and revealed that both processes occurred rapidly at the first three sites, but more slowly at the fourth. The parallel phosphorylation rates of the stimulatory 700 and the putative inhibitory 737 and 768 sites prompted us to reexamine the role of the latter two. With serines 737 and 768 reintroduced individually into a PKA insensitive variant, in which serines at 15 sites had been replaced by alanines, a level of channel activation by PKA was restored, showing that these sites can mediate stimulation.

Chaperones of the Hsp70 class and their partner proteins interact with nascent polypeptide chains on ribosomes and prevent their premature (mis)folding at least until a domain capable of forming a stable structure is synthesized. For many proteins, completion of folding requires the subsequent interaction with one of the large oligomeric ring-shaped proteins of the chaperonin family, which is composed of the GroEL-like proteins in eubacteria, mitochondria, and chloroplasts, and the TRiC family in eukaryotic cytosol and archaea. These proteins bind partially folded polypeptide in their central cavity and promote folding by ATP-dependent cycles of release and rebinding. In these reactions, molecular chaperones interact predominantly with the hydrophobic surfaces exposed by nonnative polypeptides, thereby preventing incorrect folding and aggregation.},

  abstract = {In this article, we present a new LINear Constraint Solver (LINCS) for molecular simulations with bond constraints. The algorithm is inherently stable, as the constraints themselves are reset instead of derivatives of the constraints, thereby eliminating drift. Although the derivation of the algorithm is presented in terms of matrices, no matrix matrix multiplications are needed and only the nonzero matrix elements have to be stored, making the method useful for very large molecules. At the same accuracy, the LINCS algorithm is three to four times faster than the SHAKE algorithm. Parallelization of the algorithm is straightforward. \textcopyright{} 1997 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.

  abstract = {Most proteins assemble into multisubunit complexes1. The persistence of these complexes across evolutionary time is usually explained as the result of natural selection for functional properties that depend on multimerization, such as intersubunit allostery or the capacity to do mechanical work2. In many complexes, however, multimerization does not enable any known function3. An alternative explanation is that multimers could become entrenched if substitutions accumulate that are neutral in multimers but deleterious in monomers; purifying selection would then prevent reversion to the unassembled form, even if assembly per se does not enhance biological function3\textendash 7. Here we show that a hydrophobic mutational ratchet systematically entrenches molecular complexes. By applying ancestral protein reconstruction and biochemical assays to the evolution of steroid hormone receptors, we show that an ancient hydrophobic interface, conserved for hundreds of millions of years, is entrenched because exposure of this interface to solvent reduces protein stability and causes aggregation, even though the interface makes no detectable contribution to function. Using structural bioinformatics, we show that a universal mutational propensity drives sites that are buried in multimeric interfaces to accumulate hydrophobic substitutions to levels that are not tolerated in monomers. In a database of hundreds of families of multimers, most show signatures of long-term hydrophobic entrenchment. It is therefore likely that many protein complexes persist because a simple ratchet-like mechanism entrenches them across evolutionary time, even when they are functionally gratuitous.},

Can a self, a soul, a consciousness, an "I" arise out of mere matter? If it cannot, then how can you or I be here? This book argues that the key to understanding selves and consciousness is a special kind of abstract feedback loop inhabiting our brains. Deep down, a human brain is a chaotic soup of particles, on a higher level it is a jungle of neurons, and on a yet higher level it is a network of abstractions that we call "symbols." The most central and complex symbol in your brain or mine is the one we both call "I." But how can such a mysterious abstraction be real--or is our "I" merely a convenient fiction?--From publisher description},

These simulations capture the behavior of proteins and other biomolecules in full atomic detail and at very fine temporal resolution. Major improvements in simulation speed, accuracy, and accessibility, together with the proliferation of experimental structural data, have increased the appeal of biomolecular simulation to experimentalists\textemdash a trend particularly noticeable in , though certainly not limited to, neuroscience. Simulations have proven valuable in deciphering functional mechanisms of proteins and other biomolecules, in uncovering the structural basis for disease, and in the design and optimization of small molecules, peptides, and proteins. Here we describe in practical terms the types of information MD simulations can provide and the ways in which they typically motivate further experimental work.},

  abstract = {Previous studies have shown that the method of hydrogen mass repartitioning (HMR) is a potentially useful tool for accelerating molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. By repartitioning the mass of heavy atoms into the bonded hydrogen atoms, it is possible to slow the highest-frequency motions of the macromolecule under study, thus allowing the time step of the simulation to be increased by up to a factor of 2. In this communication, we investigate further how this mass repartitioning allows the simulation time step to be increased in a stable fashion without significantly increasing discretization error. To this end, we ran a set of simulations with different time steps and mass distributions on a three-residue peptide to get a comprehensive view of the effect of mass repartitioning and time step increase on a system whose accessible phase space is fully explored in a relatively short amount of time. We next studied a 129-residue protein, hen egg white lysozyme (HEWL), to verify that the observed behavior extends to a larger, more-realistic, system. Results for the protein include structural comparisons from MD trajectories, as well as comparisons of pKa calculations via constant-pH MD. We also calculated a potential of mean force (PMF) of a dihedral rotation for the MTS [(1-oxyl-2,2,5,5-tetramethyl-pyrroline-3-methyl)methanethiosulfonate] spin label via umbrella sampling with a set of regular MD trajectories, as well as a set of mass-repartitioned trajectories with a time step of 4 fs. Since no significant difference in kinetics or thermodynamics is observed by the use of fast HMR trajectories, further evidence is provided that long-time-step HMR MD simulations are a viable tool for accelerating MD simulations for molecules of biochemical interest.},

The specificity of these heterophil reactions for I.M. was investigated by determining antibodies to Epstein-Barr virus-determined antigens, i.e., to viral capsid antigens (VCA), early antigens (EA), and EBV-associated nuclear antigens (EBNA). On the basis of detectable anti-EA and/or the early absence and late emergence of anti-EBNA, four of these 14 individuals showed evidence of a current or very recent primary Epstein-Barr virus infection. The other ten patients showed antibody patterns indicative of Epstein-Barr virus infections in the past, and no firm conclusions could be drawn with regard to the specificity of their heterophil reactions. It was assumed, however, that some represented atypical clinical forms of EBV infection and that timing of specimen collection was a factor in explaining the paucity of Downey cells. In three patients, the absorbed heterophil-positive reactions persisted with little change in titer for at least 22 mo and thus might represent false-positive tests.},

  abstract = {Ewald summation, which has become the de facto standard for computing electrostatic interactions in biomolecular simulations, formally requires that the simulation box is neutral. For non-neutral systems, the Ewald algorithm implicitly introduces a uniform background charge distribution that effectively neutralizes the simulation box. Because a uniform distribution of counter charges typically deviates from the spatial distribution of counterions in real systems, artifacts may arise, in particular in systems with an inhomogeneous dielectric constant. Here, we derive an analytical expression for the effect of using an implicit background charge instead of explicit counterions, on the chemical potential of ions in heterogeneous systems, which (i) provides a quantitative criterium for deciding if the background charge offers an acceptable trade-off between artifacts arising from sampling problems and artifacts arising from the homogeneous background charge distribution, and (ii) can be used to correct this artifact in certain cases. Our model quantifies the artifact in terms of the difference in charge density between the non-neutral system with a uniform neutralizing background charge and the real neutral system with a physically correct distribution of explicit counterions. We show that for inhomogeneous systems, such as proteins and membranes in water, the artifact manifests itself by an overstabilization of ions inside the lower dielectric by tens to even hundreds kilojoules per mole. We have tested the accuracy of our model in molecular dynamics simulations and found that the error in the calculated free energy for moving a test charge from water into hexadecane, at different net charges of the system and different simulation box sizes, is correctly predicted by the model. The calculations further confirm that the incorrect distribution of counter charges in the simulation box is solely responsible for the errors in the PMFs.},

Extracellular gate opening and closure are key steps of the transport cycle, but the underlying mechanism is poorly understood. Here, we generated a synthetic single domain antibody (sybody) that recognizes the heterodimeric ABC exporter TM287/288 exclusively in the presence of ATP, which was essential to solve a 3.2\,\AA{} crystal structure of the outward-facing transporter. The sybody binds to an extracellular wing and strongly inhibits ATPase activity by shifting the transporter's conformational equilibrium towards the outward-facing state, as shown by double electron-electron resonance (DEER). Mutations that facilitate extracellular gate opening result in a comparable equilibrium shift and strongly reduce ATPase activity and drug transport. Using the sybody as conformational probe, we demonstrate that efficient extracellular gate closure is required to dissociate the NBD dimer after ATP hydrolysis to reset the transporter back to its inward-facing state.},

First, it is the only ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter that is known to be an ion channel-almost all others function as transport ATPases. Second, CFTR is the only ligand-gated channel that consumes its ligand (ATP) during the gating cycle-a consequence of its enzymatic activity as an ABC transporter. We discuss these special properties of CFTR in the context of its evolutionary history as an ABC transporter. Other topics include the mechanisms by which CFTR gating is regulated by phosphorylation of its unique regulatory domain and our current view of the CFTR permeation pathway (or pore). Understanding these basic operating principles of the CFTR channel is central to defining the mechanisms of action of prospective cystic fibrosis drugs and to the development of new, rational treatment strategies. \textcopyright{} 2013 Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press; all rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is an ATP-gated anion channel with two remarkable distinctions. First, it is the only ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter that is known to be an ion channel-almost all others function as transport ATPases. Second, CFTR is the only ligand-gated channel that consumes its ligand (ATP) during the gating cycle-a consequence of its enzymatic activity as an ABC transporter. We discuss these special properties of CFTR in the context of its evolutionary history as an ABC transporter. Other topics include the mechanisms by which CFTR gating is regulated by phosphorylation of its unique regulatory domain and our current view of the CFTR permeation pathway (or pore). Understanding these basic operating principles of the CFTR channel is central to defining the mechanisms of action of prospective cystic fibrosis drugs and to the development of new, rational treatment strategies. \textcopyright{} 2013 Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press; all rights reserved.}

We propose here a change in perspective that shifts the focus from the bias to the probability distribution reconstruction while retaining some of the key characteristics of metadynamics, such as flexible on-the-fly adjustments to the free energy estimate. The result is an enhanced sampling method that presents a drastic improvement in convergence speed, especially when dealing with suboptimal and/or multidimensional sets of collective variables. The method is especially robust and easy to use and in fact requires only a few simple parameters to be set, and it has a straightforward reweighting scheme to recover the statistics of the unbiased ensemble. Furthermore, it gives more control of the desired exploration of the phase space since the deposited bias is not allowed to grow indefinitely and it does not push the simulation to uninteresting high free energy regions. We demonstrate the performance of the method in a number of representative examples.},

Mutations in CFTR cause impaired chloride ion transport in the epithelial tissues of patients leading to cardiopulmonary decline and pancreatic insufficiency in the most severely affected patients. CFTR is composed of twelve membrane-spanning domains, two nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs), and a regulatory domain. The most common mutation in CFTR is a deletion of phenylalanine at position 508 ({$\delta$}F508) in NBD1. Previous research has primarily concentrated on the structure and dynamics of the NBD1 domain; However numerous pathological mutations have also been found in the lesser-studied NBD2 domain. We have investigated the amino acid coevolved network of interactions in NBD2, and the changes that occur in that network upon the introduction of CF and CF-related mutations (S1251N(T), S1235R, D1270N, N1303K (T)). Extensive coupling between the {$\alpha$}- and {$\beta$}-subdomains were identified with residues in, or near Walker A, Walker B, H-loop and C-loop motifs. Alterations in the predicted residue network varied from moderate for the S1251T perturbation to more severe for N1303T. The S1235R and D1270N networks varied greatly compared to the wildtype, but these CF mutations only affect ion transport preference and do not severely disrupt CFTR function, suggesting dynamic flexibility in the network of interactions in NBD2. Our results also suggest that inappropriate interactions between the {$\beta$}-subdomain and Q-loop could be detrimental. We also identified mutations predicted to stabilize the NBD2 residue network upon introduction of the CF and CF-related mutations, and these predicted mutations are scored as benign by the MUTPRED2 algorithm. Our results suggest the level of disruption of the coevolution predictions of the amino acid networks in NBD2 does not have a straightforward correlation with the severity of the CF phenotypes observed.}

All the strains tested contained at least one malic enzyme. The NADP-linked enzyme activity was found in all the strains except C. tetanomorphum, the NAD-linked enzyme activity in 12 strains--8 strains of enteric bacteria, 2 strains of Pseudomonas, Ag. tumefaciens, and C. tetanomorphum--and D-malic enzyme activity in 4 strains--A, aerogenes (IFO 3319 and 12059), Ps. fluorescens, and R. rubrum. The NADP-linked and NAD-linked enzyme activities of two strains of Pseudomonas were not separated by the chromatography. The available evidence suggested that the NAD, NADP-linked enzyme was not present in these 16 strains. The comparative studies of molecular, enzymatic, and serological properties of the malic enzymes in these 16 strains revealed a close similarity of the same types of malic enzymes among enteric bacteria.},

Here, we develop a multiscale approach combining numerous atomistic simulations in explicit solvent to construct Markov State Models (MSMs) of fibril growth. The search for the in-register fully bound fibril state is modeled as a random walk on a rugged two-dimensional energy landscape defined by {$\beta$}-sheet alignment and hydrogen-bonding states, whereas transitions involving states without hydrogen bonds are derived from kinetic clustering. The reversible association/dissociation of an incoming peptide and overall growth kinetics are then computed from MSM simulations. This approach is applied to derive a parameter-free, comprehensive description of fibril elongation of A{$\beta$}16\textendash 22 and how it is modulated by phenylalanine-to-cyclohexylalanine (CHA) mutations. The trajectories show an aggregation mechanism in which the peptide spends most of its time trapped in misregistered {$\beta$}-sheet states connected by weakly bound states twith short lifetimes. Our results recapitulate the experimental observation that mutants CHA19 and CHA1920 accelerate fibril elongation but have a relatively minor effect on the critical concentration for fibril growth. Importantly, the kinetic consequences of mutations arise from cumulative effects of perturbing the network of productive and nonproductive pathways of fibril growth. This is consistent with the expectation that nonfunctional states will not have evolved efficient folding pathways and, therefore, will require a random search of configuration space.

One computationally efficient treatment is based on the classical Drude oscillator in which an auxiliary charged particle is attached by a spring to each nucleus. Here, we report the first implementation of this model in the program NAMD. An extended Lagrangian dynamics with a dual-Langevin thermostat scheme applied to the Drude-nucleus pairs is employed to efficiently generate classical dynamic propagation near the self-consistent field limit. Large-scale MD simulations based on the Drude polarizable force field scale very well on massively distributed supercomputing platforms, the computational demand increasing by only a factor of 1.2 to 1.8 compared to nonpolarizable models. As an illustration, a large-scale 150 mM NaCl aqueous salt solution is simulated, and the calculated ionic conductivity is shown to be in excellent agreement with experiment.},

The model can fully explain recent experimental data, and it predicts cellular volume and pressure for several models of cell cortical mechanics. Moreover, we show that when cells are subjected to an externally applied load, such as in an atomic force microscopy indentation experiment, active regulation of volume and pressure leads to a complex cellular response. Instead of the passive mechanics of the cortex, the observed cell stiffness depends on several factors working together. This provides a mathematical explanation of rate-dependent response of cells under force.},

  abstract = {Proteins are essential to life, and understanding their structure can facilitate a mechanistic understanding of their function. Through an enormous experimental effort1\textendash 4, the structures of around 100,000 unique proteins have been determined5, but this represents a small fraction of the billions of known protein sequences6,7. Structural coverage is bottlenecked by the months to years of painstaking effort required to determine a single protein structure. Accurate computational approaches are needed to address this gap and to enable large-scale structural bioinformatics. Predicting the three-dimensional structure that a protein will adopt based solely on its amino acid sequence\textemdash the structure prediction component of the `protein folding problem'8\textemdash has been an important open research problem for more than 50~years9. Despite recent progress10\textendash 14, existing methods fall far~short of atomic accuracy, especially when no homologous structure is available. Here we provide the first computational method that can regularly predict protein structures with atomic accuracy even in cases in which no similar structure is known. We validated an entirely redesigned version of our neural network-based model, AlphaFold, in the challenging 14th Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction (CASP14)15, demonstrating accuracy competitive with experimental structures in a majority of cases and greatly outperforming other methods. Underpinning the latest version of AlphaFold is a novel machine learning approach that incorporates physical and biological knowledge about protein structure, leveraging multi-sequence alignments, into the design of the deep learning algorithm.},

However, the mechanism of ion selection by the anion channels is largely unknown. Here, we provide evidence that pore dilatation increases the bicarbonate permeability (P HC O3/ Cl ) of anion channels by reducing energy barriers of size-exclusion and ion dehydration of HCO3- permeation. Molecular, physiological and computational analyses of major anion channels, such as cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), anoctamin-1(ANO1/TMEM16A) and the glycine receptor (GlyR), revealed that the ion selectivity of anion channels is basically determined by the electric permittivity and diameter of the pore. Importantly, cellular stimuli dynamically modulate the anion selectivity of CFTR and ANO1 by changing the pore size. In addition, pore dilatation by a mutation in the pore-lining region alters the anion selectivity of GlyR. Changes in pore size affected not only the energy barriers of size exclusion but that of ion dehydration by altering the electric permittivity of water-filled cavity in the pore. The dynamic increase in P HC O3/ Cl by pore dilatation may have many physiological and pathophysiological implications ranging from epithelial HCO3- secretion to neuronal excitation.}

  abstract = {The growing interest in the complexity of biological interactions is continuously driving the need to increase system size in biophysical simulations, requiring not only powerful and advanced hardware but adaptable software that can accommodate a large number of atoms interacting through complex forcefields. To address this, we developed and implemented strategies in the GENESIS molecular dynamics package designed for large numbers of processors. Long-range electrostatic interactions were parallelized by minimizing the number of processes involved in communication. A novel algorithm was implemented for nonbonded interactions to increase single instruction multiple data (SIMD) performance, reducing memory usage for ultra large systems. Memory usage for neighbor searches in real-space nonbonded interactions was reduced by approximately 80\%, leading to significant speedup. Using experimental data describing physical 3D chromatin interactions, we constructed the first atomistic model of an entire gene locus (GATA4). Taken together, these developments enabled the first billion-atom simulation of an intact biomolecular complex, achieving scaling to 65,000 processes (130,000 processor cores) with 1 ns/day performance.

  abstract = {Efficient endocytosis of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is mediated by a tyrosine-based internalization signal in the CFTR carboxyl-terminal tail 1424YDSI1427. In the present studies, two naturally occurring cystic fibrosis mutations in the amino terminus of CFTR, R31C, and R31L were examined. To determine the defect that these mutations cause, the Arg-31 mutants were expressed in COS-7 cells and their biogenesis and trafficking to the cell surface tested in metabolic pulse-chase and surface biotinylation assays, respectively. The results indicated that both Arg-31 mutants were processed to band C at {$\sim$}50\% the efficiency of the wild-type protein. However, once processed and delivered to the cell surface, their half-lives were the same as wildtype protein. Interestingly, indirect immunofluorescence and cell surface biotinylation indicated that the surface pool was much smaller than could be accounted for based on the biogenesis defect alone. Therefore, the Arg-31 mutants were tested in internalization assays and found to be internalized at 2x the rate of the wild-type protein. Patch clamp and 6-methoxy-N-(3-sulfopropyl)quinolinium analysis confirmed reduced amounts of functional Arg-31 channels at the cell surface. Together, the results suggest that both R31C and R31L mutations compromise biogenesis and enhance internalization of CFTR. These two additive effects contribute to the loss of surface expression and the associated defect in chloride conductance that is consistent with a disease phenotype. \textcopyright{} 2006 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.},

In this review, recent developments in the constant electric- and mechanical-tension-induced rupture of giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) are considered. We summarize the results relating to the kinetics of GUV rupture as a function of membrane surface charge, ions in the bathing solution, lipid composition, cholesterol content in the membrane, and osmotic pressure. The mechanical stability and line tension of the membrane under these conditions are discussed. The membrane tension due to osmotic pressure and the critical tension of rupture for various membrane compositions are also discussed. The results and their analysis provide a biophysical description of the kinetics of rupture, along with insight into biological processes. Future directions and possible developments in this research area are included.},

However, predicted loss-of-function variants are enriched for annotation errors, and tend to be found at extremely low frequencies, so their analysis requires careful variant annotation and very large sample sizes1. Here we describe the aggregation of 125,748 exomes and 15,708 genomes from human sequencing studies into the Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD). We identify 443,769 high-confidence predicted loss-of-function variants in this cohort after filtering for artefacts caused by sequencing and annotation errors. Using an improved model of human mutation rates, we classify human protein-coding genes along a spectrum that represents tolerance to inactivation, validate this classification using data from model organisms and engineered human cells, and show that it can be used to improve the power of gene discovery for both common and rare diseases.},

  abstract = {In this article, we report a molecular dynamics simulation study on the X-ray and neutron scattering structures of deep eutectic solvents (DESs) and show that the DESs studied possess unique spatial heterogeneity on molecular length scales. The simulated X-ray and neutron scattering structure functions (S(q)s) of the DESs made of alkylamide + Li+/ClO4- display two peaks in the intermolecular region of the S(q)s. As a signature of nanoscale structural organization/heterogeneity, a prepeak is observed at 0.1 {$<$} q/\AA -1 {$<$} 0.4. The principal peak observed at around 1.2 {$<$} q/\AA -1 {$<$} 2 is rendered by short-distance inter- and intraspecies correlations. For the DESs studied, we demonstrate that nanoscale spatial heterogeneity is exhibited profoundly by the segregated domains of the constituent electrolyte, and the principal peak in S(q) is because of all sorts of close-contact correlations. The extent of nanoscale morphology as well as the strength of ion pairing is enhanced for the longer-tail alkylamide DES.}

  abstract = {Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common autosomal recessive disorder in Caucasian populations. Individuals with CF have seen significant increases in life expectancy in the last 60 years. As a result, previously rare complications are now coming to light. The most common of these is cystic fibrosis-related diabetes (CFRD), which affects 40-50\% of CF adults. CFRD significantly impacts the pulmonary function and longevity of CF patients, yet a lack of consensus on the best methods to diagnose and treat CFRD remains. We begin by reviewing our understanding of the pathogenesis of CFRD, as emerging evidence shows the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) also has important roles in the release of insulin and glucagon and in the protection of {$\beta$} cells from oxidative stress. We then discuss how current recommended methods of CFRD diagnosis are not appropriate, as continuous glucose monitoring becomes more effective, practical, and cost-effective. Finally, we evaluate emerging treatments which have narrowed the mortality gap within the CF patient group. In the future, pharmacological potentiators and correctors directly targeting CFTR show huge promise for both CFRD and the wider CF patient groups.},

  abstract = {Energy migration between tryptophan residues has been experimentally demonstrated in self-assembled peptide tapes. Each peptide contains 11 amino acids with a Trp at position 6. The peptide self-assembly is pH-sensitive and forms amphiphilic tapes, which further stack in ribbons (double tapes) and fibrils in water depending on the concentration. Fluorescence spectra, quenching, and anisotropy experiments showed that when the pH is lowered from 9 to 2, the peptide self-assembly buries the tryptophan in a hydrophobic and restricted environment in the interior of stable ribbons as expected on the basis of the peptide design. These fluorescence data support directly and for the first time the presence of such ribbons which are characterized by a highly packed and stable hydrophobic interior. In common with Trp in many proteins, fluorescence lifetimes are nonexponential, but the average lifetime is shorter at low pH, possibly due to quenching with neighboring Phe residues. Unexpectedly, time-resolved fluorescence anisotropy does not change significantly with self-assembly when in water. In highly viscous sucrose-water mixtures, the anisotropy decay at low pH was largely unchanged compared to that in water, whereas at high pH, the anisotropy decay increased significantly. We concluded that depolarization at low pH was not due to rotational diffusion but mainly due to energy migration between adjacent tryptophan residues. This was supported by a master equation kinetic model of Trp-Trp energy migration, which showed that the simulated and experimental results are in good agreement, although on average only three Trp residues were visited before emission.},

In particular, the number of water molecules required to fully surround each anion has been investigated. Monte Carlo calculations have been used in an attempt to find the solvated system X -(H 2O) n (X = F, Cl) with the lowest energy for each value of n. It is predicted that 18 water molecules are required to form a complete solvation shell around a Cl - anion, where "complete solvation" is interpreted as an ion that is completely surrounded by solvent molecules. Although fewer water molecules may fully solvate the Cl - anion, such structures are higher in energy than partially solvated molecules, up to n {$\geq$} 18. Calculations on the F - anion suggest that 15 water molecules are required for a complete solvation shell. The EFP predictions are in good agreement with the relative energies predicted by ab initio energy calculations at the EFP geometries. \textcopyright{} 2005 American Chemical Society.}

Methods: We measured effects of CFTR modulators on CFTR-dependent sweating (`C-sweat') in two pancreatic sufficient cystic fibrosis (CF) subjects. S1 (S945L/G542X) took ivacaftor and S2 (S945L/F508del) took ivacaftor + tezacaftor. Sweating was stimulated pharmacologically to produce sequentially both CFTR-independent (methacholine stimulated) M-sweat and C-sweat; and the ratio of these was compared. Sweat secretion was measured with two methods: real time secretory rate quantitative recording and by optically measuring the growth of sweat bubbles under oil from multiple identified glands. Results: Using the quantitative recorder, we saw zero C-sweat secretion off-drug, but when on-drug the C-sweat responses for both subjects were comparable to those seen in carriers. The on-drug response was further quantified using the sweat bubble method. Each subject again showed robust C-sweat responses, with C-sweat/M-sweat ratios \textasciitilde{} half of the ratio determined for a cohort of 40 controls tested under identical conditions. Conclusion: These in vivo results, consistent with prior in vitro findings, indicate that the drug treatments restore near-normal function to S945L-CFTR, and support the use of ivacaftor as a treatment for CF patients who carry this allele.},

Dynamically regulated ion channel activity and anion selectivity of CFTR by kinases sensitive to intracellular chloride concentration ([Cl-]i) play an important role in epithelial HCO3- secretion. However, the molecular mechanisms of how [Cl-]i-dependent mechanisms regulate CFTR are unknown. Methods We examined the mechanisms of the CFTR HCO3- channel regulation by [Cl-]i-sensitive kinases using an integrated electrophysiological, molecular, and computational approach including whole-cell, outside-out, and inside-out patch clamp recordings and molecular dissection of WNK1 and CFTR proteins. In addition, we analyzed the effects of pancreatitis-causing CFTR mutations on the WNK1-mediated regulation of CFTR. Results Among the WNK1, SPAK, and OSR1 kinases that constitute a [Cl-]i-sensitive kinase cascade, the expression of WNK1 alone was sufficient to increase the CFTR bicarbonate permeability (PHCO3/PCl) and conductance (GHCO3) in patch clamp recordings. Molecular dissection of the WNK1 domains revealed that the WNK1 kinase domain is responsible for CFTR PHCO3/PCl regulation by direct association with CFTR, while the surrounding N-terminal regions mediate the [Cl-]i-sensitivity of WNK1. Furthermore, the pancreatitis-causing R74Q and R75Q mutations in the elbow helix 1 of CFTR hampered WNK1-CFTR physical associations and reduced WNK1-mediated CFTR PHCO3/PCl regulation. Conclusion The CFTR HCO3- channel activity is regulated by [Cl-]i and a WNK1-dependent mechanism. Our results provide new insights into the regulation of the ion selectivity of CFTR and the pathogenesis of CFTR-related disorders.},

This is not yet the case for solution spectra. To contribute to the exploration of corresponding computational procedures, here we suggest a more efficient variant of the so-called instantaneous normal-mode analysis (INMA). This variant applies conventional molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, which are based on nonpolarizable molecular mechanics (MM) force fields, to the rapid generation of a large ensemble of different solvation shells for a solute molecule. Short hybrid simulations, in which the solute is treated by DFT and the aqueous solvent by MM, start from snapshots of the MM solute-solvent MD trajectory and yield a set of statistically independent hydration shells partially adjusted to the DFT/MM force field. Within INMA, these shells are kept fixed at their 300 K structures, line spectra are calculated from the DFT/MM Hessians of the solute, and its inhomogeneously broadened solution spectra are derived by second-order statistics. As our test application we have selected the phosphate ions HPO42- and H2PO4 because sizable solvation effects are expected for the IR spectra of these strongly polarizable ions. The widths, intensities, and spectral positions of the calculated bands are compared with experimental IR spectra recorded by us for the purpose of checking the computational procedures. These comparisons provide insights into the merits and limitations of the available DFT/MM approach to the prediction of IR spectra in the condensed phase.}

We propose an explanation, based on molecular simulations, how ions determine the miscibility of ILs and suggest a straightforward and computationally inexpensive method to predict the miscibility of arbitrary new ILs. The influence of ions on the solvation of water is analyzed by comparing molecular dynamics simulations of water in 9 different ILs with varying cation and anion constituents. The solvation of water in ILs is found to depend primarily on the electrostatic water-ion interaction strength, which, in turn, is determined mainly by two factors: primarily, by the size of the ions and secondarily by the amount of charge on the ion surface that is coordinated with water. It is demonstrated that large ions lead to weaker interactions with water, due to the involved delocalization of the ion charge. A large charge on the ion surface, which is determined by the chemical structure of the ion, strengthens water-ion interactions. We observe that whenever the interaction strength of water with ions exceeds a certain threshold, an IL becomes water-miscible. On the basis of these findings, a simple equation is derived that estimates the water-ion interaction strength. With this equation it is possible to predict most of the observed water-miscibilities of a sample of 83 ILs correctly. A linear increase of the water saturation concentration with the estimated water-ion interaction strength is observed in waterimmiscible ILs, which can be utilized to predict the water concentration in new ILs. \textcopyright{} 2010 American Chemical Society.}

However, the hybrid method PME/IPS [Particle Mesh Ewald for electrostatics and 3D IPS for Lennard-Jones (LJ) interactions] provides an efficient way to include both types of long-range forces in simulations of large liquid/vacuum and all liquid/liquid interfaces, including lipid monolayers and bilayers. A previously published pressure-based long-range LJ correction yields results similar to those of PME/IPS for liquid/liquid interfaces. The contributions to surface tension of LJ terms arising from interactions beyond 10 \AA{} range from 13 dyn/cm for the hexadecane/vapor interface to approximately 3 dyn/cm for hexadecane/water and DPPC bilayers and monolayers. Surface tensions of alkane/vapor, hexadecane/water, and DPPC monolayers based on the CHARMM lipid force fields agree very well with experiment, whereas surface tensions of the TIP3P and TIP4P-Ew water models underestimate experiment by 16 and 11 dyn/cm, respectively. Dipole potential drops ({$\Delta\Psi$}) are less sensitive to long-range LJ interactions than surface tensions. However, {$\Delta\Psi$} for the DPPC bilayer (845 {$\pm$} 3 mV proceeding from water to lipid) and water (547 {$\pm$} 2 mV for TIP4P-Ew and 521 {$\pm$} 3 mV for TIP3P) overestimate experiment by factors of 3 and 5, respectively, and represent expected deficiencies in nonpolarizable force fields.},

  abstract = {Molecular simulations are a computational technique used to investigate the dynamics of proteins and other molecules. The free energy landscape of these simulations is often rugged, and minor differences in the initial velocities, floating-point precision, or underlying hardware can cause identical simulations (replicas) to take different paths in the landscape. In this study we investigated the magnitude of these effects based on 310\,000 ns of simulation time. We performed 100 identically parametrized replicas of 3000 ns each for a small 10 amino acid system as well as 100 identically parametrized replicas of 100 ns each for an 827 residue T-cell receptor/MHC system. Comparing randomly chosen subgroups within these replica sets, we estimated the reproducibility and reliability that can be achieved by a given number of replicas at a given simulation time. These results demonstrate that conclusions drawn from single simulations are often not reproducible and that conclusions drawn from multiple shorter replicas are more reliable than those from a single longer simulation. The actual number of replicas needed will always depend on the question asked and the level of reliability sought. On the basis of our data, it appears that a good rule of thumb is to perform a minimum of five to 10 replicas.},

  abstract = {Studies have shown that expression of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is associated with enhanced glutathione (GSH) efflux from airway epithelial cells, implicating a role for CFTR in the control of oxidative stress in the airways. To define the mechanism underlying CFTR-associated GSH flux, we studied wild-type and mutant CFTR proteins expressed in Sf9 membranes, as well as purified and reconstituted CFTR. We show that CFTR-expressing membrane vesicles mediate nucleotide-activated GSH flux, which is disrupted in the R347D pore mutant, and in the Walker A K464A and K1250A mutants. Further, we reveal that purified CFTR protein alone directly mediates nucleotide-dependent GSH flux. Interestingly, although ATP supports GSH flux through CFTR, this activity is enhanced in the presence of the non-hydrolyzable ATP analog AMP-PNP. These findings corroborate previous suggestions that CFTR pore properties can vary with the nature of the nucleotide interaction. In conclusion, our data demonstrate that GSH flux is an intrinsic function of CFTR and prompt future examination of the role of this function in airway biology in health and disease.},

This technique measures the number density, diffusion coefficient, and velocity of fluorescently labeled macromolecules in a cell membrane imaged on a confocal, two-photon, or total internal reflection fluorescence microscope. In contrast to r-space correlation techniques, we show kICS can recover accurate dynamics even in the presence of complex fluorophore photobleaching and/or "blinking". Furthermore, these quantities can be calculated without nonlinear curve fitting, or any knowledge of the beam radius of the exciting laser. The number densities calculated by kICS are less sensitive to spatial inhomogeneity of the fluorophore distribution than densities measured using image correlation spectroscopy. We use simulations as a proof-of-principle to show that number densities and transport coefficients can be extracted using this technique. We present calibration measurements with fluorescent microspheres imaged on a confocal microscope, which recover Stokes-Einstein diffusion coefficients, and flow velocities that agree with single particle tracking measurements. We also show the application of kICS to measurements of the transport dynamics of {$\alpha$}5-integrin/enhanced green fluorescent protein constructs in a transfected CHO cell imaged on a total internal reflection fluorescence microscope using charge-coupled device area detection. \textcopyright{} 2006 by the Biophysical Society.}

It is a key component of bacterial cell wall peptidoglycan, fungal cell wall chitin, and the extracellular matrix of animal cells. Interestingly, recent studies have also identified new roles for GlcNAc in cell signaling. For example, GlcNAc stimulates the human fungal pathogen Candida albicans to undergo changes in morphogenesis and expression of virulence genes. Pathogenic E. coli responds to GlcNAc by altering the expression of fimbriae and CURLI fibers that promote biofilm formation and GlcNAc stimulates soil bacteria to undergo changes in morphogenesis and production of antibiotics. Studies with animal cells have revealed that GlcNAc influences cell signaling through the posttranslational modification of proteins by glycosylation. O-linked attachment of GlcNAc to Ser and Thr residues regulates a variety of intracellular proteins, including transcription factors such as NF {$\kappa$} B, c-myc, and p53. In addition, the specificity of Notch family receptors for different ligands is altered by GlcNAc attachment to fucose residues in the extracellular domain. GlcNAc also impacts signal transduction by altering the degree of branching of N-linked glycans, which influences cell surface signaling proteins. These emerging roles of GlcNAc as an activator and mediator of cellular signaling in fungi, animals, and bacteria will be the focus of this paper.}

Five arguments in sup- port of greater international cooperation and more formal processes of global governance on international migration are presented here. First, contemporary international migration is now occurring at unprecedented levels and has a truly global reach. Second, international migration can no longer effectively bemanaged or controlled by nationalmigration policies, and greater international cooperation is required to achieve national goals in international migration. Third, there are growing numbers of migrants around the world who are vulnerable and exploited, and insufficiently pro- tected by either states or international institutions. Fourth, emerging struc- tural features in the global economy, alongside the effects of climate change, are likely to significantly increase the scale of internationalmigrationworld- wide, and present new management and protection challenges. Finally, mo- mentumfor change is slowly developing. KEYWORDS: internationalmigration, global governance.},

  abstract = {We have developed a simple and quantitative explanation for the relatively low melting temperatures of ionic liquids (ILs). The basic concept was to assess the Gibbs free energy of fusion ({$\Delta$}fusG) for the process IL(S) \textrightarrow{} IL(l), which relates to the melting point of the IL. This was done using a suitable Born-Fajans-Haber cycle that was closed by the lattice (i.e., IL(S) \textrightarrow{} IL(g)) Gibbs energy and the solvation (i.e., IL(g) \textrightarrow{} IL(l)) Gibbs energies of the constituent ions in the molten salt. As part of this project we synthesized and determined accurate melting points (by DSC) and dielectric constants (by dielectric spectroscopy) for 14 ionic liquids based on four common anions and nine common cations. Lattice free energies ({$\Delta$}lattG) were estimated using a combination of Volume Based Thermodynamics (VBT) and quantum chemical calculations. Free energies of solvation ({$\Delta$} SOlVG) of each ion in the bulk molten salt were calculated using the COSMO solvation model and the experimental dielectric constants. Under standard ambient conditions (298.15 K and 10s Pa) {$\Delta$}fusG\textdegree{} was found to be negative for all the ILs studied, as expected for liquid samples. Thus, these ILs are liquid under standard ambient conditions because the liquid state is thermodynamically favorable, due to the large size and conformational flexibility of the ions involved, which leads to small lattice enthalpies and large entropy changes that favor melting. This model can be used to predict the melting temperatures and dielectric constants of ILs with good accuracy. A comparison of the predicted vs experimental melting points for nine of the ILs (excluding those where no melting transition was observed and two outliers that were not well described by the model) gave a standard error of the estimate (sest) of 8 \textdegree C. A similar comparison for dielectric constant predictions gave sest as 2.5 units. Thus, from very little experimental and computational data it is possible to predict fundamental properties such as melting points and dielectric constants of ionic liquids. \textcopyright{} 2006 American Chemical Society.}

  abstract = {Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disorder that causes multiorgan morbidity and premature death, most commonly from pulmonary dysfunction. Mutations in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene, of which almost 2000 have been described, result in a dysfunctional CFTR protein. This protein is an adenosine triphosphate binding anion channel, present primarily at the surface of epithelial cells. Loss of function mutations in this anion channel result in decreased or absent chloride/bicarbonate transport. The subsequent abnormal salt and water transport at epithelial cell surfaces leads to thickened secretions, and infection or inflammation in affected organs. In the last 20 years, therapeutics have been developed to treat the signs and symptoms of CF. However, in 2012, the small molecule drug, ivacaftor, became the first approved therapy that addresses the basic defect in CF. Ivacaftor is a potentiator of CFTR channels defective in their chloride/bicarbonate gating/conductance, but present at the epithelial cell surface. It is only approved for 10 mutations carried by approximately 7\% of the population of patients with CF. F508del is the most common CFTR mutation, present in homozygosity in approximately 50\% of patients with CF. The F508del mutation results in multiple CFTR channel defects that require both correction (stabilization of misfolded CFTR and trafficking to the epithelial cell membrane) and potentiation. This article reviews the in vitro and clinical trial data for the potential use of the potentiator, ivacaftor, and the corrector, lumacaftor, in patients with CF. \textcopyright{} 2015, SAGE Publications.

  abstract = {A straightforward method that accounts for the long-range Lennard-Jones (LJ) terms in constant pressure molecular dynamics simulations is presented. This long-range correction (LRC) consists of an additional applied pressure tensor which is periodically calculated from the difference of instantaneous pressures at the selected cutoff and a very long cutoff. It provides results that are nearly independent of the LJ cutoff distance at negligible additional calculation costs, and is particularly suited for anisotropic systems such as liquid/liquid interfaces or heterogeneous macromolecules where approximations based on spherically symmetric radial distribution functions are expected to fail. The utility of the method is demonstrated for a series of alkanes and water, and for interfaces including a lipid bilayer. The LRC increases densities and decreases isothermal compressibilities, with the changes larger for alkanes than for water (where the long-range interactions are dominated by electrostatic interactions). While implementation of the LRC will not necessarily improve agreement with a particular experiment, it will provide a baseline for improvements in a parameter set that are consistent with the long-range Lennard-Jones interactions.},

In the algorithm the normal evolution of the system is biased by a history-dependent potential constructed as a sum of Gaussians centered along the trajectory followed by a suitably chosen set of collective variables. The sum of Gaussians is exploited for reconstructing iteratively an estimator of the free energy and forcing the system to escape from local minima. This review is intended to provide a comprehensive description of the algorithm, with a focus on the practical aspects that need to be addressed when one attempts to apply metadynamics to a new system: (i) the choice of the appropriate set of collective variables; (ii) the optimal choice of the metadynamics parameters and (iii) how to control the error and ensure convergence of the algorithm. \textcopyright{} 2008 IOP Publishing Ltd.}

Due to the large system sizes and long timescales involved, such a pursuit was for many years computationally intractable. Further, sufficiently accurate forcefields needed to be developed in order to realistically model folding. This decade, however, saw the first reports of folding simulations describing kinetics on the order of milliseconds, placing many proteins firmly within reach of these methods. Progress in sampling and forcefield accuracy, however, presents a new challenge: how to turn huge MD datasets into scientific understanding. Here, we review recent progress in MD simulation techniques and show how the vast datasets generated by such techniques present new challenges for analysis. We critically discuss the state of the art, including reaction coordinate and Markov state model (MSM) methods, and provide a perspective for the future.},

  abstract = {The calcium-activated chloride channel (CaCC) TMEM16A plays crucial roles in regulating neuronal excitability, smooth muscle contraction, fluid secretion and gut motility. While opening of TMEM16A requires binding of intracellular Ca2+, prolonged Ca2+-dependent activation results in channel desensitization or rundown, the mechanism of which is unclear. Here we show that phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate (PIP2) regulates TMEM16A channel activation and desensitization via binding to a putative binding site at the cytosolic interface of transmembrane segments (TMs) 3\textendash 5. We further demonstrate that the ion-conducting pore of TMEM16A is constituted of two functionally distinct modules: a Ca2+-binding module formed by TMs 6\textendash 8 and a PIP2-binding regulatory module formed by TMs 3\textendash 5, which mediate channel activation and desensitization, respectively. PIP2 dissociation from the regulatory module results in ion-conducting pore collapse and subsequent channel desensitization. Our findings thus provide key insights into the mechanistic understanding of TMEM16 channel gating and lipid-dependent regulation.},

Yet, few psychological treatments for this debilitating disorder have been studied. One intervention which involves the parents of the adolescent has proved to be promising, especially in patients with a short duration of illness, i.e., less than three years. The benefits of this family-based treatment have also been shown to be enduring at five-year follow-up. All available studies of psychological treatments for adolescent AN, both controlled trials and case series, are reviewed here. Almost all of them involve parents in treatment. These studies show that the majority of patients, even those who are severely ill, can be treated quite successfully as outpatients provided that the parents participate in treatment. In this family-based treatment, parents are viewed as a resource rather than a hindrance. Optimism regarding these encouraging findings should be tempered until larger scale randomized trials have been conducted.},

  abstract = {Molecular dynamics simulations are being applied to increasingly complex systems, including those involving small endogenous compounds and drug molecules. In order to obtain meaningful and accurate data from these simulations, high-quality topologies for small molecules must be generated in a manner that is consistent with the derivation of the force field applied to the system. Often, force fields are designed for use with macromolecules such as proteins, making their transferability to other species challenging. Investigators are increasingly attracted to automated topology generation programs, although the quality of the resulting topologies remains unknown. Here we assess the applicability of the popular PRODRG server that generates small-molecule topologies for use with the GROMOS family of force fields. We find that PRODRG does not reproduce topologies for even the most well-characterized species in the force field due to inconsistent charges and charge groups. We assessed the effects of PRODRG-derived charges on several systems: pure liquids, amino acids at a hydrophobic-hydrophilic interface, and an enzyme-cofactor complex. We found that partial atomic charges generated by PRODRG are largely incompatible with GROMOS force fields, and the behavior of these systems deviates substantially from that of simulations using GROMOS parameters. We conclude by proposing several points as "best practices" for parametrization of small molecules under the GROMOS force fields. \textcopyright{} 2010 American Chemical Society.}

  abstract = {Protein force fields have been undergoing continual development since the first complete parameter sets were introduced nearly four decades ago. The functional forms that underlie these models have many common elements for the treatment of bonded and nonbonded forces, which are reviewed here. The most widely used force fields to date use a fixed-charge convention in which electronic polarization effects are treated via a mean-field approximation during partial charge assignment. Despite success in modeling folded proteins over many years, the fixed-charge assumption has limitations that cannot necessarily be overcome within their potential energy equations. To overcome these limitations, several force fields have recently been derived that explicitly treat electronic polarization effects with straightforward extensions of the potential energy functions used by nonpolarizable force fields. Here, we review the history of the most popular nonpolarizable force fields (AMBER, CHARMM, OPLS, and GROMOS) as well as studies that have validated them and applied them to studies of protein folding and misfolding. Building upon these force fields are more recent polarizable interaction potentials, including fluctuating charge models, POSSIM, AMOEBA, and the classical Drude oscillator. These force fields differ in their implementations but all attempt to model electronic polarization in a computationally tractable manner. Despite their recent emergence in the field of protein folding, several studies have already applied these polarizable models to challenging problems in this domain, including the role of polarization in folding free energies and sequence-specific effects on the stability of {$\alpha$}-helical structures.},

The familiar problem is the Euthyphro dilemma: if God wills something because it is good, then goodness is independent of God, so God becomes, morally speaking, de trop. On the other hand, if something is good because God wills it, then, given the absence of constraint on what God may will, moral truths are \textendash{} counterintuitively \textendash{} contingent. An examination of the kinds of necessity and possibility at work in this conundrum leads us to the most promising solution: there is a metaphysical connection between God and goodness. What he wills is an expression of his nature. But (and this is the unfamiliar angle), that solution now poses an acute problem for an understanding of the Incarnation. For if God is constitutive of goodness, and Christ is God incar- nate, then Christ is constitutive of goodness. But Christ, as a human, is subject to external moral evaluation and obligation, which entails that he is not constitutive of goodness. This meta- ethical difficulty is not easily met by the usual strategies by which Christ is understood to have two natures. Reflection on our moral relations to our past selves, however, suggests a way forward.}

  abstract = {The {$\Delta$}F508 mutation in nucleotide-binding domain 1 (NBD1) of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is the predominant cause of cystic fibrosis. Previous biophysical studies on human F508 and {$\Delta$}F508 domains showed only local structural changes restricted to residues 509-511 and only minor differences in folding rate and stability. These results were remarkable because {$\Delta$}F508 was widely assumed to perturb domain folding based on the fact that it prevents trafficking of CFTR out of the endoplasmic reticulum. However, the previously reported crystal structures did not come from matched F508 and {$\Delta$}F508 constructs, and the {$\Delta$}F508 structure contained additional mutations that were required to obtain sufficient protein solubility. In this article, we present additional biophysical studies of NBD1 designed to address these ambiguities. Mass spectral measurements of backbone amide 1H/2H exchange rates in matched F508 and {$\Delta$}F508 constructs reveal that {$\Delta$}F508 increases backbone dynamics at residues 509-511 and the adjacent protein segments but not elsewhere in NBD1. These measurements also confirm a high level of flexibility in the protein segments exhibiting variable conformations in the crystal structures. We additionally present crystal structures of a broader set of human NBD1 constructs, including one harboring the native F508 residue and others harboring the {$\Delta$}F508 mutation in the presence of fewer and different solubilizing mutations. The only consistent conformational difference is observed at residues 509-511. The side chain of residue V510 in this loop is mostly buried in all non-{$\Delta$}F508 structures but completely solvent exposed in all {$\Delta$}F508 structures. These results reinforce the importance of the perturbation {$\Delta$}F508 causes in the surface topography of NBD1 in a region likely to mediate contact with the transmembrane domains of CFTR. However, they also suggest that increased exposure of the 509-511 loop and increased dynamics in its vicinity could promote aggregation in vitro and aberrant intermolecular interactions that impede trafficking in vivo. \textcopyright{} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract = {The nature of the interaction between deep eutectic solvents (DESs), formed by ChCl and glycerol, and SO2 has been systematically investigated using the M06-2X density functional combined with cluster models. Block-localized wave function energy decomposition (BLW-ED) analysis shows that the interaction between SO2 and DESs is dominated by a charge transfer interaction. After this interaction, the SO2 molecule becomes negatively charged, whereas the ChCl-glycerol molecule is positively charged, which is the result of Lewis acid-base interaction. The current result affords a theoretical proof that it is highly useful and efficient to manipulate the Lewis acidity of absorbents for SO2 capture. Moreover, hydrogen bonding as well as electrostatic interactions may also contribute to the stability of the complex. Structure analysis shows that solvent molecules will adjust their geometries to interact with SO2. In addition, the structure of SO2 is barely changed after interaction. The interaction energy between different cluster models and SO2 ranges from -6.8 to -14.4 kcal mol-1. It is found that the interaction energy is very sensitive to the solvent structure. The moderate interaction between ChCl-glycerol and SO2 is consistent with the concept that highly efficient solvents for SO2 absorption should not only be solvable but also regenerable. 0}

  abstract = {Additive force fields are designed to account for induced electronic polarization in a mean-field average way, using effective empirical fixed charges. The limitation of this approximation is cause for serious concerns, particularly in the case of lipid membranes, where the molecular environment undergoes dramatic variations over microscopic length scales. A polarizable force field based on the classical Drude oscillator offers a practical and computationally efficient framework for an improved representation of electrostatic interactions in molecular simulations. Building on the first-generation Drude polarizable force field for the dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPPC) molecule, the present effort was undertaken to improve this initial model and expand the force field to a wider range of phospholipid molecules. New lipids parametrized include dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC), dilauroylphosphatidylcholine (DLPC), 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC), 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC), dipalmitoylphosphatidylethanolamine (DPPE), 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (POPE), and 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DOPE). The iterative optimization protocol employed in this effort led to lipid models that achieve a good balance between reproducing quantum mechanical data on model compound representative of phospholipids and reproducing a range of experimental condensed phase properties of bilayers. A parametrization strategy based on a restrained ensemble\textendash maximum entropy methodology was used to help accurately match the experimental NMR order parameters in the polar headgroup region. All the parameters were developed to be compatible with the remainder of the Drude polarizable force field, which includes water, ions, proteins, DNA, and selected carbohydrates.},

We investigate the formation of a heterodimer protein complex between the SAM domains of the EphA2 receptor and the SHIP2 enzyme by performing a combined total of 48 {$\mu$}s simulations with the different potential functions. While the native SAM heterodimer is only predicted at a low rate of 6.7\% with the original CHARMM36 force field, the yield is increased to 16.7\% with CHARMM36s, and to 18.3\% with CHARMM36m. By analyzing the 25 native SAM complexes formed in the simulations, we find that their formation involves a preorientation guided by Coulomb interactions, consistent with an electrostatic steering mechanism. In 12 cases, the complex could directly transform to the native protein interaction surfaces with only small adjustments in domain orientation. In the other 13 cases, orientational and/or translational adjustments are needed to reach the native complex. Although the tendency for non-native complexes to dissociate has nearly doubled with the modified potential functions, a dissociation followed by a reassociation to the correct complex structure is still rare. Instead, the remaining non-native complexes undergo configurational changes/surface searching, which, however, rarely leads to native structures on a time scale of 250 ns.

  abstract = {The CHARMM Drude-2013 polarizable force field (FF) was developed to include the explicit treatment of induced electronic polarizability, resulting in a more accurate description of the electrostatic interactions in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. While the Drude-2013 protein FF has shown success in improving the folding properties of {$\alpha$}-helical peptides and to reproduce experimental observables in simulations up to 1 {$\mu$}s, some limitations were noted regarding the stability of {$\beta$}-sheet structures in simulations longer than 100 ns as well as larger deviations from crystal structures in simulations of a number of proteins compared to the additive CHARMM36 protein FF. The origin of the instability has been identified and appears to be primarily due to overestimated atomic polarizabilities and induced dipole-dipole interactions on the C{$\beta$}, C{$\gamma$} and C{$\delta$} side chain atoms. To resolve this and other issues, a number of aspects of the model were re-visited, resulting in Drude-2019 protein FF. Backbone parameters were optimized targeting the conformational properties of the (Ala)5 peptide in solution along with gas phase properties of the alanine dipeptide. Dipeptides that contain N-acetylated and N'-methylamidated termini, excluding Gly, Pro and Ala, were used as models to optimize the atomic polarizabilities and Thole screening factors on selected C{$\beta$}, C{$\gamma$} and C{$\delta$} carbons by targeting quantum mechanical (QM) dipole moments and molecular polarizabilities. In addition, to obtain better conformational properties, side chain {$\chi$}1 and {$\chi$}2 dihedral parameters were optimized targeting QM data for the respective side chain dipeptide conformations as well as PDB survey data based on the {$\chi$}1, {$\chi$}2 sampling from Hamiltonian replica-exchange MD simulations of (Ala)4-X-(Ala)4 in solution, where X is the amino acid of interest. Further improvements include optimizing nonbonded interactions between charged residues to reproduce QM interactions energies of the charged-protein model compounds and experimental osmotic pressures. Validation of the optimized Drude protein FF includes MD simulations of a collection of peptides and proteins including {$\beta$}-sheet structures, as well as transmembrane ion channels. Results showed that the updated Drude-2019 protein FF yields smaller overall RMS differences of proteins as compared to the additive CHARMM36m and Drude-2013 FFs as well as similar or improved agreement with experimental NMR properties, allowing for long timescale simulation studies of proteins and more complex biomolecular systems in conjunction with the remainder of the Drude polarizable FF.,},

Here, we report the results of atomic-level molecular dynamics simulations, over periods ranging between 100 {$\mu$}s and 1 ms, that reveal a set of common principles underlying the folding of 12 structurally diverse proteins. In simulations conducted with a single physics-based energy function, the proteins, representing all three major structural classes, spontaneously and repeatedly fold to their experimentally determined native structures. Early in the folding process, the protein backbone adopts a nativelike topology while certain secondary structure elements and a small number of nonlocal contacts form. In most cases, folding follows a single dominant route in which elements of the native structure appear in an order highly correlated with their propensity to form in the unfolded state.}

  abstract = {Human ubiquitin has been extensively characterized using a variety of experimental and computational methods and has become an important model for studying protein dynamics. Nevertheless, it has proven difficult to characterize the microsecond time scale dynamics of this protein with atomistic resolution. Here we use an unbiased computer simulation to describe the structural dynamics of ubiquitin on the picosecond to millisecond time scale. In the simulation, ubiquitin interconverts between a small number of distinct states on the microsecond to millisecond time scale. We find that the conformations visited by free ubiquitin in solution are very similar to those found various crystal structures of ubiquitin in complex with other proteins, a finding in line with previous experimental studies. We also observe weak but statistically significant correlated motions throughout the protein, including long-range concerted movement across the entire {$\beta$} sheet, consistent with recent experimental observations. We expect that the detailed atomistic description of ubiquitin dynamics provided by this unbiased simulation may be useful in interpreting current and future experiments on this protein.},

  abstract = {An outstanding challenge in the field of molecular biology has been to understand the process by which proteins fold into their characteristic three-dimensional structures. Here, we report the results of atomic-level molecular dynamics simulations, over periods ranging between 100 {$\mu$}s and 1 ms, that reveal a set of common principles underlying the folding of 12 structurally diverse proteins. In simulations conducted with a single physics-based energy function, the proteins, representing all three major structural classes, spontaneously and repeatedly fold to their experimentally determined native structures. Early in the folding process, the protein backbone adopts a nativelike topology while certain secondary structure elements and a small number of nonlocal contacts form. In most cases, folding follows a single dominant route in which elements of the native structure appear in an order highly correlated with their propensity to form in the unfolded state.}

  abstract = {Platonism about mathematics (or mathematical platonism) isthe metaphysical view that there are abstract mathematical objectswhose existence is independent of us and our language, thought, andpractices. Just as electrons and planets exist independently of us, sodo numbers and sets. And just as statements about electrons and planetsare made true or false by the objects with which they are concerned andthese objects' perfectly objective properties, so are statements aboutnumbers and sets. Mathematical truths are therefore discovered, notinvented., The most important argument for the existence of abstractmathematical objects derives from Gottlob Frege and goes as follows(Frege 1953). The language of mathematics purports to refer to andquantify over abstract mathematical objects. And a great number ofmathematical theorems are true. But a sentence cannot be true unlessits sub-expressions succeed in doing what they purport to do. So thereexist abstract mathematical objects that these expressions refer to andquantify over., Frege's argument notwithstanding, philosophers have developed avariety of objections to mathematical platonism. Thus, abstractmathematical objects are claimed to be epistemologically inaccessibleand metaphysically problematic. Mathematical platonism has been amongthe most hotly debated topics in the philosophy of mathematics over thepast few decades.},

This review summarizes our current understanding of the architecture of the channel pore, as defined by electrophysiological analysis and molecular modeling studies. This includes consideration of the characteristic functional properties of the pore, definition of the overall shape of the entire extent of the pore, and discussion of how the molecular structure of distinct regions of the pore might control different facets of pore function. Comparisons are drawn with closely related proteins that are not ion channels, and also with structurally unrelated proteins with anion channel function.

  abstract = {Many biological processes are based on molecular recognition between highly charged molecules such as nucleic acids, inorganic ions, charged amino acids, etc. For such cases, it has been demonstrated that molecular simulations with fixed partial charges often fail to achieve experimental accuracy. Although incorporation of more advanced electrostatic models (such as multipoles, mutual polarization, etc.) can significantly improve simulation accuracy, it increases computational expense by a factor of 5-20\texttimes. Indirect free energy (IFE) methods can mitigate this cost by modeling intermediate states at fixed-charge resolution. For example, an efficient "reference" model such as a pairwise Amber, CHARMM, or OPLS-AA force field can be used to derive an initial estimate, followed by thermodynamic corrections to a more advanced "target" potential such as the polarizable AMOEBA model. Unfortunately, all currently described IFE methods encounter difficulties reweighting more than {$\sim$}50 atoms between resolutions due to extensive scaling of both the magnitude of the thermodynamic corrections and their statistical uncertainty. We present an approach called "simultaneous bookending" (SB) that is fundamentally different from existing IFE methods based on a tunable sampling approximation, which permits scaling to thousands of atoms. SB is demonstrated on the relative binding affinity of Mg2+/Ca2+ to a set of metalloproteins with up to 2972 atoms, finding no statistically significant difference between direct AMOEBA results and those from correcting Amber to AMOEBA. The ability to change the resolution of thousands of atoms during reweighting suggests the approach may be applicable in the future to protein-protein binding affinities or nucleic acid thermodynamics.}

  abstract = {Some studies of CFTR imply that channel activation can be explained by an increase in open probability (Po), whereas others suggest that activation involves an increase in the number of CFTR channels (N) in the plasma membrane. Using two-electrode voltage clamp, we tested for changes in N associated with activation of CFTR in Xenopus oocytes using a cysteine-substituted construct (R334C CFTR) that can be modified by externally applied, impairment thiol reagents like [2-(trimethylammonium)ethyl] methanethiosulfonate bromide (MTSET+). Covalent modification of R334C CFTR with MTSET+ doubled the conductance and changed the I-V relation from inward rectifying to linear and was completely reversed by 2-mercaptoethanol (2-ME). Thus, labeled and unlabeled channels could be differentiated by noting the percent decrease in conductance brought about by exposure to 2-ME. When oocytes were briefly (20 s) exposed to MTSET+ before CFTR activation, the subsequently activated conductance was characteristic of labeled R334C CFTR, indicating that the entire pool of CFTR channels activated by cAMP was accessible to MTSET+. The addition of unlabeled, newly synthesized channels to the plasma membrane could be monitored on-line during the time when the rate of addition was most rapid after cRNA injection. The addition of new channels could be detected as early as 5 h after cRNA injection, occurred with a half time of {$\sim$}24-48 h, and was disrupted by exposing oocytes to Brefeldin A, whereas activation of R334C CFTR by cAMP occurred with a half time of tens of minutes, and did not appear to involve the addition of new channels to the plasma membrane. These findings demonstrate that in Xenopus oocytes, the major mechanism of CFTR activation by cAMP is by means of an increase in the open probability of CFTR channels.},

Close resemblance of this human CFTR structure to zebrafish CFTR under identical conditions reinforces its relevance for understanding CFTR function. The human CFTR structure reveals a previously unresolved helix belonging to the R domain docked inside the intracellular vestibule, precluding channel opening. By analyzing the sigmoid time course of CFTR current activation, we propose that PKA phosphorylation of the R domain is enabled by its infrequent spontaneous disengagement, which also explains residual ATPase and gating activity of dephosphorylated CFTR. From comparison with MRP1, a feature distinguishing CFTR from all other ABC transporters is the helix-loop transition in transmembrane helix 8, which likely forms the structural basis for CFTR's channel function.},

  abstract = {Cystic fibrosis is a fatal disease caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). Two main categories of drugs are being developed: correctors that improve folding of CFTR and potentiators that recover the function of CFTR. Here, we report two cryo\textendash electron microscopy structures of human CFTR in complex with potentiators: one with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)\textendash approved drug ivacaftor at 3.3-angstrom resolution and the other with an investigational drug, GLPG1837, at 3.2-angstrom resolution. These two drugs, although chemically dissimilar, bind to the same site within the transmembrane region. Mutagenesis suggests that in both cases, hydrogen bonds provided by the protein are important for drug recognition.The molecular details of how ivacaftor and GLPG1837 interact with CFTR may facilitate structure-based optimization of therapeutic compounds.},

  abstract = {Some studies of CFTR imply that channel activation can be explained by an increase in open probability (Po), whereas others suggest that activation involves an increase in the number of CFTR channels (N) in the plasma membrane. Using two-electrode voltage clamp, we tested for changes in N associated with activation of CFTR in Xenopus oocytes using a cysteine-substituted construct (R334C CFTR) that can be modified by externally applied, impairment thiol reagents like [2-(trimethylammonium)ethyl] methanethiosulfonate bromide (MTSET+). Covalent modification of R334C CFTR with MTSET+ doubled the conductance and changed the I-V relation from inward rectifying to linear and was completely reversed by 2-mercaptoethanol (2-ME). Thus, labeled and unlabeled channels could be differentiated by noting the percent decrease in conductance brought about by exposure to 2-ME. When oocytes were briefly (20 s) exposed to MTSET+ before CFTR activation, the subsequently activated conductance was characteristic of labeled R334C CFTR, indicating that the entire pool of CFTR channels activated by cAMP was accessible to MTSET+. The addition of unlabeled, newly synthesized channels to the plasma membrane could be monitored on-line during the time when the rate of addition was most rapid after cRNA injection. The addition of new channels could be detected as early as 5 h after cRNA injection, occurred with a half time of {$\sim$}24-48 h, and was disrupted by exposing oocytes to Brefeldin A, whereas activation of R334C CFTR by cAMP occurred with a half time of tens of minutes, and did not appear to involve the addition of new channels to the plasma membrane. These findings demonstrate that in Xenopus oocytes, the major mechanism of CFTR activation by cAMP is by means of an increase in the open probability of CFTR channels.},

Here, we present a 3.9~\AA{} structure of dephosphorylated human CFTR without nucleotides, determined by electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM). Close resemblance of this human CFTR structure to zebrafish CFTR under identical conditions reinforces its relevance for understanding CFTR function. The human CFTR structure reveals a previously unresolved helix belonging to the R domain docked inside the intracellular vestibule, precluding channel opening. By analyzing the sigmoid time course of CFTR current activation, we propose that PKA phosphorylation of the R domain is enabled by its infrequent spontaneous disengagement, which also explains residual ATPase and gating activity of dephosphorylated CFTR. From comparison with MRP1, a feature distinguishing CFTR from all other ABC transporters is the helix-loop transition in transmembrane helix 8, which likely forms the structural basis for CFTR's channel function.},

Choline chloride (ChCl) was chosen as typical HBA, and polyethylene glycol (PEG), 1,3-butyleneglycol (BG), ethylene glycol (EG), glycerol (Gl), propionate (Pr), malonic acid (MA) and urea (U) were chosen as HBDs. The extraction and catalytic oxidative desulfurization (ECODS) system was evaluated with phosphotungstic acid (HPW) as catalyst and 30 wt\% H2O2 as oxidant. Among all the neutral, acid and basic DESs, choline chloride/2polyethylene glycol (ChCl/2PEG) showed the best performance and 99.1\% of dibenzothiophene (DBT) could be eliminated from model oil at 50 \textdegree C within 3 h. Interestingly, the volume ratio of DES to model oil was just 1:10, which was much less than the amount of extractant in the literature. The gas chromatography\textendash mass spectrometer (GC\textendash MS) analysis demonstrated that DBT sulfoxide (DBTO) and sulfone (DBTO2) were the products of oxidation of DBT. The desulfurization efficiency of the five sulfides in ECODS system occured in the following order: DBT {$>$} 4-MDBT {$>$} 4,6-DMDBT {$>$} 3-MBT {$>$}BT.},

One of our approaches uses the derivation of the virtual sites used in GROMACS while the other uses a new definition of the virtual sites of the CH2 groups. Our methods is tested on a DPPC (no unsaturated chain), a POPC (one unsaturated chain), and a DOPC (two unsaturated chains) lipid bilayers. We calculate various physical properties of the membrane of our simulations with and without virtual sites and explain the differences and similarity observed. The best agreements are obtained for the GROMACS original virtual sites on the DOPC bilayer where we get an area per lipid of 67.3 {$\pm$} 0.3 A\r{}2 without virtual sites and 67.6 {$\pm$} 0.3 A\r{}2 with virtual sites. In conclusion the virtual-sites technique on lipid membranes is a powerful simulation tool, but it should be used with care. The procedure can be applied to other force fields and lipids in a straightforward manner. (Figure Presented).}

Akt is activated by a combination of binding to the lipid second messenger PI(3,4,5)P3 and its subsequent phosphorylation by phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 and mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 2. The relative contributions of these mechanisms to Akt activity and signaling have hitherto not been understood. Here, we show that phosphorylation and activation by membrane binding are mutually interdependent. Moreover, the converse is also true: Akt is more rapidly dephosphorylated in the absence of PIP3, an autoinhibitory process driven by the interaction of its PH and kinase domains. We present biophysical evidence for the conformational changes in Akt that accompany its activation on membranes, show that Akt is robustly autoinhibited in the absence of PIP3 irrespective of its phosphorylation, and map the autoinhibitory PH-kinase interface. Finally, we present a model for the activation and inactivation of Akt by an ordered series of membrane binding, phosphorylation, dissociation, and dephosphorylation events.},

Here, we present a parallel implementation of linear-scaling density matrix trace correcting (TC) purification algorithm to solve the Kohn\textendash Sham (KS) equations with the numerical atomic orbitals in the HONPAS package. Such a linear-scaling density matrix purification algorithm is based on the Kohn's nearsightedness principle, resulting in a sparse Hamiltonian matrix with localized basis sets in the DFT calculations. Therefore, sparse matrix multiplication is the most time-consuming step in the density matrix purification algorithm for linear-scaling DFT calculations. We propose to use the MPI\_Allgather function for parallel programming to deal with the sparse matrix multiplication within the compressed sparse row (CSR) format, which can scale up to hundreds of processing cores on modern heterogeneous supercomputers. We demonstrate the computational accuracy and efficiency of this parallel density matrix purification algorithm by performing large-scale DFT calculations on boron nitrogen nanotubes containing tens of thousands of atoms.},

When (Ca2+ plus Mg2+)-ATPase activity was measured by 32Pi release from (gamma-32P)ATP, freeze-thawed erythrocytes, as well as membranes prepared at pH 5.8 and at pH 7.6, expressed lower values than noted by assay for total Pi release. When ADP instead of ATP was used as substrate, significant amount of Pi were released by these erythrocyte preparations. Further study revealed (a) production of ATP and AMP from ADP with membranes and hemolysate alone, and (b) exchange of the gamma-and B-position phosphate on (gama-32P)ATP in the presence of membranes plus hemolysates. These observations established the presence of adenylate kinase activity in the (membrane-free) hemolysates and in membranes. It further supports the conclusion that Pi release from ADP by human erythrocytes (freeze-thawed) and by their isolated membranes is due to formation of ATP by adenylate kinase and hydrolysis of this generated ATP by (Ca2+ plus Mg2+)-ATPase. 4. The following points were also established: (a) absence of an ADPase in human erythrocytes; (b) the (Ca2+ plus Mg2+)-ATPase activator enhanced cleavage only of the gama-position of ATP and (c) the (Ca2+ plus Mg2+)-ATPase activator is neither adenylate kinase nor hemoglobin.},

  abstract = {This chapter discusses that high hydrostatic pressure affects equilibria and reaction rates through the molar volume changes involved in the reaction system as a whole. The chapter explains how high hydrostatic pressure affects molecules of biological interest, and their interactions; the ways in which pressure affects cellular processes; and how animals, including humans are affected by pressure. Along with high pressure, the chapter also intends to stimulate interest in a particular approach to physiology. The discussion on molecular effects of pressure and temperature includes equilibrium processes in aqueous solution, lipid bilayers under pressure and rates of chemical reactions. It is mentioned that hydrostatic pressure is not directional and that osmotic pressure is also quite separate from hydrostatic pressure. Hydrostatic pressure is a force acting in all directions, in the air one breathes, in water, or in body fluids. While high pressure, surprisingly perhaps, dissociates molecules in aqueous solution, it has the intuitively expected effect on lipid bilayers, compressing and ordering their structure. The thermodynamics of equilibrium processes in aqueous solution, and the phase state of lipid bilayers at high pressure, inevitably fall short of explaining how pressure affects rates of reaction. Muscle, a tissue whose cells are conspicuously filled with polymerized proteins, is affected by high pressure in ways determined by the contraction cycle. Simple processes, such as the diffusion of gases or water in aqueous solution, are little affected by the pressure range of interest here. Chondrocytes are cells, which synthesize the load-bearing extracellular matrixthat covers the articulating surfaces of joints. The buoyancy of aquatic animals subjected to significant pressure is interesting because buoyancy requires the creation of a void or region of low-density, working against the ambient pressure. Animals and bacteria live at high pressures in the deep sea, down to the greatest depths where the pressure is approximately 100 MPa. Several technological applications have arisen from high pressure biology\textemdash the manipulation of ploidy, and of membrane proteins; sterilization and inactivation of microorganisms; food processing; and safe human diving.},

All-atom and coarse-grained models have been extensively used to understand the protein\textendash protein interactions in the membrane and to compute equilibrium association constants. However, slow translational and rotational diffusion of protein in membrane presents challenges to the effective sampling of conformations defining the ensembles of free and bound states contributing to the association equilibrium and the free energy of dimerization. We revisit the homodimerization equilibrium of the TM region of glycophorin A. Conformational sampling is performed using umbrella sampling along previously proposed one-dimensional collective variables and compared with sampling over a two-dimensional collective variable space using the MARTINI v2.2 force field. We demonstrate that the one-dimensional collective variables suffer from restricted sampling of the native homodimer conformations leading to a biased free energy landscape. Conversely, simulations along the two-dimensional collective variable effectively characterize the thermodynamically relevant native and non-native interactions contributing to the association equilibrium. These results demonstrate the challenges associated with accurately characterizing binding equilibria when multiple poses contribute to the bound state ensemble.},

  abstract = {We develop force field parameters for the divalent cations Mg2+, Ca2+, Sr2+, and Ba2+ for molecular dynamics simulations with the simple point charge-extended (SPC/E) water model. We follow an approach introduced recently for the optimization of monovalent ions, based on the simultaneous optimization of single-ion and ion-pair properties. We consider the solvation free energy of the divalent cations as the relevant single-ion property. As a probe for ion-pair properties we compute the activity derivatives of the salt solutions. The optimization of the ionic force fields is done in two consecutive steps. First, the cation solvation free energy is determined as a function of the Lennard-Jones (LJ) parameters. The peak in the ion-water radial distribution function (RDF) is used as a check of the structural properties of the ions. Second, the activity derivatives of the electrolytes MgY2, CaY2, BaY2, SrY2 are determined through Kirkwood-Buff solution theory, where Y = Cl-, Br-, I-. The activity derivatives are determined for the restricted set of LJ parameters which reproduce the exact solvation free energy of the divalent cations. The optimal ion parameters are those that match the experimental activity data and therefore simultaneously reproduce single-ion and ion-pair thermodynamic properties. For Ca2+, Ba2+, and Sr2+ such LJ parameters exist. On the other hand, for Mg2+ the experimental activity derivatives can only be reproduced if we generalize the combination rule for the anion-cation LJ interaction and rescale the effective cation-anion LJ radius, which is a modification that leaves the cation solvation free energy invariant. The divalent cation force fields are transferable within acceptable accuracy, meaning the same cation force field is valid for all halide ions Cl-, Br-, I- tested in this study.},

  abstract = {Paralysis occurring in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) results from denervation of skeletal muscle as a consequence of motor neuron degeneration. Interactions between motor neurons and glia contribute to motor neuron loss, but the spatiotemporal ordering of molecular events that drive these processes in intact spinal tissue remains poorly understood. Here, we use spatial transcriptomics to obtain gene expression measurements of mouse spinal cords over the course of disease, as well as of postmortem tissue from ALS patients, to characterize the underlying molecular mechanisms in ALS. We identify pathway dynamics, distinguish regional differences between microglia and astrocyte populations at early time points, and discern perturbations in several transcriptional pathways shared between murine models of ALS and human postmortem spinal cords.}

Despite their importance, our understanding of protein PTMs at the atomistic level is still largely incomplete. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, which provide high-resolution insight into biomolecular function and underlying mechanisms, are in principle ideally suited to tackle this problem. However, because of the challenges associated with the development of novel MD parameters and a general lack of suitable computational tools for incorporating PTMs in target protein structures, MD simulations of post-translationally modified proteins have historically lagged significantly behind the studies of unmodified proteins. Here, we present Vienna-PTM web server (http://vienna-ptm.univie.ac.at), a platform for automated introduction of PTMs of choice to protein 3D structures (PDB files) in a user-friendly visual environment. With 256 different enzymatic and non-enzymatic PTMs available, the server performs geometrically realistic introduction of modifications at sites of interests, as well as subsequent energy minimization. Finally, the server makes available force field parameters and input files needed to run MD simulations of modified proteins within the framework of the widely used GROMOS 54A7 and 45A3 force fields and GROMACS simulation package.}

There are, however, a few striking effects in performance of algorithms which are well known but have not received adequate attention in the literature. A closer view of these unclear observations results in unexpected conclusions. It is shown here that contrary to the conventional point of view, the leapfrog scheme is distinguished in this group both in terms of the order of truncation errors and the conservation of the total energy. In this case the characteristic square growth of fluctuations of the total energy with the step size, commonly measured in numerical tests, results from additional interpolation errors with no relation to the accuracy of the computed trajectory. An alternative procedure is described for checking energy conservation of leapfrog-like algorithms which is free from interpolation errors. Preliminary tests on a representative model system suggest that standard step size values used at present are lower than necessary for accurate sampling.},

However, much remains to be understood about what governs which regions of the protein (un)folding funnel, which can be explored by activation of protein ions in a vacuum. Here, we examine the trajectory that Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1) dimers take over the unfolding and dissociation free energy landscape in a vacuum. We examined wild-type SOD1 and six disease-related point mutants by using tandem MS and ion-mobility MS as a function of collisional activation. For six of the seven SOD1 variants, increasing activation prompted dimers to transition through two unfolding events and dissociate symmetrically into monomers with (as near as possible) equal charges. The exception was G37R, which proceeded only through the first unfolding transition and displayed a much higher abundance of asymmetric products. Supported by the observation that ejected asymmetric G37R monomers were more compact than symmetric G37R ones, we localized this effect to the formation of a gas-phase salt bridge in the first activated conformation. To examine the data quantitatively, we applied Arrhenius-type analysis to estimate the barriers on the corresponding free energy landscape. This reveals a heightening of the barrier to unfolding in G37R by {$>$}5 kJ/mol-1 over the other variants, consistent with expectations for the strength of a salt bridge. Our work demonstrates weaknesses in the simple general framework for understanding protein complex dissociation in a vacuum and highlights the importance of individual residues, their local environment, and specific interactions in governing product formation.}

  abstract = {Although the like-dissolves-like rule is often invoked to explain why sodium chloride dissolves in water, hidden behind this explanation is the delicate balance between the very large cohesive energy of the ionic crystal and large solvation energies of the ions. Room-temperature ionic liquids (ILs) are liquid analogues of ionic crystals and, as dictated by a similar energetic balance, may either fully mix with water or be immiscible with water depending on ion type and cation/anion combination. In this work, we study three hydrophobic and three hydrophilic ILs to examine whether a priori prediction of water miscibility is possible based on analysis of bulk properties alone. We find that hydrophilic and hydrophobic ILs exhibit distinct signatures in their (reciprocal space) Coulomb interactions that indicate predisposition to water mixing. Hydrophilic ILs exhibit a prominent peak in their electrostatic interactions at 58-length scale, largely due to repulsion between neighboring anion shells. When mixed with water, this peak is significantly reduced in magnitude, indicating that electrostatic screening by water molecules is an important driving force for mixing. In contrast, hydrophobic ILs show no such peak, indicating no predisposition to mixing. In addition to this analysis, we compute and compare solvation free energies of the six different anions in water, ion-pairing free energies at infinitely dilute concentration, and water absorption free energies in the different ILs. Analyzed within the context of empirical data, our calculations suggest that hydrophobicity trends of different ILs are very sensitive to precise water content at dilute conditions. For example, we predict that bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide-based ILs exhibit anomalously large water absorption free energies at zero water content, with increasing hydrophobicity as preferential absorption sites within the IL become saturated.}

  abstract = {Although the like-dissolves-like rule is often invoked to explain why sodium chloride dissolves in water, hidden behind this explanation is the delicate balance between the very large cohesive energy of the ionic crystal and large solvation energies of the ions. Room-temperature ionic liquids (ILs) are liquid analogues of ionic crystals and, as dictated by a similar energetic balance, may either fully mix with water or be immiscible with water depending on ion type and cation/anion combination. In this work, we study three hydrophobic and three hydrophilic ILs to examine whether a priori prediction of water miscibility is possible based on analysis of bulk properties alone. We find that hydrophilic and hydrophobic ILs exhibit distinct signatures in their (reciprocal space) Coulomb interactions that indicate predisposition to water mixing. Hydrophilic ILs exhibit a prominent peak in their electrostatic interactions at 58-length scale, largely due to repulsion between neighboring anion shells. When mixed with water, this peak is significantly reduced in magnitude, indicating that electrostatic screening by water molecules is an important driving force for mixing. In contrast, hydrophobic ILs show no such peak, indicating no predisposition to mixing. In addition to this analysis, we compute and compare solvation free energies of the six different anions in water, ion-pairing free energies at infinitely dilute concentration, and water absorption free energies in the different ILs. Analyzed within the context of empirical data, our calculations suggest that hydrophobicity trends of different ILs are very sensitive to precise water content at dilute conditions. For example, we predict that bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide-based ILs exhibit anomalously large water absorption free energies at zero water content, with increasing hydrophobicity as preferential absorption sites within the IL become saturated.}

Eighteen time points from 30 milliseconds to 30 seconds cover four turnover cycles of the irreversible reaction. They reveal sequential substrate binding, covalent-intermediate formation, setup of a hydrolytic water molecule, and product release. Small structural changes of the protein mold and variations in the number and placement of water molecules accompany the various chemical steps of catalysis.

  abstract = {Spontaneous transitions between the native and non-native protein conformations are normally rare events that hardly take place in typical unbiased molecular dynamics simulations. It was recently demonstrated that such transitions can be well described by a reaction coordinate, Q, that represents the collective fraction of the native contacts between the protein atoms. Here we attempt to use this reaction coordinate to enhance the conformational sampling. We perform umbrella sampling simulations with biasing potentials on Q for two model proteins, Trp-Cage and BBA, using the CHARMM force field. Hamiltonian replica exchange is implemented in these simulations to further facilitate the sampling. The simulations appear to have reached satisfactory convergence, resulting in unbiased free energies as a function of Q. In addition to the native structure, multiple folded conformations are identified in the reconstructed equilibrium ensemble. Some conformations without any native contacts nonetheless have rather compact geometries and are stabilized by hydrogen bonds not present in the native structure. Whereas the enhanced sampling along Q reasonably reproduces the equilibrium conformational space, we also find that the folding of an {$\alpha$}-helix in Trp-Cage is a slow degree of freedom orthogonal to Q and therefore cannot be accelerated by biasing the reaction coordinate. Overall, we conclude that whereas Q is an excellent parameter to analyze the simulations, it is not necessarily a perfect reaction coordinate for enhanced sampling, and better incorporation of other slow degrees of freedom may further improve this reaction coordinate.},

We tested different water contents in these ILs at room temperature (298 K) and high temperature (343 K), and we observe that the enzyme structure is highly dependent on the amount of water present in the IL media. We show that the enzyme is preferentially stabilized in [BMIM][PF6] at 5-10\% (w/w) (weight of water over protein) water content at room temperature. [BMIM][PF 6] renders a more nativelike enzyme structure at the same water content of 5-10\% (w/w) as previously found for hexane, and the system displays a similar bell-shape-like dependence with the water content in the IL media. [BMIM][PF6] is shown to increase significantly the protein thermostability at high temperatures, especially at low hydration.

  abstract = {We present in this work the first molecular simulation study of an enzyme, the serine protease cutinase from Fusarium solani pisi, in two ionic liquids (ILs): 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate ([BMIM]-[PF6]) and 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium nitrate ([BMIM][NO3]). We tested different water contents in these ILs at room temperature (298 K) and high temperature (343 K), and we observe that the enzyme structure is highly dependent on the amount of water present in the IL media. We show that the enzyme is preferentially stabilized in [BMIM][PF6] at 5-10\% (w/w) (weight of water over protein) water content at room temperature. [BMIM][PF 6] renders a more nativelike enzyme structure at the same water content of 5-10\% (w/w) as previously found for hexane, and the system displays a similar bell-shape-like dependence with the water content in the IL media. [BMIM][PF6] is shown to increase significantly the protein thermostability at high temperatures, especially at low hydration. Our analysis indicates that the enzyme is less stabilized in [BMIM]-[NO3] relative to [BMIM][PF6] at both temperatures, most likely due to the strong affinity of the [NO3]- anion toward the protein main chain. These findings are in accordance with the experimental knowledge for these two ionic liquids.

Academics are beginning to ask whether post-explosion forensics might create a replacement for an international nonproliferation regime, or at least offer a fallback option to deter states and individuals from selling nuclear materials. This paper examines current attribution technology from unclassified literature and finds the technology to be well developed but not foolproof, such that nuclear attribution currently provides little deterrent value. If current capabilities were publicized more thoroughly and if the post-explosion process of assessing the evidence were internationalized, states and intermediate actors might be deterred more effectively. Developing a nuclear fingerprint database is also discussed. While useful, its impact on deterrence would be minimal.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Riluzole is approved for the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis in most countries. Questions persist about its clinical utility because of high cost and modest efficacy. OBJECTIVES To examine the efficacy of riluzole in prolonging survival and in delaying the use of surrogates (tracheostomy and mechanical ventilation) to sustain survival, and to assess the effect of riluzole upon functional health. SEARCH METHODS We searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Specialized Register (20 April 2011), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2011, Issue 2), MEDLINE (1966 to April 2011), EMBASE (1980 to May 2011) and made enquiries of authors of trials, Aventis (manufacturer of riluzole) and other experts in the field. SELECTION CRITERIA Types of studies: randomized controlled trials TYPES OF PARTICIPANTS adults with a diagnosis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis Types of interventions: treatment with riluzole or placebo Types of outcome measures: Primary: pooled hazard ratio of tracheostomy-free survival over all time points with riluzole 100 mg. Secondary: per cent mortality with riluzole 50 mg, 100 mg and 200 mg; neurologic function, muscle strength and adverse events. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS One author performed data extraction and two other authors checked them. One author checked the data and entered them into the computer. The other authors verified the data entry. We obtained missing data from the trial authors whenever possible. MAIN RESULTS The four trials examining tracheostomy-free survival included a total of 974 riluzole-treated patients and 503 placebo-treated patients. No new randomized controlled trials were found when we updated the searches for this update in 2011. The methodological quality was acceptable and three trials were easily comparable, although one trial (169 participants) included older patients in more advanced stages of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and one (195 participants) had multiple primary endpoints. Riluzole 100 mg per day provided a benefit for the homogeneous group of patients in the first two trials (hazard ratio (HR) 0.80, 95\% confidence internal (CI) 0.64 to 0.99, P= 0.042) and there was no evidence of heterogeneity (P = 0.33). When the third trial (which included older and more seriously affected patients) was added, there was evidence of heterogeneity (P {$<$} 0.0001) and the overall treatment effect was reduced but still significant (HR 0.84, 95\% CI 0.698 to 0.997, P= 0.046). This represented a 9\% gain in the probability of surviving one year (49\% in the placebo and 58\% in the riluzole group), and increased median survival from 11.8 to 14.8 months. There was a small beneficial effect on both bulbar and limb function, but not on muscle strength. A three-fold increase in serum alanine transferase was more frequent in riluzole-treated patients than controls (mean difference 2.62, 95\% CI 1.59 to 4.31). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS Riluzole 100 mg daily is reasonably safe and probably prolongs median survival by about two to three months in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.}

The molecular basis of the effect of urea and guanidinium chloride (GdmCl) on polypeptide chains is still not well understood. Models for denaturant-protein interaction include both direct binding and indirect changes in solvent properties. Here we report studies on the effect of urea and GdmCl on the rate constants (kc) of end-to-end diffusion in unstructured poly(glycine-serine) chains of different length. Urea and GdmCl both lead to a linear decrease of ln kc with denaturant concentration, as observed for the rate constants for protein folding. This suggests that the effect of denaturants on chain dynamics significantly contributes to the denaturant-dependence of folding rate constants for small proteins. We show that this linear dependency is the result of two additive non-linear effects, namely increased solvent viscosity and denaturant binding. The contribution from denaturant binding can be quantitatively described by Schellman's weak binding model with binding constants (K) of 0.62({$\pm$}0.01) M-1 for GdmCl and 0.26({$\pm$}0.01) M-1 for urea. In our model peptides the number of binding sites and the effect of a bound denaturant molecule on chain dynamics is identical for urea and GdmCl. The results further identify the polypeptide backbone as the major denaturant binding site and give an upper limit of a few nanoseconds for residence times of denaturant molecules on the polypeptide chain. \textcopyright{} 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

The thermal stability of the enzyme was also evaluated in DESs, water, and 8M urea. The enzyme showed very good conformational stability in the urea:choline chloride mixture with about 66\% urea (9 M) even at high temperatures. The results are in good agreement with recent experimental observations. In contrast, complete enzyme denaturation occurred in 8M urea with only 12\% urea in water. It was found that urea molecules denature the enzyme by interrupting the intra-chain hydrogen bonds in a "direct denaturation mechanism". However, in a urea:choline chloride deep eutectic solvent, as a result of hydrogen bonding with choline and chloride ions, urea molecules have a low diffusion coefficient and cannot reach the protein domains. Interestingly, urea, choline, and chloride ions form hydrogen bonds with the surface residues of the enzyme which, instead of lipase denaturation, leads to greater enzyme stability.

Although molecular dynamics is an effective approach for investigating different aspects of lipid bilayers, to the best of our knowledge, there is no review in the literature that explains the different analyses that can be carried out with membrane simulation. This review gives an overview about the some of the most important possible analyses, technical challenges, and existing protocols that can be performed on the biological membrane by molecular dynamics simulation. The reviewed analyses include the degree of membrane disruption, average area per lipid, probability distributions for the area per lipid molecule, membrane thickness, membrane area compressibility, lateral diffusion, rotational diffusion, order parameters, head group tilt, electron density profile, mass density profile, electrostatic potential profile, ordering of vicinity waters, number of hydrogen bonds, and radial distribution function.}

The expression explicitly states the RDF as a continuous function of reduced interparticle distance, temperature, and density. It satisfies the limiting conditions of zero density and infinite distance imposed by statistical thermodynamics. The distance dependence of this expression is expressed by an equation which contains 11 adjustable parameters. These parameters are fitted to 353 RDF data, obtained by molecular dynamics calculations, and then expressed as functions of reduced distance, temperature and density. This expression, having a total of 65 constants, reproduces the RDF data with an average root-mean-squared deviation of 0.0152 for the range of state variables of 0.5{$\leqslant$}T{${_\ast}\leqslant$}5.1 and 0.35{$\leqslant\rho{_\ast}\leqslant$}1.1 (T{${_\ast}$}=kT/{$\epsilon$} and {$\rho{_\ast}$}={$\rho\sigma$}3 are reduced temperature and density, respectively).

Benorylate had a satisfactory effect in 28 patients. Additional treatment was requried in 3 cases and treatment discontinued in 2 cases. Distinct improvement of grip strength, morning stiffness and E.S.R. in 25 cases indicates the anti-inflammatory efficacy of benorylate. There were no signs of toxicity to bone marrow, liver or kidney. Severe side effects such as stomch ulcers, gastrointestinal bleeding and severe allergic complications were not observed. Side effects such as constipation and tinnitus that occurred at the beginning of treatment were mainly of a a passing nature and disappeared without a need to change therapy. Benorylate is suitable for the treatment of recent rheumatoid arthritis of a low to moderate activity as well as for long-term treatment.},

The heterogeneity of lipid composition of biological membranes and the effect of lipid molecules on the structure, dynamics, and function of membrane proteins are now widely recognized. Characterization of these functionally important lipid-protein interactions with experimental techniques is however still prohibitively challenging. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations offer a powerful complementary approach with sufficient temporal and spatial resolutions to gain atomic-level structural information and energetics on lipid-protein interactions. In this review, we aim to provide a broad survey of MD simulations focusing on exploring lipid-protein interactions and characterizing lipid-modulated protein structure and dynamics that have been successful in providing novel insight into the mechanism of membrane protein function.}

  abstract = {The cellular membrane constitutes one of the most fundamental compartments of a living cell, where key processes such as selective transport of material and exchange of information between the cell and its environment are mediated by proteins that are closely associated with the membrane. The heterogeneity of lipid composition of biological membranes and the effect of lipid molecules on the structure, dynamics, and function of membrane proteins are now widely recognized. Characterization of these functionally important lipid-protein interactions with experimental techniques is however still prohibitively challenging. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations offer a powerful complementary approach with sufficient temporal and spatial resolutions to gain atomic-level structural information and energetics on lipid-protein interactions. In this review, we aim to provide a broad survey of MD simulations focusing on exploring lipid-protein interactions and characterizing lipid-modulated protein structure and dynamics that have been successful in providing novel insight into the mechanism of membrane protein function.}

  abstract = {Separation of aromatics from aliphatics is a challenging process because of the close range of their boiling points and the formation of several combinations of azeotropes. Until now, no feasible separation process is available for aromatic concentrations below 20 wt\%. In this work, we have investigated the possibility of using a selected deep eutectic solvent (DES) for the liquid-liquid extraction of benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and m-xylene (BTEX) aromatics. The DES used in this work was synthesized by combining tetrabutylammonium salt and sulfolane. Equilibrium data for the ternary system consisting of BTEX aromatics, n-octane and DES were measured at 25 \textdegree C and atmospheric pressure. The results showed that the used DESs have comparable distribution ratios and selectivities to those of commercial solvents. In all tested systems, sulfolane was not present in the hydrocarbon layer. It was also found that the selectivity decreases with decreasing polarity of the aromatic compound. The Non-Random Two Liquid (NRTL) model was successfully used to correlate the experimental tie-lines and to calculate the phase compositions of the ternary systems. In addition, the performance of COSMO-RS to predict the ternary tie-lines for the studied systems was evaluated and the {$\sigma$}-profiles were used to explain the interaction between the DES and the aromatic compounds.

  abstract = {Understanding the energetics of peripheral protein-membrane interactions is important to many areas of biophysical chemistry and cell biology. Estimating free-energy landscapes by molecular dynamics (MD) simulation is challenging for such systems, especially when membrane recognition involves complex lipids, e.g., phosphatidylinositol phosphates (PIPs). We combined coarse-grained MD simulations with umbrella sampling to quantify the binding of the well-explored GRP1 pleckstrin homology (PH) domain to model membranes containing PIP molecules. The experimentally observed preference of GRP1-PH for PIP3 over PIP2 was reproduced. Mutation of a key residue (K273A) within the canonical PIP-binding site significantly reduced the free energy of PIP binding. The presence of a noncanonical PIP-interaction site, observed experimentally in other PH domains but not previously in GRP1-PH, was also revealed. These studies demonstrate how combining coarse-grained simulations and umbrella sampling can unmask the molecular basis of the energetics of interactions between peripheral membrane proteins and complex cellular membranes.}

Experimental measurements of the second virial coefficient of lysozyme and bovine {$\alpha$}-chymotrypsinogen A were performed by static light scattering, as a function of pH and electrolyte concentration. Although some of the trends can be explained qualitatively by simple colloidal models of protein interactions, a more realistic interpretation based on protein crystallographic structures suggests a different explanation of experimental trends. The interactions accounted for are solute-solute excluded volume (steric), electrostatic and short-range (mainly van der Waals) interactions. The interactions depend strongly on orientation, and this profoundly affects calculated second virial coefficients. We find that molecular configurations in which complementary surfaces are apposed contribute disproportionately to the second virial coefficient, mainly through short-range interactions; electrostatic interactions play a secondary role in many of these configurations. Thus molecular recognition events can play a role in determining the solution thermodynamic properties of proteins, and this provides a plausible basis for explaining the observed relationship with crystallization behavior. \textcopyright{} 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

One surprising aspect of these structures was the finding that the eighth of CFTR's 12 membrane-spanning segments (TM8) appeared close to the channel pore. Although functional evidence supports a role for other TMs in forming the pore, such a role for TM8 has not previously been reported. Here, we use patch-clamp recording to investigate the functional role of TM8. Using substituted cysteine accessibility mutagenesis, we find that three amino acid side-chains in TM8 (Y913, Y914, and Y917) are exposed to the extracellular, but not the intracellular, solution. Cysteine cross-linking experiments suggest that Y914 and Y917 are in close proximity to L102 (TM1) and F337 (TM6), respectively, suggesting that TM8 contributes to the narrow selectivity filter region of the pore. Different amino acid substitutions suggest that Y914, and to a lesser extent Y917, play important roles in controlling anion flux through the open channel. Furthermore, substitutions that reduce side-chain volume at Y917 severely affect channel gating, resulting in a channel with an extremely unstable open state. Our results suggest that pore-lining TM8 is among the most important TMs controlling the permeation phenotype of the CFTR channel, and also that movement of TM8 may be critically involved in channel gating.},

  abstract = {Despite the progress in modeling complex molecular systems of ever-increasing complexity, a quantitatively accurate computational treatment of ion permeation through narrow membrane channels remains challenging. An important factor to reach this goal is induced electronic polarization, which is likely to impact the permeation rate of small ions through narrow molecular pores. In this work, we extended the recently developed polarizable force field based on the classical Drude oscillators to assess the role of induced polarization effects on the energetics of sodium and potassium ion transport across the gramicidin A (gA) ion channel. The inclusion of induced polarization lowers barriers present in 1D potential of mean force (PMF) for cation permeation by {$\sim$}50\% compared to those obtained with the additive force field. Conductance properties calculated with 1D PMFs from Drude simulations are in better agreement with experimental results. Polarization of single-file water molecules and protein atoms forming the narrow pore has a direct impact on the free-energy barriers and cation-specific solid-state NMR chemical shifts. Sensitivity analysis indicates that small changes to water\textendash channel interactions can alter the free energy barrier for ion permeation. These results, illustrating polarization effects present in the complex electrostatic environment of the gA channel, have broad implications for revising proposed mechanisms of ion permeation and selectivity in a variety of ion channels.}

Here, we suggest an approach for modeling the slow parts of Markov processes by approximating the dominant eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of the propagator.

  abstract = {The stability of the crystal structure of the multidrug transporter P-glycoprotein proposed by Aller et al. (PDBid 3G5U) has been examined under different environmental conditions using molecular dynamics. We show that in the presence of the detergent cholate, the structure of P-glycoprotein solved at pH 7.5 is stable. However, when incorporated into a cholesterol-enriched POPC membrane in the presence of 150 mM NaCl, the structure rapidly deforms. Only when the simulation conditions closely matched the experimental conditions under which P-glycoprotein is transport active was a stable conformation obtained. Specifically, the presence of Mg 2+, which bound to distinct sites in the nucleotide binding domains (NBDs), and the double protonation of the catalytic histidines (His583 and His1228) and His149 were required. While the structure obtained in a membrane environment under these conditions is very similar to the crystal structure of Aller et al., there are several key differences. The NBDs are in direct contact, reminiscent of the open state of MalK. The angle between the transmembrane domains is also increased, resulting in an outward motion of the intracellular loops. Notably, the structures obtained from the simulations provide a better match to a range of experimental cross-linking data than does the original 3G5U-a crystal structure. This work highlights the effect small changes in environmental conditions can have of the conformation of a membrane protein and the importance of representing the experimental conditions appropriately in modeling studies. \textcopyright{} 2012 American Chemical Society.}

  abstract = {We have developed an enhanced conformational sampling method combining replica-exchange umbrella sampling (REUS) with Gaussian accelerated molecular dynamics (GaMD). REUS enhances the sampling along predefined reaction coordinates, while GaMD accelerates the conformational dynamics by adding a boost potential to the system energy. The method, which we call GaREUS (Gaussian accelerated replica-exchange umbrella sampling), enhances the sampling more efficiently than REUS or GaMD, while the computational resource for GaREUS is the same as that required for REUS. The two-step reweighting procedure using the multistate Bennett acceptance ratio method and the cumulant expansion for the exponential average is applied to the simulation trajectories for obtaining the unbiased free-energy landscapes. We apply GaREUS to the calculations of free-energy landscapes for three different cases: conformational equilibria of N-glycan, folding of chignolin, and conformational change of adenyl kinase. We show that GaREUS speeds up the convergences of free-energy calculations using the same amount of computational resources as REUS. The free-energy landscapes reweighted from the trajectories of GaREUS agree with previously reported ones. GaREUS is applicable to free-energy calculations of various biomolecular dynamics and functions with reasonable computational costs.}

  abstract = {Deep eutectic solvents (DESs) have shown tremendous promise as green solvents with low toxicity and cost. Understanding molecular aggregation processes within DESs will not only enhance the application potential of these solvents but also help alleviate some of the limitations associated with them. Among DESs, those comprising choline chloride and appropriate hydrogen-bond donors are inexpensive and easy to prepare. On the basis of fluorescence probe, electrical conductivity, and surface tension experiments, we present the first clear lines of evidence for self-aggregation of an anionic surfactant within a DES containing a small fraction of water. Namely, well-defined assemblies of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) apparently form in the archetype DES Reline comprising a 1:2 molar mixture of choline chloride and urea. Significant enhancement in the solubility of organic solvents that are otherwise not miscible in choline chloride-based DESs is achieved within Reline in the presence of SDS. The remarkably improved solubility of cyclohexane within SDS-added Reline is attributed to the presence of spontaneously formed cyclohexane-in-Reline microemulsions by SDS under ambient conditions. Surface tension, dynamic light scattering (DLS), small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), density, and dynamic viscosity measurements along with responses from the fluorescence dipolarity and microfluidity probes of pyrene and 1,3-bis(1-pyrenyl)propane are employed to characterize these aggregates. Such water-free oil-in-DES microemulsions are appropriately sized to be considered as a new type of nanoreactor.}

An estimate of the polarity associated with DESs is essential if they are to be used as green alternatives to common organic solvents in industries and academia. As no one physical parameter can satisfactorily represent solute-solvent interactions within a medium, polarity of DESs is assessed through solvatochromic optical spectroscopic responses of several UV-vis absorbance and molecular fluorescence probes. Information on the local microenvironment (i.e., the cybotactic region) that surrounds several solvatochromic probes [betaine dye, pyrene, pyrene-1-carboxaldehyde, 1-anilino-8-naphthalene sulfonate (ANS), p-toluidinyl-6-naphthalene sulfonate (TNS), 6-propionyl-2-(dimethylaminonaphthalene) (PRODAN), coumarin-153, and Nile Red] for four common and popular DESs formed from choline chloride combined with 1,2-ethanediol, glycerol, urea, and malonic acid, respectively, in 1 : 2 molar ratios termed ethaline, glyceline, reline, and maline is obtained and used to assess the effective polarity afforded by each of these DESs. The four DESs as indicated by these probe responses are found to be fairly dipolar in nature. Absorbance probe betaine dye and fluorescence probes ANS, TNS, PRODAN, coumarin-153, and Nile Red, whose solvatochromic responses are based on photoinduced charge-transfer, imply ethaline and glyceline, DESs formed using alcohol-based H-bond donors, to be relatively more dipolar in nature as compared to reline and maline. The pyrene polarity scale, which is based on polarity-induced changes in vibronic bands, indicates reline, the DES composed of urea as the hydrogen bond donor, to be significantly more dipolar than the other three DESs. Response of pyrene-1-carboxaldehyde, a polarity probe based on inversion of n-{$\pi$}* and {$\pi$}-{$\pi$}* states, hints at maline to be the most dipolar of the four DESs. The molecular structure of the H-bond donor in a DES clearly controls the dipolarity afforded by the DES. H-bonding and other specific solute-solvent interactions are found to play an important role in solvatochromic probe behavior for the four DESs.

  abstract = {Gaussian accelerated molecular dynamics (GaMD) is a recently developed enhanced sampling technique that provides efficient free energy calculations of biomolecules. Like the previous accelerated molecular dynamics (aMD), GaMD allows for "unconstrained" enhanced sampling without the need to set predefined collective variables and so is useful for studying complex biomolecular conformational changes such as protein folding and ligand binding. Furthermore, because the boost potential is constructed using a harmonic function that follows Gaussian distribution in GaMD, cumulant expansion to the second order can be applied to recover the original free energy profiles of proteins and other large biomolecules, which solves a long-standing energetic reweighting problem of the previous aMD method. Taken together, GaMD offers major advantages for both unconstrained enhanced sampling and free energy calculations of large biomolecules. Here, we have implemented GaMD in the NAMD package on top of the existing aMD feature and validated it on three model systems: alanine dipeptide, the chignolin fast-folding protein, and the M3 muscarinic G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR). For alanine dipeptide, while conventional molecular dynamics (cMD) simulations performed for 30 ns are poorly converged, GaMD simulations of the same length yield free energy profiles that agree quantitatively with those of 1000 ns cMD simulation. Further GaMD simulations have captured folding of the chignolin and binding of the acetylcholine (ACh) endogenous agonist to the M3 muscarinic receptor. The reweighted free energy profiles are used to characterize the protein folding and ligand binding pathways quantitatively. GaMD implemented in the scalable NAMD is widely applicable to enhanced sampling and free energy calculations of large biomolecules.},

In the present work, the application of DES (formed by binary mixtures of cholinium chloride and carboxylic acids or urea) as phase-forming components of aqueous biphasic systems (ABS) is investigated. The mechanisms associated with the phases demixing of ABS composed of DES, as well as the DES stability in aqueous solutions, are investigated to address the critical question whether DES-based ABS are in fact ternary or quaternary mixtures. It is shown that the DES integrity is destroyed in ABS by the disruption of the hydrogen-bonding interactions of the complex (a result of the isolated components preferential solvation by water), and as confirmed by a nonstoichiometric partition of the DES components between the coexisting phases. As a result, there are no "real" DES-based ABS; instead, there is the formation of ABS composed of four components, where the carboxylic acid used as the hydrogen-bond donor species seems to act as an additive. Finally, it is shown that these ABS have an outstanding potential to be used in extraction processes, as it is here demonstrated with the complete separation of two dyes. However, the volatile nature of short chain carboxylic acids and the nonstoichiometric partition of the DES components in ABS make the development of recovery and recycling steps more difficult to accomplish.},

The maturation defect can be partially rescued by low-temperature (27\textdegree C) cell culture conditions or small-molecule corrector compounds. Following its partial rescue, the open probability of F508del-CFTR is enhanced by the potentiator compound, VX-770. However, the channel activity of rescued F508del-CFTR remains less than that of the Wt-CFTR protein in the presence of VX-770. In this study, we asked if there are allosteric effects of F508del on the phosphorylation-regulated R domain. To identify defects in the R domain, we compared the phosphorylation status at protein kinase A sites in the R domain of Wt and F508del-CFTR. Here we show that phosphorylation of Ser-660, quantified by SRM-MS, is reduced in F508del-CFTR. Although the generation of a phosphomimic at this site (substituting aspartic acid for serine) did not modify the maturation defect, it did enhance F508del-CFTR channel function after pharmacological rescue with corrector VX-809, and treatment with the potentiator, VX-770.

These simulations represent an extension of our previous work on kinetically irreversible protein aggregate structure and are based on an explicit accounting of the specific protein-protein interactions that occur within reversible aggregates and crystals. We considered protein monomers with a mixture of hydrophobic and hydrophilic surface regions suspended in a polar solvent; the energetic driving force for aggregation is provided by the burial of solvent-exposed hydrophobic surface area. We analyzed the physical properties of the generated aggregates, including density, protein-protein contact distributions, solvent accessible surface area, porosity, and order, and compared our results with the protein crystallization literature as well as with the kinetically irreversible case. The physical properties of reversible aggregates were consonant with those observed for the irreversible aggregates, although in general, reversible aggregates were more stable energetically and were more crystal-like in their order content than their irreversible counterparts. The reversible aggregates were less dense than the irreversible aggregates, indicating that the increased energetic stability is derived primarily from the optimality rather than the density of the packing in the solid phase. The extent of hydrophobic protein-protein contacts and solvent-exposed surface area within the aggregate phase depended on the aggregation pathway: reversible aggregates tended to have a greater proportion of hydrophobic-hydrophobic contacts and a smaller fraction of hydrophobic solvent-exposed surface area. Furthermore, the arrangement of hydrophobic patches on the protein surface played a major role in the distribution of protein contacts and solvent content. This was readily reflected in the order of the aggregates: the greater the contiguity of the hydrophobic patches on the monomer surface, the less ordered the aggregates became, despite the opportunities for rearrangement offered by a reversible pathway.

To identify small-molecule correctors of defective cellular processing, we assayed iodide flux in {$\Delta$}F508-CFTR-transfected epithelial cells using a fluorescent halide indicator. Screening of 150,000 chemically diverse compounds and more than 1,500 analogs of active compounds yielded several classes of {$\Delta$}F508-CFTR correctors (aminoarylthiazoles, quinazolinylaminopyrimidinones, and bisaminomethylbithiazoles) with micromolar potency that produced greater apical membrane chloride current than did low-temperature rescue. Correction was seen within 3-6 hours and persisted for more than 12 hours after washout. Functional correction was correlated with plasma membrane expression of complex-glycosylated {$\Delta$}F508-CFTR protein. Biochemical studies suggested a mechanism of action involving improved {$\Delta$}F508-CFTR folding at the ER and stability at the cell surface. The bisaminomethylbithiazoles corrected {$\Delta$}F508-CFTR in {$\Delta$}F508/{$\Delta$}F508 human bronchial epithelia but did not correct a different temperature-sensitive CFTR mutant (P574H-CFTR) or a dopamine receptor mutant.

Screening of 150,000 chemically diverse compounds and more than 1,500 analogs of active compounds yielded several classes of {$\Delta$}F508-CFTR correctors (aminoarylthiazoles, quinazolinylaminopyrimidinones, and bisaminomethylbithiazoles) with micromolar potency that produced greater apical membrane chloride current than did low-temperature rescue. Correction was seen within 3-6 hours and persisted for more than 12 hours after washout. Functional correction was correlated with plasma membrane expression of complex-glycosylated {$\Delta$}F508-CFTR protein. Biochemical studies suggested a mechanism of action involving improved {$\Delta$}F508-CFTR folding at the ER and stability at the cell surface. The bisaminomethylbithiazoles corrected {$\Delta$}F508-CFTR in {$\Delta$}F508/{$\Delta$}F508 human bronchial epithelia but did not correct a different temperature-sensitive CFTR mutant (P574H-CFTR) or a dopamine receptor mutant. Small-molecule correctors maybe useful in the treatment of CF caused by the {$\Delta$}F508 mutation.}

  abstract = {Deep eutectic solvents, considered ionic liquid (IL) analogues, show promise for many material science and engineering applications over typical ILs because they are readily available and relatively inexpensive. Atomistic molecular dynamics simulations have been performed over a range of temperatures on one eutectic mixture, 1:2 choline chloride/urea, using different force field modifications. Good agreement was achieved between simulated density, volume expansion coefficient, heat capacity, and diffusion coefficients and experimental values in order to validate the best performing force field. Atom-atom and center-of-mass radial distribution functions are discussed in order to understand the atomistic interactions involved in this eutectic mixture. Experimental infrared (IR) spectra are also reported for choline chloride-urea mixtures, and band assignments are discussed. The distribution of hydrogen-bond interactions from molecular simulations is correlated to curve-resolved bands from the IR spectra. This work suggests that there is a strong interaction between the NH2 of urea and the chlorine anion where the system wants to maximize the number of hydrogen bonds to the anion. Additionally, the disappearance of free carbonyl groups upon increasing concentrations of urea suggests that at low urea concentrations, urea will preferentially interact with the anion through the NH2 groups. As this concentration increases, the complex remains but with additional interactions that remove the free carbonyl band from the spectra. The results from both molecular simulations and experimental IR spectroscopy support the idea that key interactions between the moieties in the eutectic mixture interrupt the main interactions within the parent substances and are responsible for the decrease in freezing point. \textcopyright{} 2013 American Chemical Society.}

Transverse relaxation-optimized spectroscopy (TROSY) is an approach for suppression of transverse relaxation in multidimensional NMR experiments, which is based on constructive use of interference between DD coupling and CSA. For example, a TROSY-type two-dimensional 1H,15N-correlation experiment with a uniformly 15N-labeled protein in a DNA complex of molecular mass 17 kDa at a 1H frequency of 750 MHz showed that 15N relaxation during 15N chemical shift evolution and 1HN relaxation during signal acquisition both are significantly reduced by mutual compensation of the DD and CSA interactions. The reduction of the linewidths when compared with a conventional two-dimensional 1H,15N-correlation experiment was 60\% and 40\%, respectively, and the residual linewidths were 5 Hz for 15N and 15 Hz for 1HN at 4\textdegree C. Because the ratio of the DD and CSA relaxation rates is nearly independent of the molecular size, a similar percentagewise reduction of the overall transverse relaxation rates is expected for larger proteins. For a 15N-labeled protein of 150 kDa at 750 MHz and 20\textdegree C one predicts residual linewidths of 10 Hz for 15N and 45 Hz for 1HN, and for the corresponding uniformly 15N,2H-labeled protein the residual linewidths are predicted to be smaller than 5 Hz and 15 Hz, respectively. The TROSY principle should benefit a variety of multidimensional solution NMR experiments, especially with future use of yet somewhat higher polarizing magnetic fields than are presently available, and thus largely eliminate one of the key factors that limit work with larger molecules.},

We perform enhanced sampling molecular dynamics simulations to recover the free energy surfaces of a thermostable mutant of the GPCR serotonin receptor 5-HT2B in the unliganded form and bound to a lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) agonist and lisuride antagonist. LSD binding imparts a *110 kJ/mol driving force for conformational rearrangement into an active state. The lisuride-bound form is structurally similar to the apo form and only *24 kJ/mol more stable.

  abstract = {Traditionally, the dependence of enzyme activity on temperature has been described by a model consisting of two processes: the catalytic reaction defined by {$\Delta$}GDaggercat, and irreversible inactivation defined by {$\Delta$}GDaggerinact. However, such a model does not account for the observed temperature-dependent behaviour of enzymes, and a new model has been developed and validated. This model (the Equilibrium Model) describes a new mechanism by which enzymes lose activity at high temperatures, by including an inactive form of the enzyme (Einact) that is in reversible equilibrium with the active form (Eact); it is the inactive form that undergoes irreversible thermal inactivation to the thermally denatured state. This equilibrium is described by an equilibrium constant whose temperature-dependence is characterized in terms of the enthalpy of the equilibrium, {$\Delta$}Heq, and a new thermal parameter, Teq, which is the temperature at which the concentrations of Eact and Einact are equal; Teq may therefore be regarded as the thermal equivalent of Km. Characterization of an enzyme with respect to its temperature-dependent behaviour must therefore include a determination of these intrinsic properties. The Equilibrium Model has major implications for enzymology, biotechnology and understanding the evolution of enzymes. The present study presents a new direct data-fitting method based on fitting progress curves directly to the Equilibrium Model, and assesses the robustness of this procedure and the effect of assay data on the accurate determination of Teq and its associated parameters. It also describes simpler experimental methods for their determination than have been previously available, including those required for the application of the Equilibrium Model to non-ideal enzyme reactions.},

  abstract = {All-atom molecular dynamics simulations of the ion current through OmpF, the major porin in the outer membrane of Escherichia coli, were performed. Starting from the crystal structure, the all-atom modeling allows us to calculate a parameterfree ion conductance in semiquantitative agreement with experiment. Discrepancies between modeling and experiment occur, e.g., at salt concentrations above 1 M KCl or at high temperatures. At lower salt concentrations, the ions have separate pathways along the channel surface. The constriction zone in the channel contains, on one side, a series of positively charges (R42, R82, R132), and on the opposite side, two negatively charged residues (D113, E117). Mutations generated in the constriction zone by removing cationic residues enhance the otherwise small cation selectivity, whereas removing the anionic residues reverses the selectivity. Reduction of the negatively charged residues decreases the conductance by half, whereas cationic residues enhance the conductance. Experiments on mutants confirm the results of the molecular-level simulations.},

  abstract = {Amyloid aggregates are found in many neurodegenerative diseases, including Huntington's, Alzheimer's, and prion diseases. The precise role of the aggregates in disease progression has been difficult to elucidate because of the diversity of aggregated states they can adopt. Here, we study the formation of fibrils and oligomers by exon 1 of huntingtin protein. We show that the oligomer states are consistent with polymer micelles that are limited in size by the stretching entropy of the polyglutamine region. The model shows how the sequences flanking the amyloid core modulate aggregation behavior. The N17 region promotes aggregation through weakly attractive interactions, whereas the C38 tail opposes aggregation via steric repulsion. We also show that the energetics of cross-{$\beta$} stacking by polyglutamine would produce fibrils with many alignment defects, but minor perturbations from the flanking sequences are sufficient to reduce the defects to the level observed in experiment. We conclude with a discussion of the implications of this model for other amyloid-forming molecules.}

  abstract = {Equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations, in which proteins spontaneously and repeatedly fold and unfold, have recently been used to help elucidate the mechanistic principles that underlie the folding of fast-folding proteins. The extent to which the conclusions drawn from the analysis of such proteins, which fold on the microsecond timescale, apply to the millisecond or slower folding of naturally occurring proteins is, however, unclear. As a first attempt to address this outstanding issue, we examine here the folding of ubiquitin, a 76-residue-long protein found in all eukaryotes that is known experimentally to fold on a millisecond timescale. Ubiquitin folding has been the subject of many experimental studies, but its slow folding rate has made it difficult to observe and characterize the folding process through all-atom molecular dynamics simulations. Here we determine the mechanism, thermodynamics, and kinetics of ubiquitin folding through equilibrium atomistic simulations. The picture emerging from the simulations is in agreement with a view of ubiquitin folding suggested from previous experiments. Our findings related to the folding of ubiquitin are also consistent, for the most part, with the folding principles derived from the simulation of fast-folding proteins, suggesting that these principles may be applicable to a wider range of proteins.},

A previous report has shown that filamin A (FLNa), an actin-cross-linking and -scaffolding protein, interacts directly with the cytoplasmic N terminus of CFTR and that this interaction is necessary for stability and confinement of the channel to apical membranes. Here, we report that the CFTR N terminus has sequence similarity to known FLNa-binding partner-binding sites. FLNa has 24 Ig (IgFLNa) repeats, and a CFTR peptide pulled down repeats 9, 12, 17, 19, 21, and 23, which share sequence similarity yet differ from the other FLNa Ig domains. Using known structures of IgFLNa{$\cdot$}partner complexes as templates, we generated in silico models of IgFLNa{$\cdot$}CFTR peptide complexes. Point and deletion mutants of IgFLNa and CFTR informed by the models, including disease-causing mutations L15P and W19C, disrupted the binding interaction. The model predicted that a P5L CFTR mutation should not affect binding, but a synthetic P5L mutant peptide had reduced solubility, suggesting a different disease-causing mechanism. Taken together with the fact that FLNa dimers are elongated {\~(}160 nm) strands, whereas CFTR is compact (6-8 nm), we propose that a single FLNa molecule can scaffold multiple CFTR partners. Unlike previously defined dimeric FLNa{$\cdot$}partner complexes, the FLNa-monomeric CFTR interaction is relatively weak, presumptively facilitating dynamic clustering of CFTR at cell membranes. Finally, we show that deletion of all CFTR interacting domains from FLNa suppresses the surface expression of CFTR on baby hamster kidney cells.},

Yet, the reliability of these calculations can often be improved significantly if a number of precepts, or good practices, are followed. Although the theory upon which these good practices rely has largely been known for many years, it is often overlooked or simply ignored. In other cases, the theoretical developments are too recent for their potential to be fully grasped and merged into popular platforms for the computation of free-energy differences. In this contribution, the current best practices for carrying out free-energy calculations using free energy perturbation and nonequilibrium work methods are discussed, demonstrating that at little to no additional cost, free-energy estimates could be markedly improved and bounded by meaningful error estimates. Monitoring the probability distributions that underlie the transformation between the states of interest, performing the calculation bidirectionally, stratifying the reaction pathway, and choosing the most appropriate paradigms and algorithms for transforming between states offer significant gains in both accuracy and precision. \textcopyright{} 2010 American Chemical Society.}

The imprinted microspheres made with IL could obtain the good recognition ability to template protein, whereas the imprinted polymer synthesized in the absence of it had a similar adsorption capacity to the non-imprinted one. Furthermore, the preparation conditions of imprinted polymers (MIPs) including the content of IL, temperature of polymerization, and types of functional monomers and crosslinkers were systematically analyzed via circular dichroism spectrum and activity assay. The results illustrated that using hydroxyethyl acrylate as the functional monomer, ethylene glycol dimethacrylate as the crosslinker, 5 \% IL as the stabilizer, and 75\textdegree C as the reaction temperature could retain the structure of template protein as much as possible. The obtained MIPs showed excellent recognition ability to the template protein with the separation factor and selectivity factor value of 4.30 and 2.21, respectively. Consequently, it is an effective way to accurately imprint and separate template protein by cooperatively using circular dichroism spectroscopy and activity assay during the preparation of protein MIPs. The method of utilizing IL to stabilizing protein at high temperature would offer a good opportunity for various technologies to improve the development of macromolecules imprinting.},

Whereas mammalian glucose transporters (GLUTs) are specialists1, the hexose transporter from the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum PfHT12,3 has acquired the ability to transport both glucose and fructose sugars as efficiently as the dedicated glucose (GLUT3) and fructose (GLUT5) transporters. Here, to establish the molecular basis of sugar promiscuity in malaria parasites, we determined the crystal structure of PfHT1 in complex with d-glucose at a resolution of 3.6~\AA. We found that the sugar-binding site in PfHT1 is very similar to those of the distantly related GLUT3 and GLUT5 structures4,5. Nevertheless, engineered PfHT1 mutations made to match GLUT sugar-binding sites did not shift sugar preferences. The extracellular substrate-gating helix TM7b in PfHT1 was positioned in a fully occluded conformation, providing a unique glimpse into how sugar binding and gating are coupled. We determined that polar contacts between TM7b and TM1 (located about 15~\AA{} from d-glucose) are just as critical for transport as the residues that directly coordinate d-glucose, which demonstrates a strong allosteric coupling between sugar binding and gating. We conclude that PfHT1 has achieved substrate promiscuity not by modifying its sugar-binding site, but instead by evolving substrate-gating dynamics.},

They concern the limits of provability in formalaxiomatic theories. The first incompleteness theorem states that in anyconsistent formal system F within which a certain amount ofarithmetic can be carried out, there are statements of the language ofF which can neither be proved nor disproved in F.According to the second incompleteness theorem, such a formal systemcannot prove that the system itself is consistent (assuming it isindeed consistent). These results have had a great impact on thephilosophy of mathematics and logic. There have been attempts to applythe results also in other areas of philosophy such as the philosophy ofmind, but these attempted applications are more controversial. The present entry surveys the two incompleteness theorems and various issues surrounding them.

  abstract = {Comparisons were made among four categories of protein flexibility: (1) low-B-factor ordered regions, (2) high-B-factor ordered regions, (3) short disordered regions, and (4) long disordered regions. Amino acid compositions of the four categories were found to be significantly different from each other, with high-B-factor ordered and short disordered regions being the most similar pair. The high-B-factor (flexible) ordered regions are characterized by a higher average flexibility index, higher average hydrophilicity, higher average absolute net charge, and higher total charge than disordered regions. The low-B-factor regions are significantly enriched in hydrophobic residues and depleted in the total number of charged residues compared to the other three categories. We examined the predictability of the high-B-factor regions and developed a predictor that discriminates between regions of low and high B-factors. This predictor achieved an accuracy of 70\% and a correlation of 0.43 with experimental data, outperforming the 64\% accuracy and 0.32 correlation of predictors based solely on flexibility indices. To further clarify the differences between short disordered regions and ordered regions, a predictor of short disordered regions was developed. Its relatively high accuracy of 81\% indicates considerable differences between ordered and disordered regions. The distinctive amino acid biases of high-B-factor ordered regions, short disordered regions, and long disordered regions indicate that the sequence determinants for these flexibility categories differ from one another, whereas the significantly-greater-than-chance predictability of these categories from sequence suggest that flexible ordered regions, short disorder, and long disorder are, to a significant degree, encoded at the primary structure level.},

Although general features of the structure of CFTR have been predicted from homology models, the conformational changes that result in channel opening and closing have yet to be resolved.

This method has been successfully applied in many different fields, ranging from chemistry to biophysics and ligand docking and from material science to crystal structure prediction. We present an important development that speeds up metadynamics calculations by orders of magnitude and renders the algorithm much more robust. We use multiple interacting simulations, walkers, for exploring and reconstructing the same free energy surface. Each walker contributes to the history-dependent potential that, in metadynamics, is an estimate of the free energy. We show that the error on the reconstructed free energy does not depend on the number of walkers, leading to a fully linear scaling algorithm even on inexpensive loosely coupled clusters of PCs. In addition, we show that the accuracy and stability of the method are much improved by combining it with a weighted histogram analysis. We check the validity of our new method on a realistic application.},

MD trajectories often require many gigabytes of memory/disk space, complicating Blender import. We present Pyrite, a Blender plugin that overcomes these limitations. Pyrite allows researchers to visualize MD simulations within Blender, with full access to Blender's cutting-edge rendering techniques.

  abstract = {The two NBDs (nucleotide-binding domains) of ABC (ATP-binding-cassette) proteins function in a complex to mediate ATPase activity and this activity has been linked to their regulated transport activity. A similar model has been proposed for CFTR (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator), the chloride channel defective in cystic fibrosis, wherein ATP binding and hydrolysis regulate the channel gate. Recently, it was shown that the individual NBDs isolated from CFTR primarily mediate adenylate kinase activity, raising the possibility that this activity may also contribute to gating of the CFTR channel. However, this present study shows that whereas the isolated NBDs exhibit adenylate kinase activity, the full-length purified and reconstituted CFTR protein functions as an ATPase, arguing that the enzymatic activity of the NBDs is dependent on their molecular context and appropriate domain-domain assembly. As expected, the disease-causing mutant bearing a mutation in the ABC signature motif, CFTR-G551D, exhibited a markedly reduced ATPase activity. Furthermore, mutation of the putative catalytic base in CFTR caused a reduction in ATPase activity, with the CFTR-E1371Q mutant supporting a low level of residual activity. Neither of these mutants exhibited detectable adenylate kinase activity. Together, these findings support the concept that the molecular mechanism of action of CFTR is dependent on ATP binding and hydrolysis, and that the structure of prokaryotic ABC ATPases provide a useful template for understanding their mechanism of action. \textcopyright{} The Authors.},

  abstract = {Here we propose the reweighted autoencoded variational Bayes for enhanced sampling (RAVE) method, a new iterative scheme that uses the deep learning framework of variational autoencoders to enhance sampling in molecular simulations. RAVE involves iterations between molecular simulations and deep learning in order to produce an increasingly accurate probability distribution along a low-dimensional latent space that captures the key features of the molecular simulation trajectory. Using the Kullback-Leibler divergence between this latent space distribution and the distribution of various trial reaction coordinates sampled from the molecular simulation, RAVE determines an optimum, yet nonetheless physically interpretable, reaction coordinate and optimum probability distribution. Both then directly serve as the biasing protocol for a new biased simulation, which is once again fed into the deep learning module with appropriate weights accounting for the bias, the procedure continuing until estimates of desirable thermodynamic observables are converged. Unlike recent methods using deep learning for enhanced sampling purposes, RAVE stands out in that (a) it naturally produces a physically interpretable reaction coordinate, (b) is independent of existing enhanced sampling protocols to enhance the fluctuations along the latent space identified via deep learning, and (c) it provides the ability to easily filter out spurious solutions learned by the deep learning procedure. The usefulness and reliability of RAVE is demonstrated by applying it to model potentials of increasing complexity, including computation of the binding free energy profile for a hydrophobic ligand\textendash substrate system in explicit water with dissociation time of more than 3 min, in computer time at least twenty times less than that needed for umbrella sampling or metadynamics.},

They have generally not been amenable to conventional structure-based drug design, however, because their intrinsic conformational variability has precluded an atomic-level understanding of their binding to small molecules. Here we present long-time-scale, atomic-level molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of monomeric {$\alpha$}-synuclein (an IDP whose aggregation is associated with Parkinson's disease) binding the small-molecule drug fasudil in which the observed protein\textendash ligand interactions were found to be in good agreement with previously reported NMR chemical shift data. In our simulations, fasudil, when bound, favored certain charge\textendash charge and {$\pi$}-stacking interactions near the C terminus of {$\alpha$}-synuclein but tended not to form these interactions simultaneously, rather breaking one of these interactions and forming another nearby (a mechanism we term dynamic shuttling). Further simulations with small molecules chosen to modify these interactions yielded binding affinities and key structural features of binding consistent with subsequent NMR experiments, suggesting the potential for MD-based strategies to facilitate the rational design of small molecules that bind with disordered proteins.},

It has been unclear, however, whether any physical model (force field) used in MD simulations accurately describes both folded and disordered proteins. Here, we select a benchmark set of 21 systems, including folded and disordered proteins, simulate these systems with six state-of-the-art force fields, and compare the results to over 9,000 available experimental data points. We find that none of the tested force fields simultaneously provided accurate descriptions of folded proteins, of the dimensions of disordered proteins, and of the secondary structure propensities of disordered proteins. Guided by simulation results on a subset of our benchmark, however, we modified parameters of one force field, achieving excellent agreement with experiment for disordered proteins, while maintaining state-of-the-art accuracy for folded proteins. The resulting force field, a99SB-disp, should thus greatly expand the range of biological systems amenable to MD simulation. A similar approach could be taken to improve other force fields.},

  abstract = {Biomolecular simulations are typically performed in an aqueous environment where the number of ions remains fixed for the duration of the simulation, generally with either a minimally neutralizing ion environment or a number of salt pairs intended to match the macroscopic salt concentration. In contrast, real biomolecules experience local ion environments where the salt concentration is dynamic and may differ from bulk. The degree of salt concentration variability and average deviation from the macroscopic concentration remains, as yet, unknown. Here, we describe the theory and implementation of a Monte Carlo osmostat that can be added to explicit solvent molecular dynamics or Monte Carlo simulations to sample from a semigrand canonical ensemble in which the number of salt pairs fluctuates dynamically during the simulation. The osmostat reproduce the correct equilibrium statistics for a simulation volume that can exchange ions with a large reservoir at a defined macroscopic salt concentration. To achieve useful Monte Carlo acceptance rates, the method makes use of nonequilibrium candidate Monte Carlo (NCMC) moves in which monovalent ions and water molecules are alchemically transmuted using short nonequilibrium trajectories, with a modified Metropolis-Hastings criterion ensuring correct equilibrium statistics for an {$\Delta\mu$}, N, p, T) ensemble. We demonstrate how typical protein (DHFR and the tyrosine kinase Src) and nucleic acid (Drew-Dickerson B-DNA dodecamer) systems exhibit salt concentration distributions that significantly differ from fixed-salt bulk simulations and display fluctuations that are on the same order of magnitude as the average.},

  abstract = {The goal of this review is to establish a broad and rigorous theoretical framework to describe ion permeation through biological channels. This framework is developed in the context of atomic models on the basis of the statistical mechanical projection-operator formalism of Mori and Zwanzig. The review is divided into two main parts. The first part introduces the fundamental concepts needed to construct a hierarchy of dynamical models at different level of approximation. In particular, the potential of mean force (PMF) as a configuration-dependent free energy is introduced, and its significance concerning equilibrium and non-equilibrium phenomena is discussed. In addition, fundamental aspects of membrane electrostatics, with a particular emphasis on the influence of the transmembrane potential, as well as important computational techniques for extracting essential information from all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are described and discussed. The first part of the review provides a theoretical formalism to `translate ' the information from the atomic structure into the familiar language of phenomenological models of ion permeation. The second part is aimed at reviewing and contrasting results obtained in recent computational studies of three very different channels : the gramicidin A (gA) channel, which is a narrow one-ion pore (at moderate concentration), the KcsA channel from Streptomyces lividans, which is a narrow multi-ion pore, and the outer membrane matrix porin F (OmpF) from Escherichia coli, which is a trimer of three b-barrel subunits each forming wide aqueous multi-ion pores. Comparison with experiments demonstrates that current computational models are approaching semi-quantitative accuracy and are able to provide significant insight into the microscopic mechanisms of ion conduction and selectivity. We conclude that all-atom MD with explicit water molecules can represent important structural features of complex biological channels accurately, including such features as the location of ion-binding sites along the permeation pathway. We finally discuss the broader issue of the validity of ion permeation models and an outlook to the future.},

It is shown that a simulation with a constant external electric field applied in the direction normal to the membrane is equivalent to the influence of surrounding infinite baths maintained to a voltage difference via ion-exchanging electrodes connected to an electromotive force. It is also shown that the linearly-weighted displacement charge within the simulation system tracks the net flow of charge through the external circuit comprising the electromotive force and the electrodes. Using a statistical mechanical reduction of the degrees of freedom of the external system, three distinct theoretical routes are formulated and examined for the purpose of characterizing the free energy of a protein embedded in a membrane that is submitted to a voltage difference. The W-route is constructed from the variations in the voltage-dependent potential of mean force along a reaction path connecting two conformations of the protein. The Q-route is based on the average displacement charge as a function of the conformation of the protein. Finally, the G-route considers the relative charging free energy of specific residues, with and without applied membrane potentials. The theoretical formulation is illustrated with a simple model of an ion crossing a vacuum slab surrounded by two aqueous bulk phases and with a fragment of the voltage-sensor of the KvAP potassium channel. \textcopyright{} 2008 by the Biophysical Society.}

The nontoxic and biocompatible nature of ILs makes them a suitable substance for the storage and application of biomolecules. In this regard, the aqueous IL solutions have attracted a large number of studies to comprehend the role of water in modulating various properties of biomolecules. Here, we review some of the recent studies on aqueous ILs that concern the role of water in altering the behavior of ILs in general and in case of biomolecules solvated in ILs. The different structural and dynamic effects caused by water have been highlighted. We discuss the different modes of IL interaction that are responsible for stabilization and destabilization of proteins and enzymes followed by examples of water effect on this. The role of water in the case of nucleic acid storage in ILs, an area which has mostly been underrated, also has been emphasized. Our discussions highlight the fact that the effects of water on IL behavior are not general and are highly dependent on the nature of the IL under consideration. Overall, we aim to draw attention to the significance of water dynamics in the aqueous IL solutions, a better understanding of which can help in developing superior storage materials for application purposes.},

In contrast to other tools, the rule-based PLIP algorithm does not require any structure preparation. It returns a list of detected interactions on single atom level, covering seven interaction types (hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic contacts, pi-stacking, pi-cation interactions, salt bridges, water bridges and halogen bonds). PLIP stands out by offering publication-ready images, PyMOL session files to generate custom images and parsable result files to facilitate successive data processing. The full python source code is available for download on thewebsite. PLIP's command-line mode allows for high-throughput interaction profiling.},

  abstract = {We describe a comparative protein modelling method designed to find the most probable structure for a sequence given its alignment with related structures. The three-dimensional (3D) model is obtained by optimally satisfying spatial restraints derived from the alignment and expressed as probability density functions (pdfs) for the features restrained. For example, the probabilities for main-chain conformations of a modelled residue may be restrained by its residue type, main-chain conformation of an equivalent residue in a related protein, and the local similarity between the two sequences. Several such pdfs are obtained from the correlations between structural features in 17 families of homologous proteins which have been aligned on the basis of their 3D structures. The pdfs restrain C{$\alpha$}-C{$\alpha$} distances, main-chain N-O distances, main-chain and side-chain dihedral angles. A smoothing procedure is used in the derivation of these relationships to minimize the problem of a sparse database. The 3D model of a protein is obtained by optimization of the molecular pdf such that the model violates the input restraints as little as possible. The molecular pdf is derived as a combination of pdfs restraining individual spatial features of the whole molecule. The optimization procedure is a variable target function method that applies the conjugate gradients algorithm to positions of all non-hydrogen atoms. The method is automated and is illustrated by the modelling of trypsin from two other serine proteinases. \textcopyright{} 1993 Academic Press Limited.},

Ensuring though that these two criteria are met may not always be simple. Here we build on the fact that the times of escape from a long-lived metastable state obey Poisson statistics. This allows us to identify quantitative measures of trustworthiness of our calculation. We test our method on a few paradigmatic examples. \textcopyright{} 2014 American Chemical Society.},

  abstract = {High cost and high energy penalty for CO2uptake from flue gases are important obstacles in large-scale industrial applications, and developing efficient technology for CO2capture from technical and economic points is crucial. Ionic liquids (ILs) show the potential for CO2separation owing to their inherent advantages, and have been proposed as alternatives to overcome the drawbacks of conventional sorbents. Chemical modification of ILs to improve their performance in CO2absorption has received more attention. Deep eutectic solvents (DESs) as a new generation of ILs are considered as more economical alternatives to cope with the deficiencies of high cost and high viscosity of conventional ILs. This Review discusses the potential of functionalized ILs and DESs as CO2sorbents. Incorporation of CO2-philic functional groups, such as amine, in cation and/or anion moiety of ILs can promot their absorption capacity. In general, the functionalization of the anion part of ILs is more effective than the cation part. DESs represent favorable solvent properties and are capable of capturing CO2, but the research work is scarce and undeveloped compared to the studies conducted on ILs. It is possible to develop novel DESs with promising absorption capacity. However, more investigation needs to be carried out on the mechanism of CO2sorption of DESs to clarify how these novel sorbents can be adjusted and fine-tuned to be best tailored as optimized media for CO2capture.},

  abstract = {High cost and high energy penalty for CO2uptake from flue gases are important obstacles in large-scale industrial applications, and developing efficient technology for CO2capture from technical and economic points is crucial. Ionic liquids (ILs) show the potential for CO2separation owing to their inherent advantages, and have been proposed as alternatives to overcome the drawbacks of conventional sorbents. Chemical modification of ILs to improve their performance in CO2absorption has received more attention. Deep eutectic solvents (DESs) as a new generation of ILs are considered as more economical alternatives to cope with the deficiencies of high cost and high viscosity of conventional ILs. This Review discusses the potential of functionalized ILs and DESs as CO2sorbents. Incorporation of CO2-philic functional groups, such as amine, in cation and/or anion moiety of ILs can promot their absorption capacity. In general, the functionalization of the anion part of ILs is more effective than the cation part. DESs represent favorable solvent properties and are capable of capturing CO2, but the research work is scarce and undeveloped compared to the studies conducted on ILs. It is possible to develop novel DESs with promising absorption capacity. However, more investigation needs to be carried out on the mechanism of CO2sorption of DESs to clarify how these novel sorbents can be adjusted and fine-tuned to be best tailored as optimized media for CO2capture.},

  abstract = {Although protein based therapeutics is the fastest growing sector of the pharmaceutical industry, production costs remain incredibly high and rapid commercialization of new protein drug candidates are not being fully realized due to the presence of many barriers, namely the physical and chemical instabilities of proteins. Of these degradation pathways, protein aggregation is arguably the most common and troubling manifestation of protein instability, occurring in almost all phases of development. Protein aggregates are usually nonnative in structure, may exhibit reduced biological activity, and can remain soluble and/or precipitate from solution. In addition to reducing efficacy, if administered to a patient, aggregates can cause adverse reactions, such as immune response, sensitization, or even anaphylactic shock. Therefore, if even a small amount of aggregates form during formulation or storage, a product can be rendered unacceptable. Moreover, for the practical application of traditional and novel drug delivery techniques, protein based therapeutics must be formulated at relatively high concentrations and must remain stable for extended periods of time. The structural differences among various proteins are so significant, that the application of a universal stabilization strategy has not yet been successful, though the effects of common excipients are generally universal. The current approach toward stabilizing protein drugs against aggregation is by trial-and-error testing of different combinations of cosolutes (e.g. salts, sugars, surfactants, amino acids, etc.) using empirically derived heuristics. While ubiquitously used, this approach is inefficient and does not always enable the discovery of stable protein solution formulations. In response to this major problem, we have developed and tested a new class of excipients that has the potential for wide spread application as a universal stabilizer of protein therapeutics. When compared to other commonly used excipients, our novel excipients offer more than an order of magnitude improvement at suppressing the aggregation of a model protein. As a result, if used in formulations, the shelf life of a protein drug, at room or refrigerated temperatures, may be extended from a few weeks to several months or years. Furthermore, these excipients will likely be useful during production and purification for improving yield and lowering downstream purification costs.}

  abstract = {The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) anion channel is essential to maintain fluid homeostasis in key organs such as the lungs or the digestive systems. Functional impairment of CFTR due to mutation in the cftr gene lead to Cystic Fibrosis (CF) the most common lethal genetic disorder. Here we observe that the first nucleotide-binding domain (NBD1) of CFTR can spontaneously adopt an alternative conformation that departs from the canonical NBD fold previously observed for CFTR and other ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter proteins. Crystallography studies reveal that this conformation involves a topological reorganization of the {$\beta$}-subdomain of NBD1. This alternative state is adopted by wild-type CFTR in cells, where it leads to enhanced channel activity. Single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer microscopy shows that the equilibrium between the conformations is regulated by ATP binding. However, under destabilizing conditions, such as a the prominent disease-causing mutation F508el , this conformational flexibility enables unfolding of the {$\beta$}-subdomain. Our data indicate that in wild-type CFTR switching to this topologically-swapped conformation of NBD1 regulates channel function, but, in the presence of the F508del mutation, it allows domain misfolding and subsequent protein degradation. Our work provides a framework to design conformation-specific therapeutics to prevent noxious transitions.}

  abstract = {Time-lagged independent component analysis (tICA) is a widely used dimension reduction method for the analysis of molecular dynamics (MD) trajectories and has proven particularly useful for the construction of protein dynamics Markov models. It identifies those ``slow'' collective degrees of freedom onto which the projections of a given trajectory show maximal autocorrelation for a given lag time. Here we ask how much information on the actual protein dynamics and, in particular, the free energy landscape that governs these dynamics the tICA-projections of MD-trajectories contain, as opposed to noise due to the inherently stochastic nature of each trajectory. To answer this question, we have analyzed the tICA-projections of high dimensional random walks using a combination of analytical and numerical methods. We find that the projections resemble cosine functions and strongly depend on the lag time, exhibiting strikingly complex behavior. In particular, and contrary to previous studies of principal component projections, the projections change noncontinuously with increasing lag time. The tICA-projections of selected 1 {$\mu$}s protein trajectories and those of random walks are strikingly similar, particularly for larger proteins, suggesting that these trajectories contain only little information on the energy landscape that governs the actual protein dynamics. Further the tICA-projections of random walks show clusters very similar to those observed for the protein trajectories, suggesting that clusters in the tICA-projections of protein trajectories do not necessarily reflect local minima in the free energy landscape. We also conclude that, in addition to the previous finding that certain ensemble properties of nonconverged protein trajectories resemble those of random walks; this is also true for their time correlations.},

According to the 'extrathermodynamic' TATB hypothesis, such ions have identical free energies of transfer from water to any solvent. We find that this is not the case, because S- interacts better than S+ with water (by about 20 kcal mol-1), while S+ is better solvated by acetonitrile (by about 2 kcal mol-1) and chloroform (about 8 kcal mol-1) solvents. The importance of 'long-range' electrostatic interactions on the charge discrimination by solvent is demonstrated by the comparison of standard vs corrected methods to calculate: (i) the electrostatic potential at the centre of the solute; (ii) the interaction energies between the ions and the solvents; and (iii) the free energies of charging the neutral sphere S0 to S+ and S-, respectively. These conclusions are obtained with several solvent models and simulation conditions. The question of ion pairing for the S+S-, S+Cl- and S-Na+ pairs is also examined in the three solvents. Finally, simulations at a liquid-liquid water-chloroform interface represented explicitly, show that S+ and S- are highly surface active, although they do not possess, like classical surfactants, an amphiphilic topology. Adsorption at the interface is found with different methodologies and at different ion concentrations. These results are important in the context of the 'TATB hypothesis', and for our understanding of solvation of large hydrophobic ions in pure liquids or in heterogeneous liquid environments.

  abstract = {The infrared (IR) spectra of polypeptides are dominated by the so-called amide bands. Because they originate from the strongly polar and polarizable amide groups (AGs) making up the backbone, their spectral positions sensitively depend on the local electric fields. Aiming at accurate computations of these IR spectra by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, which derive atomic forces from a hybrid quantum and molecular mechanics (QM/MM) Hamiltonian, here we consider the effects of solvation in bulk liquid water on the amide bands of the AG model compound N-methyl-acetamide (NMA). As QM approach to NMA we choose grid-based density functional theory (DFT). For the surrounding MM water, we develop, largely based on computations, a polarizable molecular mechanics (PMM) model potential called GP6P, which features six Gaussian electrostatic sources (one induced dipole, five static partial charge distributions) and, therefore, avoids spurious distortions of the DFT electron density in hybrid DFT/PMM simulations. Bulk liquid GP6P is shown to have favorable properties at the thermodynamic conditions of the parameterization and beyond. Lennard-Jones (LJ) parameters of the DFT fragment NMA are optimized by comparing radial distribution functions in the surrounding GP6P liquid with reference data obtained from a "first-principles" DFT-MD simulation. Finally, IR spectra of NMA in GP6P water are calculated from extended DFT/PMM-MD trajectories, in which the NMA is treated by three different DFT functionals (BP, BLYP, B3LYP).

  abstract = {The infrared (IR) spectra of polypeptides are dominated by the so-called amide bands. Because they originate from the strongly polar and polarizable amide groups (AGs) making up the backbone, their spectral positions sensitively depend on the local electric fields. Aiming at accurate computations of these IR spectra by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, which derive atomic forces from a hybrid quantum and molecular mechanics (QM/MM) Hamiltonian, here we consider the effects of solvation in bulk liquid water on the amide bands of the AG model compound N-methyl-acetamide (NMA). As QM approach to NMA we choose grid-based density functional theory (DFT). For the surrounding MM water, we develop, largely based on computations, a polarizable molecular mechanics (PMM) model potential called GP6P, which features six Gaussian electrostatic sources (one induced dipole, five static partial charge distributions) and, therefore, avoids spurious distortions of the DFT electron density in hybrid DFT/PMM simulations. Bulk liquid GP6P is shown to have favorable properties at the thermodynamic conditions of the parameterization and beyond. Lennard-Jones (LJ) parameters of the DFT fragment NMA are optimized by comparing radial distribution functions in the surrounding GP6P liquid with reference data obtained from a "first-principles" DFT-MD simulation. Finally, IR spectra of NMA in GP6P water are calculated from extended DFT/PMM-MD trajectories, in which the NMA is treated by three different DFT functionals (BP, BLYP, B3LYP). Method-specific frequency scaling factors are derived from DFT-MD simulations of isolated NMA. The DFT/PMM-MD simulations with GP6P and with the optimized LJ parameters then excellently predict the effects of aqueous solvation and deuteration observed in the IR spectra of NMA. As a result, the methods required to accurately compute such spectra by DFT/PMM-MD also for larger peptides in aqueous solution are now at hand.}

Chinese hamster ovary cell lines stably expressing wild-type CFTR or mutant G970R-CFTR yielded polypeptides with apparent masses of 170 kDa as the major products, whereas the major products of mutants S945L-CFTR and H949Y-CFTR had apparent masses of 150 kDa.

Increased levels of mature CFTR (170 kDa) could be obtained for mutant H949Y when cells were grown at a lower temperature (26 \textdegree C) or incubated in the presence of 10\% glycerol. For all mutants, the open probability (P0) of the CFTR channels was significantly altered. S945L-CFTR and G970R-CFTR showed a severe reduction in the P0, whereas the H949Y mutation doubled the P0 relative to wild-type. The changes in P0 predominantly resulted from an alteration of the mean burst durations which suggests that CL3 is involved in obtaining and/or maintaining stability of the open state. In addition, mutants S945L and G970R had current-voltage relationships that were not completely linear over the range {$\pm$}80 mV, but showed slight outward rectification. The fact that CL3 mutations can have subtle effects on channel conductance indicates that this region may be physically close to the inner mouth of the pore.}

  abstract = {Two views about mathematics: nominalism and platonism In ontological discussions about mathematics, two views are prominent. According to platonism, mathematical objects (as well as mathematical relations and structures) exist and are abstract; that is, they are not located in space and time and have no causal connection with us. Although this characterization of abstract objects is purely negative\textemdash indicating what such objects are not\textemdash in the context of mathematics it captures the crucial features the objects in questions are supposed to have. According to nominalism, mathematical objects (including, henceforth, mathematical relations and structures) do not exist, or at least they need not be taken to exist for us to make sense of mathematics. So, it is the nominalist's burden to show how to interpret mathematics without the commitment to the existence of mathematical objects. This is, in fact, a key feature of nominalism: those who defend the view need to show that it is possible to yield at least as much explanatory work as the platonist obtains, but invoking a meager ontology. To achieve that, nominalists in the philosophy of mathematics forge interconnections with metaphysics (whether mathematical objects do exist), epistemology (what kind of knowledge of these entities we have), and philosophy of science (how to make sense of the successful application of mathematics in science without being committed to the existence of mathematical entities). These interconnections are one of the sources of the variety of nominalist views.},

Most mutant nascent chains do not pass quality control in the ER, and those that do remain thermally unstable, only partially functional, and are rapidly endocytosed and degraded. Although the lack of the Phe-508 peptide backbone diminishes the NBD1 folding yield, the absence of the aromatic side chain is primarily responsible for defective CFTR assembly and channel gating.

Here we present a 3D structure of CFTR, constructed by molecular modeling and supported biochemically, in which Phe-508 mediates a tertiary interaction between the surface of NBD1 and a cytoplasmic loop (CL4) in the C-terminal membrane-spanning domain (MSD2). This crucial cytoplasmic membrane interface, which is dynamically involved in regulation of channel gating, explains the known sensitivity of CFTR assembly to many disease-associated mutations in CL4 as well as NBD1 and provides a sharply focused target for small molecules to treat CF.

The results presented herein provide valuable information on aqueous Reline solutions both in terms of experimental data and molecular insights, which in turn, we believe, might assist in developing further applications of Reline and other related DESs. \textcopyright{} the Partner Organisations 2014.}

Messages and the corresponding signals are points in two "function spaces," and the modulation process is a mapping of one space into the other. Using this representation, a number of results in communication theory are deduced concerning expansion and compression of bandwidth and the threshold effect. Formulas are found for the maxmum rate of transmission of binary digits over a system when the signal is perturbed by various types of noise. Some of the properties of "ideal" systems which transmit at this maxmum rate are discussed. The equivalent number of binary digits per second for certain information sources is calculated.},

The hyperemia-ischemia cuff test resulted in considerable reduction in flow velocities in both posterior cerebral arteries. We attributed his slowness to chronic vertebrobasilar ischemia and surgical revascularization was performed. His symptoms subsided immediately after surgery. The improved perfusion in the posterior circulation was demonstrated on technetium-99 hexamethylpropyleneamine oxime single photon-emission CT.

  abstract = {THE cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is a phosphorylation-regulated Cl- channel located in the apical membrane of epithelia1-10. Although cystic fibrosis (CF) is caused by mutations in a single gene encoding CFTR11,12, the disease has a variable clinical phenotype13,14. The most common mutation associated with cystic fibrosis, deletion of a phenylalanine at position 508 (frequency, 67\%), is associated with severe disease15-17. But some missense mutations, for example ones in which arginine is replaced by histidine at residue at 117 (R117H; 0.8\%), tryptophan at 334 (0.4\%), or proline at 347 (0.5\%), are associated with milder disease15,17,18. These missense mutations affect basic residues located at the external end of the second (M2) and in the sixth (M6) putative membrane-spanning sequences. Here we report that, when expressed in heterologous epithelial cells, all three mutants were correctly processed and generated cyclic AMP-regulated apical Cl- currents. Although the macroscopic current properties were normal, the amount of current was reduced. Patch-clamp analysis revealed that all three mutants had reduced single-channel conductances. In addition, R117H showed altered sensitivity to external pH and had altered single-channel kinetics. These results explain the quantitative decrease in macroscopic Cl- current, and suggest that R117, R334 and R347 contribute to the pore of the CFTR Cl - channel. Our results also suggest why R117H, R334W and R347P produce less severe clinical disease and have implications for our understanding of cystic fibrosis. \textcopyright{} 1993 Nature Publishing Group.}

While further calculations are necessary to fully validate the force field, initial results suggest the AMOEBA polarizable multipole force field is able to describe the structure and energetics of peptides and proteins, in both gas-phase and solution environments.},

We generated the starting input files and single configuration potential energies for the host-guest in the SAMPL5 blind prediction challenge for the GROMACS, AMBER, LAMMPS, DESMOND and CHARMM molecular simulation programs. All conversions were fully automated from the originally prepared AMBER input files using a combination of the ParmEd and InterMol conversion programs. We find that the energy calculations for all molecular dynamics engines for this molecular set agree to better than 0.1~\% relative absolute energy for all energy components, and in most cases an order of magnitude better, when reasonable choices are made for different cutoff parameters. However, there are some surprising sources of statistically significant differences. Most importantly, different choices of Coulomb's constant between programs are one of the largest sources of discrepancies in energies. We discuss the measures required to get good agreement in the energies for equivalent starting configurations between the simulation programs, and the energy differences that occur when simulations are run with program-specific default simulation parameter values. Finally, we discuss what was required to automate this conversion and comparison.},

The search for CF therapies acting by modulating the impaired function of mutant CFTR will be greatly advanced by high resolution structures of CFTR in different states. To date, two medium resolution electron microscopy (EM) structures of CFTR are available (one of a distant zebrafish (Danio rerio) CFTR ortholog and one of human CFTR). The two models are nearly identical to one another, and both correspond to the inward-facing, nucleotide binding domains (NBDs) separated, closed state of the channel. In addition, lower resolution structural data are available for human CFTR in an alternative conformation which likely features associated NBDs and thus geometrically resembles the conducting state of the channel. Multiple homology models of human CFTR in multiple states have been developed over the years, yet their correspondence to the existing structural information is unexplored. In this work we use molecular dynamics flexible fitting (MDFF) simulations to refine two previously described CFTR models based on the available cryo-EM map of the human protein. This map was recorded in the absence of ATP and consequently represents closed-state CFTR yet its features likely correspond to an NBD associated conformation of the protein. Accordingly, the resulting models feature dimerized NBDs yet with no membrane traversing pore. Moreover, the open probability of the new models as deduced from the MDFF trajectories is significantly lower than that deduced from control MD trajectories initiated from the starting models. We propose that the new models correspond to a CFTR conformation which to date was largely unexplored yet is one that is relevant to the gating cycle of the protein. In particular this conformation may participate in rapid channel opening and closing through small allosteric movements controlled by nucleotide binding and dissociation events. Analyzing the resulting trajectories (and not only the final models as is usually the case), we demonstrate that the refined models have good stereochemical properties and are also in favorable agreement with multiple experimental data. Moreover, despite different starting points, the final models share many common features.

  abstract = {Mutations in the chloride channel cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR) cause cystic fibrosis, a genetic disorder characterized by defects in CFTR biosynthesis, localization to the cell surface, or activation by regulatory factors. It was discovered recently that surface localization of CFTR is stabilized by an interaction between the CFTR N terminus and the multidomain cytoskeletal protein filamin. The details of the CFTR-filamin interaction, however, are unclear. Using x-ray crystallography, we show how the CFTR N terminus binds to immunoglobulin-like repeat 21 of filamin A (FlnA-Ig21). CFTR binds to {$\beta$}-strands C and D of FlnA-Ig21 using backbone-backbone hydrogen bonds, a linchpin serine residue, and hydrophobic side-chain packing. We use NMR to determine that the CFTR N terminus also binds to several other immunoglobulin-like repeats from filamin A in vitro. Our structural data explain why the cystic fibrosis-causing S13F mutation disrupts CFTR-filamin interaction. We show that FlnA-Ig repeats transfected into cultured Calu-3 cells disrupt CFTR-filamin interaction and reduce surface levels of CFTR. Our findings suggest that filamin A stabilizes surface CFTR by anchoring it to the actin cytoskeleton through interactions with multiple filamin Ig repeats. Such an interaction mode may allow filamins to cluster multiple CFTR molecules and to promote colocalization of CFTR and other filamin-binding proteins in the apical plasma membrane of epithelial cells.},

In this work, we have performed comparative molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of BODIPY-PC in DPPC (dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine) monolayers and bilayers at three surface pressures (3, 10, and 40 mN/m) to explore (1) the microscopic correspondence between monolayer and bilayer structures, (2) the fluorophore's position within the membrane, and (3) the microscopic driving forces governing the fluorophore's tilting. The MD simulations reveal very close agreement between the monolayer and bilayer systems in terms of the fluorophore's orientation and lipid chain order, suggesting that monolayer experiments can be used to approximate bilayer systems. The simulations capture the trend of reduced tilt angle of the fluorophore with increasing surface pressure, as seen in the experimental results, and provide detailed insights into fluorophore location and orientation, not obtainable in the experiments. The simulations also reveal that the enthalpic contribution is dominant at 40 mN/m, resulting in smaller tilt angles of the fluorophore, and the entropy contribution is dominant at lower pressures, resulting in larger tilt angles.},

The results of physical tests agreed well with the result of optical microscopy, which showed that treatment at the medium pressure reduction rate resulted in minimum changes in the spaces between the cell membrane and cell wall, water loss, relative electrical conductivity, color and micromechanical properties. Experimental results showed that the pressure reduction rate had obvious effects on the cell membrane integrity of vacuum-treated onion epidermis. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS This work tested the effect extent of different pressure rates on the cell membrane integrity during vacuum treatment, which has been demonstrated to provide many benefits to the food processing industry.

  abstract = {In CFTR, the chloride ion channel mutated in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients, pore opening is coupled to ATP-binding-induced dimerization of two cytosolic nucleotide binding domains (NBDs) and closure to dimer disruption following ATP hydrolysis. CFTR opening rate, unusually slow because of its high-energy transition state, is further slowed by CF mutation {$\Delta$}F508. Here, we exploit equilibrium gating of hydrolysis-deficient CFTR mutant D1370N and apply rate-equilibrium free-energy relationship analysis to estimate relative timing of opening movements in distinct protein regions. We find clear directionality of motion along the longitudinal protein axis and identify an opening transition-state structure with the NBD dimer formed but the pore still closed. Thus, strain at the NBD/pore-domain interface, the {$\Delta$}F508 mutation locus, underlies the energetic barrier for opening. Our findings suggest a therapeutic opportunity to stabilize this transition-state structure pharmacologically in {$\Delta$}F508-CFTR to correct its opening defect, an essential step toward restoring CFTR function.}

The E1 first binds the UBL and catalyzes adenylation of the UBL's C-terminus, prior to promoting UBL transfer to a downstream E2. Ubiquitin's Arg 72, which corresponds to Ala72 in the UBL NEDD8, is a key E1 selectivity determinant: swapping ubiquitin and NEDD8 residue 72 identity was shown previously to swap their E1 specificity. Correspondingly, Arg190 in the UBA3 subunit of NEDD8's heterodimeric E1 (the APPBP1-UBA3 complex), which corresponds to a Gln in ubiquitin's E1 UBA1, is a key UBL selectivity determinant. Here, we dissect this specificity with biochemical and X-ray crystallographic analysis of APPBP1-UBA3-NEDD8 complexes in which NEDD8's residue 72 and UBA3's residue 190 are substituted with different combinations of Ala, Arg, or Gln. APPBP1-UBA3's preference for NEDD8's Ala72 appears to be indirect, due to proper positioning of UBA3's Arg190. By contrast, our data are consistent with direct positive interactions between ubiquitin's Arg72 and an E1's Gln. However, APPBP1-UBA3's failure to interact with a UBL having Arg72 is not due to a lack of this favorable interaction, but rather arises from UBA3's Arg 190 acting as a negative gate. Thus, parallel residues from different UBL pathways can utilize distinct mechanisms to dictate interaction selectivity, and specificity can be amplified by barriers that prevent binding to components of different conjugation cascades. \textcopyright{} 2008 American Chemical Society.}

  abstract = {We propose an approach that combines an extraction of collective motions of a molecular system with a sampling of its free energy surface. A recently introduced method of metadynamics allows exploration of the free energy surface of a molecular system by means of coarse-grained dynamics with flooding of free energy minima. This free energy surface is defined as a function of a set of collective variables (e.g., interatomic distances, angles, torsions, and others). In this study, essential coordinates determined by essential dynamics (principle component analysis) were used as collective variables in metadynamics. First, dynamics of the model system (explicitly solvated alanine dipeptide, Ace-Ala-Nme) was simulated by a classical molecular dynamics simulation. The trajectory (1 ns) was then analyzed by essential dynamics to obtain essential coordinates. The free energy surface as a function of the first and second essential coordinates was then explored by metadynamics. The resulting free energy surface is in agreement with other studies of this system. We propose that a combination of these two methods (metadynamics and essential dynamics) has great potential in studies of conformational changes in peptides and proteins. \textcopyright{} 2007 American Chemical Society.}

Here we use site-directed mutagenesis to identify arginine residues contributing important surface charges in the intracellular mouth of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) Cl- channel pore. While wild-type CFTR was associated with a linear current-voltage relationship with symmetrical solutions, strong outward rectification was observed after mutagenesis of two arginine residues (R303 and R352) located near the intracellular ends of the fifth and sixth transmembrane regions. Current rectification was dependent on the charge present at these positions, consistent with an electrostatic effect. Furthermore, mutagenesis-induced rectification was more pronounced at lower Cl- concentrations, suggesting that these mutants had a reduced ability to concentrate Cl- ions near the inner pore mouth. R303 and R352 mutants exhibited reduced single channel conductance, especially at negative membrane potentials, that was dependent on the charge of the amino acid residue present at these positions. However, the very low conductance of both R303E and R352E-CFTR could be greatly increased by elevating intracellular Cl- concentration. Modification of an introduced cysteine residue at position 303 by charged methanethiosulfonate reagents reproduced charge-dependent effects on current rectification. Mutagenesis of arginine residues in the second and tenth transmembrane regions also altered channel permeation properties, however these effects were not consistent with changes in channel surface charges.

The two NBDs of CFTR have been modelled as a heterodimer, stabilized by ATP binding at two sites in the NBD interface. It has been suggested that ATP hydrolysis occurs at only one of these sites as the putative catalytic base is only conserved in NBD2 of CFTR (Glu 1371), but not in NBD1 where the corresponding residue is a serine, Ser573. Previously, we showed that fragments of CFTR corresponding to NBD1 and NBD2 can be purified and co-reconstituted to form a heterodimer capable of ATPase activity. In the present study, we show that the two NBD fragments form a complex in vivo, supporting the utility of this model system to evaluate the role of Glu1371 in ATP binding and hydrolysis. The present studies revealed that a mutant NBD2 (E1371Q) retains wild-type nucleotide binding affinity of NBD2. On the other hand, this substitution abolished the ATPase activity formed by the co-purified complex. Interestingly, introduction of a glutamate residue in place of the non-conserved Ser 573 in NBD1 did not confer additional ATPase activity by the heterodimer, implicating a vital role for multiple residues in formation of the catalytic site. These findings provide the first biochemical evidence suggesting that the Walker B residue: Glu1371, plays a primary role in the ATPase activity conferred by the NBD1-NBD2 heterodimer. \textcopyright{} 2007 Biochemical Society.},

Pharmacological studies have identified both competitive and noncompetitive P-gp substrates, but neither the precise location of the substrate binding sites, nor the basis of competitive and noncompetitive interactions has been fully characterized. Here, potential of mean force (PMF) calculations are used to identify the transport-competent minimum free energy binding locations of five compounds, Hoechst 33342, Rhodamine 123, paclitaxel, tariquidar, and verapamil to P-gp. Unrestrained molecular dynamics simulations were also performed to confirm the substrates were stable in the energy wells determined using the PMF calculations. All compounds had energy minima within the P-gp transmembrane (TM) pore. For Hoechst 33342 and Rhodamine 123, a second minimum outside the TM pore was also identified. Based on this and previous studies of nicardipine and morphine [ Subramanian et al. J. Chem. Inf.

The insertion of urea molecules was found to change the density distribution of cations and anions around the given cations significantly, disrupting the long-range ordered structure of choline chloride. Moreover, with increasing urea concentration, the hydrogen bond interactions between choline cations and Cl- anions decreased, while those among urea molecules obviously increased. From the hydrogen bond lifetimes, it was found that a ratio of 1:2 between choline chloride and urea is necessary for a reasonable strength of hydrogen bond interaction to maintain the low melting point of the mixture of choline chloride with urea. In addition, it was also deduced from the interaction energies that a urea content of 67.7 \% may make the interactions of cation-anion, cation-urea and anion-urea modest, and thus results in the lower melting point of the eutectic mixture of choline chloride and urea. The present results may offer assistance to some extent for understanding the physicochemical properties of the eutectic mixture of choline chloride and urea, and give valuable information for the further development and application of deep eutectic solvents. \textcopyright{} 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

  abstract = {Metadynamics is an important enhanced sampling technique in molecular dynamics simulation to efficiently explore potential energy surfaces. The recently developed transition-tempered metadynamics (TTMetaD) has been proven to converge asymptotically without sacrificing exploration of the collective variable space in the early stages of simulations, unlike other convergent metadynamics (MetaD) methods. We have applied TTMetaD to study the permeation of drug-like molecules through a lipid bilayer to further investigate the usefulness of this method as applied to problems of relevance to medicinal chemistry. First, ethanol permeation through a lipid bilayer was studied to compare TTMetaD with nontempered metadynamics and well-tempered metadynamics. The bias energies computed from various metadynamics simulations were compared to the potential of mean force calculated from umbrella sampling. Though all of the MetaD simulations agree with one another asymptotically, TTMetaD is able to predict the most accurate and reliable estimate of the potential of mean force for permeation in the early stages of the simulations and is robust to the choice of required additional parameters. We also show that using multiple randomly initialized replicas allows convergence analysis and also provides an efficient means to converge the simulations in shorter wall times and, more unexpectedly, in shorter CPU times; splitting the CPU time between multiple replicas appears to lead to less overall error. After validating the method, we studied the permeation of a more complicated drug-like molecule, trimethoprim. Three sets of TTMetaD simulations with different choices of collective variables were carried out, and all converged within feasible simulation time. The minimum free energy paths showed that TTMetaD was able to predict almost identical permeation mechanisms in each case despite significantly different definitions of collective variables.},

While loss of HCO3- transport is highly relevant to cystic fibrosis, the relative importance of direct and indirect HCO3- transport it is currently unknown. Methods Patch clamp recordings from membrane patches excised from cells heterologously expressing wild type and mutant forms of human CFTR were used to isolate directly CFTR-mediated HCO3- transport and characterize its functional properties. Results The permeability of HCO3- was \textasciitilde 25\% that of Cl- and was invariable under all ionic conditions studied. CFTR-mediated HCO3- currents were inhibited by open channel blockers DNDS, glibenclamide and suramin, and these inhibitions were affected by mutations within the channel pore. Cystic fibrosis mutations previously associated with disrupted cellular HCO3- transport did not affect direct HCO3- permeability. Conclusions Cl- and HCO3- share a common transport pathway in CFTR, and selectivity between Cl- and HCO3- is independent of ionic conditions. The mechanism of transport is therefore effectively identical for both ions. We suggest that mutations in CFTR that cause cystic fibrosis by selectively disrupting HCO3- transport do not impair direct CFTR-mediated HCO3- transport, but may predominantly alter CFTR regulation of other HCO3- transport pathways.},

Advanced analytical techniques currently used for characterization of protein aggregates are prone to a number of limitations and usually require additional manipulations with the sample, such as dilution, separation, labeling, and use of special cuvettes. In the present work, we compared conventional techniques for the analysis of protein aggregates with a novel approach that employs the water proton transverse relaxation rate R2(1H2O). We explored differences in the sensitivity of conventional techniques, size-exclusion chromatography (SEC), microflow imaging (MFI), and dynamic light scattering (DLS), and water NMR (wNMR) toward the presence of monoclonal antibody aggregates generated by different stresses. We demonstrate that wNMR outperformed SEC, DLS, and MFI in that it was most consistently sensitive to increases in both soluble and insoluble aggregates, including subvisible particles. The simplicity of wNMR, its sensitivity, and possibility of noninvasive measurements are unique advantages that would permit its application for more efficient and higher throughput optimization of protein formulations.}

Insoluble cytoplasmic aggregates isolated from the brain of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal lobar degeneration patients contain ubiquitinated, hyperphosphorylated, and N-terminally truncated TDP-43. Truncated fragments of TDP-43 identified from patient tissues contain part of the second RNA recognition motif (RRM2) and the disordered C-terminus, indicating that both domains can be involved in aggregation and toxicity. Here, we focus on RRM2. Using all-atom replica-averaged metadynamics simulations with NMR chemical shift restraints, we characterized the atomic structure of non-native states of RRM2, sparsely populated under native conditions. These structures reveal the exposure to the solvent of aggregation-prone peptide regions, normally buried in the native state, supporting a role in aggregation for the partially folded states of RRM2.},

  abstract = {The power of structural information for informing biological mechanism is clear for stable folded macromolecules, but similar structure-function insight is more difficult to obtain for highly dynamic systems such as intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) which must be described as structural ensembles. Here we present IDPConformerGenerator, a flexible, modular open source software platform for generating large and diverse ensembles of disordered protein states that builds conformers that obey geometric, steric and other physical restraints on the input sequence. IDPConformerGenerator samples backbone phi ({$\varphi$}), psi ({$\psi$}), and omega ({$\omega$}) torsion angles of relevant sequence fragments from loops and secondary structure elements extracted from folded protein structures in the RCSB Protein Data Bank, and builds side chains from robust Monte Carlo algorithms using expanded rotamer libraries. IDPConformerGenerator has many user-defined options enabling variable fractional sampling of secondary structures, supports Bayesian models for assessing agreement of IDP ensembles for consistency with experimental data, and introduces a machine learning approach to transform between internal to Cartesian coordinates with reduced error. IDPConformerGenerator will facilitate the characterization of disordered proteins to ultimately provide structural insights into these states that have key biological functions.},

Syntaxins, the prototype family of SNARE proteins, have a carboxy-terminal tail-anchor and multiple coiled-coil domains. There are 15 members of the syntaxin family in the human genome and 7 syntaxin-like genes in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In conjunction with other SNAREs and with the cytoplasmic NSF and SNAP proteins, syntaxins mediate vesicle fusion in diverse vesicular transport processes along the exocytic and the endocytic pathway. They are crucial components that both drive and provide specificity to the myriad vesicular fusion processes that characterize the eukaryotic cell.}

However, the processes by which CFTR is regulated on the cell surface are not clear. Here we report the identification of a protein-protein interaction between CFTR and the cytoskeletal filamin proteins. Using proteomic approaches, we identified filamins as proteins that associate with the extreme CFTR N terminus. Furthermore, we identified a disease-causing missense mutation in CFTR, serine 13 to phenylalanine (S13F), which disrupted this interaction. In cells, filamins tethered plasma membrane CFTR to the underlying actin network. This interaction stabilized CFTR at the cell surface and regulated the plasma membrane dynamics and confinement of the channel. In the absence of filamin binding, CFTR was internalized from the cell surface, where it prematurely accumulated in lysosomes and was ultimately degraded. Our data demonstrate what we believe to be a previously unrecognized role for the CFTR N terminus in the regulation of the plasma membrane stability and metabolic stability of CFTR.

In this article, we describe significant updates that we have made over the last two years to the resource. The number of sequences in UniProtKB has risen to approximately 190 million, despite continued work to reduce sequence redundancy at the proteome level. We have adopted new methods of assessing proteome completeness and quality. We continue to extract detailed annotations from the literature to add to reviewed entries and supplement these in unreviewed entries with annotations provided by automated systems such as the newly implemented Association-Rule-Based Annotator (ARBA). We have developed a credit-based publication submission interface to allow the community to contribute publications and annotations to UniProt entries. We describe how UniProtKB responded to the COVID-19 pandemic through expert curation of relevant entries that were rapidly made available to the research community through a dedicated portal.

  abstract = {Based on the crystal structure of the cross-{$\beta$} spine formed by the peptide NNQQNY, we have developed a computational approach for identifying those segments of amyloidogenic proteins that themselves can form amyloid-like fibrils. The approach builds on experiments showing that hexapeptides are sufficient for forming amyloid-like fibrils. Each six-residue peptide of a protein of interest is mapped onto an ensemble of templates, or 3D profile, generated from the crystal structure of the peptide NNQQNY by small displacements of one of the two intermeshed {$\beta$}-sheets relative to the other. The energy of each mapping of a sequence to the profile is evaluated by using ROSETTADESIGN, and the lowest energy match for a given peptide to the template library is taken as the putative prediction. If the energy of the putative prediction is lower than a threshold value, a prediction of fibril formation is made. This method can reach an accuracy of {$\approx$}80\% with a P value of {$\approx$}10 -12 when a conservative energy threshold is used to separate peptides that form fibrils from those that do not. We see enrichment for positive predictions in a set of fibril-forming segments of amyloid proteins, and we illustrate the method with applications to proteins of interest in amyloid research. \textcopyright{} 2006 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.},

  abstract = {Based on the crystal structure of the cross-{$\beta$} spine formed by the peptide NNQQNY, we have developed a computational approach for identifying those segments of amyloidogenic proteins that themselves can form amyloid-like fibrils. The approach builds on experiments showing that hexapeptides are sufficient for forming amyloid-like fibrils. Each six-residue peptide of a protein of interest is mapped onto an ensemble of templates, or 3D profile, generated from the crystal structure of the peptide NNQQNY by small displacements of one of the two intermeshed {$\beta$}-sheets relative to the other. The energy of each mapping of a sequence to the profile is evaluated by using ROSETTADESIGN, and the lowest energy match for a given peptide to the template library is taken as the putative prediction. If the energy of the putative prediction is lower than a threshold value, a prediction of fibril formation is made. This method can reach an accuracy of {$\approx$}80\% with a P value of {$\approx$}10 -12 when a conservative energy threshold is used to separate peptides that form fibrils from those that do not. We see enrichment for positive predictions in a set of fibril-forming segments of amyloid proteins, and we illustrate the method with applications to proteins of interest in amyloid research. \textcopyright{} 2006 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.},

Cryo-electron tomograms provide the cell geometry and ribosome distributions. Time-dependent behaviors of concentrations and reaction fluxes from stochastic-deterministic simulations over a cell cycle reveal how the cell balances demands of its metabolism, genetic information processes, and growth, and offer insight into the principles of life for this minimal cell. The energy economy of each process including active transport of amino acids, nucleosides, and ions is analyzed. WCM reveals how emergent imbalances lead to slowdowns in the rates of transcription and translation. Integration of experimental data is critical in building a kinetic model from which emerges a genome-wide distribution of mRNA half-lives, multiple DNA replication events that can be compared to qPCR results, and the experimentally observed doubling behavior.},

  abstract = {Metadynamics is a commonly used and successful enhanced sampling method. By the introduction of a history dependent bias which depends on a restricted number of collective variables it can explore complex free energy surfaces characterized by several metastable states separated by large free energy barriers. Here we extend its scope by introducing a simple yet powerful method for calculating the rates of transition between different metastable states. The method does not rely on a previous knowledge of the transition states or reaction coordinates, as long as collective variables are known that can distinguish between the various stable minima in free energy space. We demonstrate that our method recovers the correct escape rates out of these stable states and also preserves the correct sequence of state-to-state transitions, with minimal extra computational effort needed over ordinary metadynamics. We apply the formalism to three different problems and in each case find excellent agreement with the results of long unbiased molecular dynamics runs.},

MLN4924 is a neddylation inhibitor currently under investigation in multiple phase I studies on various malignancies, and its clincal name is Pevonedistat. It has been documented that MLN4924 blocks Cullins neddylation and inactivates CRLs and, in turn, triggers cell-cycle arrest, apoptosis, senescence and autophagy in many cancer cells. In this study, we investigated the anti-tumor effect of MLN4924 in human clear cell renal carcinoma (ccRCC). Levels of both Nedd8 activating enzyme E1 and Nedd8-conjugating enzyme E2 were higher in ccRCC tissues and RCC cancer cells than in normal. Moreover, MLN4924 treatment led to rapid inhibition of Cullin1 neddylation and notably suppressed growth and survival as well as migration in a dose-and time-dependent manner. Mechanistic studies revealed that MLN4924 induced the accumulation of a number of CRL substrates, including p21, p27 and Wee1 to trigger DNA damage and induce growth arrest at the G2/M phase. MLN4924 also induced anti-migration and anti-invasion by activating E-cadherin and repressing Vimentin. Taken together, this study provides the first evidence that neddylation pathway is overactive in ccRCC and that MLN4924 induces dose-dependent anti-proliferation, anti-migration, anti-invasion in ccRCC cells. The study thus indicates that MLN4924 has potential therapeutic value for the clinical treatment of renal cancer.},

The aim of this in vitro study was to evaluate the effect of ivacaftor on mutant CFTR protein forms with defects in protein processing and/or channel function. Methods: The effect of ivacaftor on CFTR function was tested in electrophysiological studies using a panel of Fischer rat thyroid (FRT) cells expressing 54 missense CFTR mutations that cause defects in the amount or function of CFTR at the cell surface. Results: Ivacaftor potentiated multiple mutant CFTR protein forms that produce functional CFTR at the cell surface.

In the present article, an extension of the CHARMM force field to drug-like molecules is presented. The resulting CHARMM General Force Field (CGenFF) covers a wide range of chemical groups present in biomolecules and drug-like molecules, including a large number of heterocyclic scaffolds. The parametrization philosophy behind the force field focuses on quality at the expense of transferability, with the implementation concentrating on an extensible force field. Statistics related to the quality of the parametrization with a focus on experimental validation are presented. Additionally, the parametrization procedure, described fully in the present article in the context of the model systems, pyrrolidine, and 3-phenoxymethylpyrrolidine will allow users to readily extend the force field to chemical groups that are not explicitly covered in the force field as well as add functional groups to and link together molecules already available in the force field. CGenFF thus makes it possible to perform "all-CHARMM" simulations on drug-target interactions thereby extending the utility of CHARMM force fields to medicinally relevant systems.},

  abstract = {AutoDock Tools allows the analysis of docking files and is used to represent clustering conformations, yet it analyses only one docking file at a time and the method applied to represent the clustering complicates the visualization of clustering conformations. The creation of a plugin called PyDRA for the molecular visualizer PyMOL resolves that problem and allows to simultaneously process more than one docking file for the two types of file format from AutoDock 4.2 and Vina 1.1 (dlg and pdbqt). Moreover, this plugin facilitates the visualization of conformations through two clustering methods. The first method is a K-RMSD algorithm, which is based on the clustering through RMSD and enables the interactive visualization groups through a treemap. And the other one is based on a hierarchical clustering algorithm, using an algorithm of average distances which generates a dendrogram that offers the possibility to explore sequentially the groups that illustrate best the docking. The results obtained with the visualization methods implemented showed that the treemap, due to the implemented colour bar, facilitates to identify the clusters that have a greater affinity to the protein at a glance, and to determine which of the clusters hold a greater number of elements, on the other hand, the dendrogram shows a detailed analyses of the hierarchical clustering, which also enables the user to distinguish the clustering regardless the size of the window, as well as to differentiate each cluster and conformation in order to gain insight of docking results of Autdock and Vina. The fact that both visualizations are connected to PyMOL increases its ability of discernment.},

The method is demonstrated to be highly accurate for simple bulk fluids, liquid/liquid and liquid/vapor interfaces, and lipid bilayers and monolayers. Values for rC (the cutoff distance for direct evaluation of pairs) and RC (the local region radius) equal to 10 \AA{} and twice the longest edge of the periodic cell, respectively, provide excellent efficiency and accuracy. Dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC) monolayers simulated with the CHARMM (Chemistry at HARvard Molecular Mechanics) C27r lipid parameter set and 3D-IPS/DFFT yield surface tensions approximately 8 dyn/cm higher than those simulated using particle mesh Ewald (PME), and with experiment. In contrast, surface tensions for DMPC bilayers are 16 dyn/cm/leaflet with both 3D-IPS/DFFT (rC = 10 and 12 \AA ) and PME (rC = 12 \AA ). This indicates that PME (rC = 12 \AA ) may be used for simulations of bilayers, but not monolayers, and that the large bilayer surface tension arising from C27r is incorrect.},

  abstract = {The majority of cystic fibrosis (CF)-causing mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) lead to the misfolding, mistrafficking, and degradation of the mutant protein. Inhibition of degradation does not effectively increase the amount of trafficking competent CFTR, but typically leads to increased ER retention of misfolded forms. Thus, the initial off pathway steps occur early in the processing of the protein. To identify proteins that interact with these early forms of CFTR, in vitro crosslink experiments identified cotranslational partners of the nascent chain of the severe misfolded mutant, G85E CFTR. The mutant preferentially interacts with a subunit of an N-alpha-acetyltransferase A. Based on recent reports that acetylation of the N-termini of some N-end rule substrates control their ubiquitination and subsequent degradation, a potential role for this modification in regulation of CFTR expression was assessed. Knockdown experiments identified two complexes, which affect G85E CFTR proteins levels, NatA and NatB. Effects of the knockdowns on mRNA levels, translation rates, and degradation rates established that the two complexes regulate G85E CFTR through two separate mechanisms. NatA acts indirectly by regulating transcription levels and NatB acts through a previously identified, but incompletely understood posttranslational mechanism. This regulation did not effect trafficking of G85E CFTR, which remains retained in the ER, nor did it alter the degradation rate of CFTR. A mutation predicted to inhibit N-terminal acetylation of CFTR, Q2P, was without effect, suggesting neither system acts directly on CFTR. These results contradict the prediction that N-terminal acetylation of CFTR determines its fitness as a proteasome substrate, but rather NatB plays a role in the conformational maturation of CFTR in the ER through actions on an unidentified protein.}

  abstract = {Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) describes a physical phenomenon widely applied in biomedical research to estimate separations between biological molecules. Routinely, genetic engineering is used to incorporate spectral variants of the green fluorescent protein (GFPs), into cellular expressed proteins. The transfer efficiency or rate of energy transfer between donor and acceptor FPs is then assayed. As appreciable FRET occurs only when donors and acceptors are in close proximity (1-10nm), the presence of FRET may indicate that the engineered proteins associate as interacting species. For a homogeneous population of FRET pairs the separations between FRET donors and acceptors can be estimated from a measured FRET efficiency if it is assumed that donors and acceptors are randomly oriented and rotate extensively during their excited state (dynamic regime). Unlike typical organic fluorophores, the rotational correlation-times of FPs are typically much longer than their fluorescence lifetime; accordingly FPs are virtually static during their excited state. Thus, estimating separations between FP FRET pairs is problematic. To overcome this obstacle, we present here a simple method for estimating separations between FPs using the experimentally measured average FRET efficiency. This approach assumes that donor and acceptor fluorophores are randomly oriented, but do not rotate during their excited state (static regime). This approach utilizes a Monte-Carlo simulation generated look-up table that allows one to estimate the separation, normalized to the Fo rster distance, from the average FRET efficiency. Assuming a dynamic regime overestimates the separation significantly (by 10\% near 0.5 and 30\% near 0.75 efficiencies) compared to assuming a static regime, which is more appropriate for estimates of separations between FPs.},

These breakthroughs illustrate how DESs can fulfill multiple roles in directing chemistry at the nanoscale: acting as supramolecular template, metal/carbon source, sacrificial agent (e.g., ammonia release from urea), and/or redox agent, all in the absence of formal stabilizing ligand (here, solvent and stabilizer are one and the same).The ability to tailor the physicochemical properties of DESs is central to controlling their interfacial behavior.

This study examined whether that efficacy can be translated into effectiveness in routine clinical practice. METHOD: Seventy-eight adult women with bulimic disorders (bulimia nervosa and atypical bulimia nervosa) undertook individual CBT, with few exclusion criteria and a treatment protocol based on evidence-based approaches, utilizing individualized formulations. Patients completed measures of eating behaviors, eating attitudes, and depression pre- and post-treatment. Eight patients dropped out. The mean number of sessions attended was 19.2. RESULTS: No pretreatment features predicted drop-out. Treatment outcome was similar whether using treatment completer or intent to treat analyses. Approximately 50\% of patients were in remission by the end of treatment. There were significant improvements in mood, eating attitudes, and eating behaviors. Reductions in bingeing and vomiting were comparable to efficacy trials. DISCUSSION: The improvements in this "real-world" trial of CBT for adults with bulimic disorders mirrored those from large, funded research trials, though the conclusions that can be reached are inevitably limited by the nature of the trial (e.g., lack of control group and therapy validation).},

  abstract = {Alzheimer disease (AD) is the most common type of dementia, and is currently incurable; existing treatments for AD produce only a modest amelioration of symptoms. Research into this disease has conventionally focused on the CNS. However, several peripheral and systemic abnormalities are now understood to be linked to AD, and our understanding of how these alterations contribute to AD is becoming more clearly defined. This Review focuses on amyloid-{$\beta$} (A{$\beta$}), a major hallmark of AD. We review emerging findings of associations between systemic abnormalities and A{$\beta$} metabolism, and describe how these associations might interact with or reflect on the central pathways of A{$\beta$} production and clearance. On the basis of these findings, we propose that these abnormal systemic changes might not only develop secondary to brain dysfunction but might also affect AD progression, suggesting that the interactions between the brain and the periphery have a crucial role in the development and progression of AD. Such a systemic view of the molecular pathogenesis of AD could provide a novel perspective for understanding this disease and present new opportunities for its early diagnosis and treatment.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Many disease-causing mutations impair protein stability. Here, we explore a thermodynamic strategy to correct the disease-causing F508del mutation in the human cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (hCFTR). F508del destabilizes nucleotide-binding domain 1 (hNBD1) in hCFTR relative to an aggregation-prone intermediate. We developed a fluorescence self-quenching assay for compounds that prevent aggregation of hNBD1 by stabilizing its native conformation. Unexpectedly, we found that dTTP and nucleotide analogs with exocyclic methyl groups bind to hNBD1 more strongly than ATP and preserve electrophysiological function of full-length F508del-hCFTR channels at temperatures up to 37 \textdegree C. Furthermore, nucleotides that increase open-channel probability, which reflects stabilization of an interdomain interface to hNBD1, thermally protect full-length F508del-hCFTR even when they do not stabilize isolated hNBD1. Therefore, stabilization of hNBD1 itself or of one of its interdomain interfaces by a small molecule indirectly offsets the destabilizing effect of the F508del mutation on full-length hCFTR. These results indicate that high-affinity binding of a small molecule to a remote site can correct a disease-causing mutation. We propose that the strategies described here should be applicable to identifying small molecules to help manage other human diseases caused by mutations that destabilize native protein conformation.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {The accumulation of intracellular {$\beta$}-amyloid peptide (A{$\beta$}) is important pathological characteristic of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the exact underlying molecular mechanism remains to be elucidated. Here, we reported that Nuclear Paraspeckle Assembly Transcript 1 (NEAT1), a long n on-coding RNA, exhibits repressed expression in the early stage of AD and its down-regulation declines neuroglial cell mediating A{$\beta$} clearance via inhibiting expression of endocytosis-related genes. We find that NEAT1 is associated with P300/CBP complex and its inhibition affects H3K27 acetylation (H3K27Ac) and H3K27 crotonylation (H3K27Cro) located nearby to the transcription start site of many genes, including endocytosis-related genes. Interestingly, NEAT1 inhibition down-regulates H3K27Ac but up-regulates H3K27Cro through repression of acetyl-CoA generation. NEAT1 also mediates the binding between STAT3 and H3K27Ac but not H3K27Cro. Therefore, the decrease of H3K27Ac and/or the increase of H3K27Cro declines expression of multiple related genes. Collectively, this study first reveals the different roles of H3K27Ac and H3K27Cro in regulation of gene expression and provides the insight of the epigenetic regulatory mechanism of NEAT1 in gene expression and AD pathology.},

Here, we use macropatch recording and Ussing chamber approaches to demonstrate that G551D impacts on phosphorylation-dependent activation of CFTR, and PKA-mediated phosphorylation regulates the interaction between the x-loop in nucleotide-binding domain 2 (NBD2) and cytosolic loop (CL) 1. We show that G551D not only disrupts ATP-dependent channel opening but also impairs phosphorylation-dependent channel activation by largely reducing PKA sensitivity consistent with the reciprocal relationship between channel opening/gating, ligand binding, and phosphorylation. Furthermore, we identified two novel GOF mutations: D1341R in the x-loop near the ATP-binding cassette signature motif in NBD2 and D173R in CL1, each of which strongly increased PKA sensitivity both in the wild-type (WT) background and when introduced into G551D-CFTR. When D1341R was combined with a second GOF mutation (e.g., K978C in CL3), we find that the double GOF mutation maximally increased G551D channel activity such that VX-770 had no further effect. We further show that a double chargereversal mutation of D1341R/D173R-CFTR exhibited similar PKA sensitivity when compared with WT-CFTR. Together, our results suggest that charge repulsion between D173 and D1341 of WT-CFTR normally inhibits channel activation at low PKA activity by reducing PKA sensitivity, and negative allostery by the G551D is coupled to reduced PKA sensitivity of CFTR that can be restored by second GOF mutations.},

  abstract = {The ability to make sense of the massive amounts of high-dimensional data generated from molecular dynamics simulations is heavily dependent on the knowledge of a low-dimensional manifold (parameterized by a reaction coordinate or RC) that typically distinguishes between relevant metastable states, and which captures the relevant slow dynamics of interest. Methods based on machine learning and artificial intelligence have been proposed over the years to deal with learning such low-dimensional manifolds, but they are often criticized for a disconnect from more traditional and physically interpretable approaches. To deal with such concerns, in this work we propose a deep learning based state predictive information bottleneck approach to learn the RC from high-dimensional molecular simulation trajectories. We demonstrate analytically and numerically how the RC learnt in this approach is connected to the committor in chemical physics and can be used to accurately identify transition states. A crucial hyperparameter in this approach is the time delay or how far into the future the algorithm should make predictions about. Through careful comparisons for benchmark systems, we demonstrate that this hyperparameter choice gives useful control over how coarse-grained we want the metastable state classification of the system to be. We thus believe that this work represents a step forward in systematic application of deep learning based ideas to molecular simulations.},

  abstract = {Alzheimer disease (AD) is the most common type of dementia, and is currently incurable; existing treatments for AD produce only a modest amelioration of symptoms. Research into this disease has conventionally focused on the CNS. However, several peripheral and systemic abnormalities are now understood to be linked to AD, and our understanding of how these alterations contribute to AD is becoming more clearly defined. This Review focuses on amyloid-{$\beta$} (A{$\beta$}), a major hallmark of AD. We review emerging findings of associations between systemic abnormalities and A{$\beta$} metabolism, and describe how these associations might interact with or reflect on the central pathways of A{$\beta$} production and clearance. On the basis of these findings, we propose that these abnormal systemic changes might not only develop secondary to brain dysfunction but might also affect AD progression, suggesting that the interactions between the brain and the periphery have a crucial role in the development and progression of AD. Such a systemic view of the molecular pathogenesis of AD could provide a novel perspective for understanding this disease and present new opportunities for its early diagnosis and treatment.},

  abstract = {A large number of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) are mediated by the interactions between proteins and peptide segments binding partners, and therefore determination of protein-peptide interactions (PpIs) is quite crucial to elucidate important biological processes and design peptides or peptidomimetic drugs that can modulate PPIs. Nowadays, as a powerful computation tool, molecular docking has been widely utilized to predict the binding structures of protein-peptide complexes. However, although a number of docking programs have been available, the systematic study on the assessment of their performance for PpIs has never been reported. In this study, a benchmark data set called PepSet consisting of 185 protein-peptide complexes with peptide length ranging from 5 to 20 residues was employed to evaluate the performance of 14 docking programs, including three protein-protein docking programs (ZDOCK, FRODOCK, and HawkDock), three small molecule docking programs (GOLD, Surflex-Dock, and AutoDock Vina), and eight protein-peptide docking programs (GalaxyPepDock, MDockPeP, HPEPDOCK, CABS-dock, pepATTRACT, DINC, AutoDock CrankPep (ADCP), and HADDOCK peptide docking). A new evaluation parameter, named IL\_RMSD, was proposed to measure the docking accuracy with fnat (the fraction of native contacts). In global docking, HPEPDOCK performs the best for the entire data set and yields the success rates of 4.3\%, 24.3\%, and 55.7\% at the top 1, 10, and 100 levels, respectively. In local docking, overall, ADCP achieves the best predictions and reaches the success rates of 11.9\%, 37.3\%, and 70.3\% at the top 1, 10, and 100 levels, respectively. It is expected that our work can provide some helpful insights into the selection and development of improved docking programs for PpIs.

  abstract = {A large number of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) are mediated by the interactions between proteins and peptide segments binding partners, and therefore determination of protein-peptide interactions (PpIs) is quite crucial to elucidate important biological processes and design peptides or peptidomimetic drugs that can modulate PPIs. Nowadays, as a powerful computation tool, molecular docking has been widely utilized to predict the binding structures of protein-peptide complexes. However, although a number of docking programs have been available, the systematic study on the assessment of their performance for PpIs has never been reported. In this study, a benchmark data set called PepSet consisting of 185 protein-peptide complexes with peptide length ranging from 5 to 20 residues was employed to evaluate the performance of 14 docking programs, including three protein-protein docking programs (ZDOCK, FRODOCK, and HawkDock), three small molecule docking programs (GOLD, Surflex-Dock, and AutoDock Vina), and eight protein-peptide docking programs (GalaxyPepDock, MDockPeP, HPEPDOCK, CABS-dock, pepATTRACT, DINC, AutoDock CrankPep (ADCP), and HADDOCK peptide docking). A new evaluation parameter, named IL\_RMSD, was proposed to measure the docking accuracy with fnat (the fraction of native contacts). In global docking, HPEPDOCK performs the best for the entire data set and yields the success rates of 4.3\%, 24.3\%, and 55.7\% at the top 1, 10, and 100 levels, respectively. In local docking, overall, ADCP achieves the best predictions and reaches the success rates of 11.9\%, 37.3\%, and 70.3\% at the top 1, 10, and 100 levels, respectively. It is expected that our work can provide some helpful insights into the selection and development of improved docking programs for PpIs. The benchmark data set is freely available at http://cadd.zju.edu.cn/pepset/.}

  abstract = {Disease modeling is increasingly being used to evaluate the effect of health intervention strategies, particularly for infectious diseases. However, the utility and application of such models are hampered by the inconsistent use of infectious disease modeling terms between and within disciplines. We sought to standardize the lexicon of infectious disease modeling terms and develop a glossary of terms commonly used in describing models' assumptions, parameters, variables, and outcomes. We combined a comprehensive literature review of relevant terms with an online forum discussion in a virtual community of practice, mod4PH (Modeling for Public Health). Using a convergent discussion process and consensus amongst the members of mod4PH, a glossary of terms was developed as an online resource. We anticipate that the glossary will improve inter- and intradisciplinary communication and will result in a greater uptake and understanding of disease modeling outcomes in heath policy decision-making. We highlight the role of the mod4PH community of practice and the methodologies used in this endeavor to link theory, policy, and practice in the public health domain.},

  abstract = {Cell membranes contain incredible diversity in the chemical structures of their individual lipid species and the ratios in which these lipids are combined to make membranes. Nevertheless, our current understanding of how each of these components affects the properties of the cell membrane remains elusive, in part due to the difficulties in studying the dynamics of membranes at high spatiotemporal resolution. In this work, we use coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations to investigate how individual lipid species contribute to the biophysical properties of the neuronal plasma membrane. We progress through eight membranes of increasing chemical complexity, ranging from a simple POPC/CHOL membrane to a previously published neuronal plasma membrane [Ing\'olfsson, H. I., et al. (2017) Biophys. J. 113 (10), 2271-2280] containing 49 distinct lipid species. Our results show how subtle chemical changes can affect the properties of the membrane and highlight the lipid species that give the neuronal plasma membrane its unique biophysical properties. This work has potential far-reaching implications for furthering our understanding of cell membranes.}

  abstract = {A significant challenge to making targeted CFTR modulator therapies accessible to all individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF) are many mutations in the CFTR gene that can cause CF, most of which remain uncharacterized. Here, we characterized the structural and functional defects of the rare CFTR mutation R352Q \textendash{} with potential role contributing to intrapore chloride ion permeation \textendash{} in patient-derived cell models of the airway and gut. CFTR function in differentiated nasal epithelial cultures and matched intestinal organoids was assessed using ion transport assay and forskolin-induced swelling (FIS) assay respectively. Two CFTR potentiators (VX-770, GLPG1837) and a corrector (VX-809) were tested. Data from R352Q-CFTR were compared to that of participants with mutations with known impact on CFTR function. R352Q-CFTR has residual CFTR function which was restored to functional CFTR activity by CFTR potentiators but not the corrector. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of R352Q-CFTR were carried out which indicated the presence of a chloride conductance defect, with little evidence supporting a gating defect. The combination approach of in vitro patient-derived cell models and in silico MD simulations to characterize rare CFTR mutations can improve the specificity and sensitivity of modulator response predictions and aid in their translational use for CF precision medicine. \#\#\# Competing Interest Statement SAW is the recipient of a Vertex Innovation Grant (2018) and a TSANZ/Vertex Research Award (2020).

Such calculations are of particular importance in protein-ligand free-energy calculations. To meet this challenge, we have developed new free-energy techniques that combine the advantages of the replica-exchange method with free-energy perturbation (FEP) and finite-difference thermodynamic integration (FDTI). These new techniques are tested and compared with FEP, FDTI, and the adaptive umbrella weighted histogram analysis method (AdUmWHAM) on the challenging calculation of the relative hydration free energy of methane and water. This calculation involves a large solvent configurational change. Through the use of replica-exchange moves along the {$\lambda$}-coordinate, the configurations sampled along {$\lambda$} are allowed to mix, which leads to dramatic improvements in solvent configurational sampling, an efficient reduction of random sampling error, and a reduction of general simulation error. This is achieved at effectively no extra computational cost, relative to standard FEP or FDTI.}

  abstract = {Ionic liquids (ILs) have proven effective solvents for pretreating lignocellulose, leading to the fast saccharification of cellulose and hemicellulose. However, the high cost of most ILs remains a major barrier to commercializing this recent approach at a practical scale. As a strategic detour, aqueous solutions of ILs are also being explored as less costly alternatives to neat ILs for cellulose pretreatment. However, limited studies on a few select IL systems are known and there remains no systematic survey of various ILs, eluding an in-depth understanding of pretreatment mechanisms afforded by aqueous IL systems. As a step toward filling this gap, this study presents results for Avicel cellulose pretreatment by neat and aqueous solutions (1.0 and 2.0 M) of 20 different ILs and three deep eutectic solvents, correlating enzymatic hydrolysis rates of pretreated cellulose with various IL properties such as hydrogen-bond basicity, polarity, Hofmeister ranking, and hydrophobicity. The pretreatment efficiencies of neat ILs may be loosely correlated to the hydrogen-bond basicity of the constituent anion and IL polarity; however, the pretreatment efficacies for aqueous ILs are more complicated and cannot be simply related to any single IL property. Several aqueous IL systems have been identified as effective alternatives to neat ILs in lignocellulose pretreatment. In particular, this study reveals that aqueous solutions of 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium methanesulfonate ([BMIM][MeSO 3]) are effective for pretreating switchgrass (Panicum virgatum), resulting in fast saccharification of both cellulose and hemicellulose.

  abstract = {Ionic liquids (ILs) have proven effective solvents for pretreating lignocellulose, leading to the fast saccharification of cellulose and hemicellulose. However, the high cost of most ILs remains a major barrier to commercializing this recent approach at a practical scale. As a strategic detour, aqueous solutions of ILs are also being explored as less costly alternatives to neat ILs for cellulose pretreatment. However, limited studies on a few select IL systems are known and there remains no systematic survey of various ILs, eluding an in-depth understanding of pretreatment mechanisms afforded by aqueous IL systems. As a step toward filling this gap, this study presents results for Avicel cellulose pretreatment by neat and aqueous solutions (1.0 and 2.0 M) of 20 different ILs and three deep eutectic solvents, correlating enzymatic hydrolysis rates of pretreated cellulose with various IL properties such as hydrogen-bond basicity, polarity, Hofmeister ranking, and hydrophobicity. The pretreatment efficiencies of neat ILs may be loosely correlated to the hydrogen-bond basicity of the constituent anion and IL polarity; however, the pretreatment efficacies for aqueous ILs are more complicated and cannot be simply related to any single IL property. Several aqueous IL systems have been identified as effective alternatives to neat ILs in lignocellulose pretreatment. In particular, this study reveals that aqueous solutions of 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium methanesulfonate ([BMIM][MeSO 3]) are effective for pretreating switchgrass (Panicum virgatum), resulting in fast saccharification of both cellulose and hemicellulose. An integrated analysis afforded by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, thermogravimetric analysis and cellulase adsorption isotherm of lignocellulose samples is further used to deliver a more complete view of the structural changes attending aqueous IL pretreatment. \textcopyright{} 2014 The Royal Society of Chemistry.}

MLN4924, a selective NAE inhibitor, has displayed preclinical anti-tumor activity in vitro and in vivo, and promising clinical activity has been reported in patients with refractory hematologic malignancies. Here, we sought to understand the mechanisms of resistance to MLN4924. K562 and U937 leukemia cells were exposed over a 6 month period to MLN4924 and populations of resistant cells (R-K562 MLN, R-U937MLN) were selected. R-K562MLN and R-U937MLN cells contain I310N and Y352H mutations in the NAE catalytic subunit UBA3, respectively. Biochemical analyses indicate that these mutations increase the enzyme's affinity for ATP while decreasing its affinity for NEDD8. These mutations effectively contribute to decreased MLN4924 potency in vitro while providing for sufficient NAE function for leukemia cell survival. Finally, R-K562MLN cells showed cross-resistance to other NAE-selective inhibitors, but remained sensitive to a pan-E1 (activating enzyme) inhibitor. Thus, our work provides insight into mechanisms of MLN4924 resistance to facilitate the development of more effective second-generation NAE inhibitors. \textcopyright{} 2014 Xu et al.},

Here we report a comprehensive study comparing effects of single and multiple NBD1 mutations on stability of both the NBD1 domain alone and on purified full length human CFTR. Single mutations S492P, A534P, I539T acted additively, and when combined with M470V, S495P, and R555K cumulatively yielded an NBD1 with highly improved structural stability. Strategic combinations of these mutations strongly stabilized the domain to attain a calorimetric Tm \textbackslash textgreater 70 \textdegree C. Replica exchange molecular dynamics simulations on the most stable 6SS-NBD1 variant implicated fluctuations, electrostatic interactions and side chain packing as potential contributors to improved stability. Progressive stabilization of NBD1 directly correlated with enhanced structural stability of full-length CFTR protein. Thermal unfolding of the stabilized CFTR mutants, monitored by changes in intrinsic fluorescence, demonstrated that Tm could be shifted as high as 67.4 \textdegree C in 6SS-CFTR, more than 20 \textdegree C higher than wild-type. H1402S, an NBD2 mutation, conferred CFTR with additional thermal stability, possibly by stabilizing an NBD-dimerized conformation. CFTR variants with NBD1-stabilizing mutations were expressed at the cell surface in mammalian cells, exhibited ATPase and channel activity, and retained these functions to higher temperatures. The capability to produce enzymatically active CFTR with improved structural stability amenable to biophysical and structural studies will advance mechanistic investigations and future cystic fibrosis drug development.},

However, further improvement in affinity and efficacy for these CFTR modulators will require insights into the molecular interactions between CFTR modulators and their binding targets. In this study, we use in silico molecular docking to identify potential binding sites for GLPG1837, a CFTR potentiator that may share a common mechanism and binding site with VX-770, the FDA-approved drug for patients carrying mutations with gating defects. Among the five binding sites predicted by docking, the two top-scoring sites are located at the interface between CFTR's two transmembrane domains: Site I consists of D924, N1138, and S1141, and site IIN includes F229, F236, Y304, F312, and F931. Using mutagenesis to probe the importance of these sites for GLPG187 binding, we find that disruption of predicted hydrogenbonding interactions by mutation of D924 decreases apparent affinity, while hydrophobic amino acids substitutions at N1138 and introduction of positively charged amino acids at S1141 improve the apparent affinity for GLPG1837. Alanine substitutions at Y304, F312, and F931 (site IIN) decrease the affinity for GLPG1837, whereas alanine substitutions at F229 and F236 (also site IIN), or at residues in the other three lower-scoring sites, have little effect. In addition, current relaxation analysis to assess the apparent dissociation rate of VX-770 yields results consistent with the dose-response experiments for GLPG8137, with the dissociation rate of VX-770 accelerated by D924N, F236A, Y304A, and F312A, but decelerated by N1138L and S1141K mutations. Collectively, these data identify two potential binding sites for GLPG1837 and VX-770 in CFTR.

In addition, current relaxation analysis to assess the apparent dissociation rate of VX-770 yields results consistent with the dose-response experiments for GLPG8137, with the dissociation rate of VX-770 accelerated by D924N, F236A, Y304A, and F312A, but decelerated by N1138L and S1141K mutations. Collectively, these data identify two potential binding sites for GLPG1837 and VX-770 in CFTR. We discuss the pros and cons of evidence for these two loci and the implications for future drug design.}

  abstract = {Ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluRs) are tetrameric ligand-gated ion channels that open their pores in response to binding of the agonist glutamate1\textendash 3. An ionic current through a single iGluR channel shows up to four discrete conductance levels (O1\textendash O4)4\textendash 6. Higher conductance levels have been associated with an increased number of agonist molecules bound to four individual ligand-binding domains (LBDs)6\textendash 10. Here we determine structures of a synaptic complex of AMPA-subtype iGluR and the auxiliary subunit {$\gamma$}2 in non-desensitizing conditions with various occupancy of the LBDs by glutamate. We show that glutamate binds to LBDs of subunits B and D only after it is already bound to at least the same number of LBDs that belong to subunits A and C. Our structures combined with single-channel recordings, molecular dynamics simulations and machine-learning analysis suggest that channel opening requires agonist binding to at least two LBDs. Conversely, agonist binding to all four LBDs does not guarantee maximal channel conductance and favours subconductance states O1 and O2, with O3 and O4 being rare and not captured structurally. The lack of subunit independence and low efficiency coupling of glutamate binding to channel opening underlie the gating of synaptic complexes to submaximal conductance levels, which provide a potential for upregulation of synaptic activity.},

Advances in structural biology, particularly the ``resolution revolution'' in cryo-EM, have led to breakthroughs in molecular characterization of TRPV channels. Structures with continuously improving resolution uncover atomic details of TRPV channel interactions with small molecules and protein-binding partners. Here, we provide a classification of structurally characterized binding sites in TRPV channels and discuss the progress that has been made by structural biology combined with mutagenesis, functional recordings, and molecular dynamics simulations toward understanding of the molecular mechanisms of ligand action. Given the similarity in structural architecture of TRP channels, 16 unique sites identified in TRPV channels may be shared between TRP channel subfamilies, although the chemical identity of a particular ligand will likely depend on the local amino-acid composition. The characterized binding sites and molecular mechanisms of ligand action create a diversity of druggable targets to aid in the design of new molecules for tuning TRP channel function in disease conditions.},

The key to folding of a biopolymer into a unique 3D structure or to an assembly of several biopolymers into a functional unit is a delicate balance between the attractive and repulsive forces that also makes such self-assembly reversible under physiological conditions. The all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) method has emerged as a powerful tool for studies of individual biomolecules and their functional assemblies, encompassing systems of ever increasing complexity. However, advances in parallel computing technology have outpaced the development of the underlying theoretical models - the molecular force fields, pushing the MD method into an untested territory. Recent tests of the MD method have found the most commonly used molecular force fields to be out of balance, overestimating attractive interactions between charged and hydrophobic groups, which can promote artificial aggregation in MD simulations of multi-component protein, nucleic acid, and lipid systems. One route towards improving the force fields is through the NBFIX corrections method, in which the intermolecular forces are calibrated against experimentally measured quantities such as osmotic pressure by making atom pair-specific adjustments to the non-bonded interactions. In this article, we review development of the NBFIX (Non-Bonded FIX) corrections to the AMBER and CHARMM force fields and discuss their implications for MD simulations of electrolyte solutions, dense DNA systems, Holliday junctions, protein folding, and lipid bilayer membranes.}

  abstract = {Changes in free energy provide valuable information for molecular recognition, including both ligand\textendash receptor binding thermodynamics and kinetics. Umbrella sampling (US), a widely used free energy calculation method, has long been used to explore the dissociation process of ligand\textendash receptor systems and compute binding free energy. In existing publications, the binding free energy computed from the potential of mean force (PMF) with US simulation mostly yielded ``ball park'' values with experimental data. However, the computed PMF values are highly influenced by factors such as initial conformations and/or trajectories provided, the reaction coordinate, and sampling of conformational space in each US window. These critical factors have rarely been carefully studied. Here we used US to study the guest aspirin and 1-butanol dissociation processes of {$\beta$}-cyclodextrin ({$\beta$}-CD) and an inhibitor SB2 dissociation from a p38{$\alpha$} mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) complex. For {$\beta$}-CD, we used three different {$\beta$}-CD conformations to generate the dissociation path with US windows. For p38{$\alpha$}, we generated the dissociation pathway by using accelerated molecular dynamics followed by conformational relaxing with short conventional MD, steered MD, and manual pulling. We found that, even for small {$\beta$}-CD complexes, different {$\beta$}-CD conformations altered the height of the PMF, but the pattern of PMF was not affected if the MD sampling in each US window was well-converged. Because changing the macrocyclic ring conformation needs to rotate dihedral angles in the ring, a bound ligand largely restrains the motion of cyclodextrin. Therefore, once a guest is in the binding site, cyclodextrin cannot freely change its initial conformation, resulting in different absolute heights of the PMF, which cannot be overcome by running excessively long MD simulations for each US window. Moreover, if the US simulations were not converged, the important barrier and minimum were missed. For ligand\textendash protein systems, our studies also suggest that the dissociation trajectories modeled by an enhanced sampling method must maintain a natural molecular movement to avoid biased PMF plots when using US simulations.},

  abstract = {Key points: Two functional abnormalities of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), a 25\% reduction of the single-channel conductance (g) and a {$\sim$}13-fold lower open probability (Po), were found with the R117H mutation that is associated with mild forms of cystic fibrosis. Characterizations of the gating defects of R117H-CFTR led to the conclusion that the mutation decreases Po by perturbing the gating conformational changes in CFTR's transmembrane domains (TMDs) without altering the function of the nucleotide binding domains (NBDs). Nonetheless, gating of the R117H-CFTR can be improved by a variety of pharmacological reagents supposedly acting on NBDs such as ATP analogues, or TMDs (e.g. VX-770 or nitrate). These reagents potentiate synergistically R117H-CFTR gating to a level that allows accurate assessments of its gating deficits. Our studies not only elucidate the mechanism underpinning gating dysfunction of R117H-CFTR, but also provide a mechanistic understanding of how VX-770 ameliorates the gating defects in the R117H mutant. Abstract: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is caused by loss-of-function mutations of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene encoding a phosphorylation-activated, but ATP-gated chloride channel. In the current study, we investigated the mechanism responsible for the gating defects manifested in R117H-CFTR, an arginine-to-histidine substitution at position 117 of CFTR that is associated with mild forms of CF. We confirmed previous findings of a 25\% decrease of the single-channel conductance (g) in R117H-CFTR, but found a {$\sim$}13-fold lower open probability (Po). This dramatic gating deficit is not due to dysfunctional nucleotide binding domains (NBDs) as the mutation does not alter the apparent affinity for ATP, and the mutant channels respond to ATP analogues in a similar manner as wild-type CFTR. Furthermore, once ATP hydrolysis is abolished, the R117H mutant can be trapped in a prolonged `burst opening' conformation that is proposed to be equipped with a stable NBD dimer. On the other hand, our results support the conclusion that the R117H mutation decreases Po by perturbing the gating conformational changes in CFTR's transmembrane domains as even when NBDs are kept at a dimerized configuration, Po is reduced by {$\sim$}10-fold.

The structure of the LH1-RC complex can provide information on the arrangement of protein subunits and cofactors; however, so far it has been resolved only at a relatively low resolution. Here we report the crystal structure of the calcium-ion-bound LH1-RC supercomplex of Thermochromatium tepidum at a resolution of 1.9\,\AA. This atomic-resolution structure revealed several new features about the organization of protein subunits and cofactors. We describe the loop regions of RC in their intact states, the interaction of these loop regions with the LH1 subunits, the exchange route for the bound quinone QB with free quinone molecules, the transport of free quinones between the inside and outside of the LH1 ring structure, and the detailed calcium-ion-binding environment. This structure provides a solid basis for the detailed examination of the light reactions that occur during bacterial photosynthesis.},

  abstract = {Key points: Two functional abnormalities of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), a 25\% reduction of the single-channel conductance (g) and a {$\sim$}13-fold lower open probability (Po), were found with the R117H mutation that is associated with mild forms of cystic fibrosis. Characterizations of the gating defects of R117H-CFTR led to the conclusion that the mutation decreases Po by perturbing the gating conformational changes in CFTR's transmembrane domains (TMDs) without altering the function of the nucleotide binding domains (NBDs). Nonetheless, gating of the R117H-CFTR can be improved by a variety of pharmacological reagents supposedly acting on NBDs such as ATP analogues, or TMDs (e.g. VX-770 or nitrate). These reagents potentiate synergistically R117H-CFTR gating to a level that allows accurate assessments of its gating deficits. Our studies not only elucidate the mechanism underpinning gating dysfunction of R117H-CFTR, but also provide a mechanistic understanding of how VX-770 ameliorates the gating defects in the R117H mutant. Abstract: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is caused by loss-of-function mutations of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene encoding a phosphorylation-activated, but ATP-gated chloride channel. In the current study, we investigated the mechanism responsible for the gating defects manifested in R117H-CFTR, an arginine-to-histidine substitution at position 117 of CFTR that is associated with mild forms of CF. We confirmed previous findings of a 25\% decrease of the single-channel conductance (g) in R117H-CFTR, but found a {$\sim$}13-fold lower open probability (Po). This dramatic gating deficit is not due to dysfunctional nucleotide binding domains (NBDs) as the mutation does not alter the apparent affinity for ATP, and the mutant channels respond to ATP analogues in a similar manner as wild-type CFTR. Furthermore, once ATP hydrolysis is abolished, the R117H mutant can be trapped in a prolonged `burst opening' conformation that is proposed to be equipped with a stable NBD dimer. On the other hand, our results support the conclusion that the R117H mutation decreases Po by perturbing the gating conformational changes in CFTR's transmembrane domains as even when NBDs are kept at a dimerized configuration, Po is reduced by {$\sim$}10-fold. Moreover, our data demonstrate that a synergistic improvement of R117H-CFTR function can be accomplished with a combined regiment of VX-770 (Ivacaftor), nitrate ion (NO3-) and N6-(2-phenylethyl)-2{${'}$}-deoxy-ATP (d-PATP), which almost completely rectifies the gating defect of R117H-CFTR.

Polarized epithelial cells have morphologically and functionally distinct apical and basolateral surfaces separated by tight junctions. The establishment and maintenance of these structures require delivery of membrane proteins and lipids to these domains. In this work, we have isolated a cDNA clone from a human intestinal cDNA library encoding a small GTPase, rab13, closely related to the yeast Sec4 protein. Confocal microscopy analysis on polarized Caco-2 cells shows that rab13 protein colocalized with the tight junction marker ZO-1. Cryostat sections of tissues confirm that rab13 localized to the junctional complex region of a variety of epithelia, including intestine, kidney, liver, and of endothelial cells. This localization requires assembly and integrity of the tight junctions. Disruption of tight junctions by incubation in low Ca2+ media induces the redistribution of rab13. In cells devoid of tight junctions, rab13 was found associated with vesicles dispersed throughout the cytoplasm. Cell-cell contacts initiated by E-cadherin in transfected L cells do not recruit rab13 to the resulting adherens-like junction complexes. The participation of rab13 in polarized transport, in the assembly and/or the activity of tight junctions is discussed.},

Studies concerning the function of the lipid metabolism of the airway epithelium are so far based only on the detection of lipids by immunohistochemistry but quantitative analyses have not been performed. Although recent advances in mass spectrometry have allowed to identify a variety of lipid classes simultaneously in isolated tissue samples, up until now, these methods were not suitable to analyze lipids in the airway epithelium. To determine all major lipid classes in airway epithelial cells, we used an LC\textendash MS-based approach that can easily be combined with the specific isolation procedure to obtain epithelial cells. We tested the suitability of this method with a mouse model of experimental asthma. In response to allergen challenge, perturbations in the sphingolipids were detected, which led to increased levels of ceramides. We expanded the scope of this approach analysing human bronchus samples without pathological findings of adenocarcinoma patients. For the human lung epithelium an unusual lipid class distribution was found in which ceramide was the predominant sphingolipid. In summary, we show that disease progression and lipid metabolism perturbation can be monitored in animal models and that the method can be used for the analysis of clinical samples.},

  abstract = {In the Timaeus Plato presents an elaborately wroughtaccount of the formation of the universe. Plato is deeply impressedwith the order and beauty he observes in the universe, and his projectin the dialogue is to explain that order and beauty. The universe, heproposes, is the product of rational, purposive, and beneficent agency.It is the handiwork of a divine Craftsman (``Demiurge,''d\^emiourgos, 28a6), who, imitating an unchanging andeternal model, imposes mathematical order on a preexistent chaos togenerate the ordered universe (kosmos). The governingexplanatory principle of the account is teleological: the universe as awhole as well as its various parts are so arranged as to produce a vastarray of good effects. It strikes Plato strongly that this arrangementis not fortuitous, but the outcome of the deliberate intent ofIntellect (nous), anthropomorphically represented by thefigure of the Craftsman who plans and constructs a world that is asexcellent as its nature permits it to be., As Plato tells it, the beautiful orderliness of the universe is notonly the manifestation of Intellect; it is also the model for rationalsouls to understand and to emulate. Such understanding and emulationrestores those souls to their original state of excellence, a statethat was lost in their embodiment. There is, then, an explicit ethicaland religious dimension to the discourse., This picture of a divinely created universe, though controversialfrom the start (see below, section 2), has captured the imagination and admiration of numerous generationsof philosophers and theologians though the centuries.[1] Because of the vast scope of the work, as well as its character as amonologue\textemdash by excluding exchanges between interlocutors thediscourse is much more like an authoritative statement than a set ofquestions to be investigated\textemdash the Timaeus was generallytaken to be the culmination of its author's intellectualachievement, particularly by thinkers in sympathy with its portrayalof the universe. Not surprisingly, as after the Renaissance thetheological worldview gave way to a more secular one, the culturalinfluence of the Timaeus began to wane over time. In thelatter part of the nineteenth and earlier part of the twentiethcentury interest in the Timaeus was again stimulated by therefinement of philological methods and exact historical scholarship,[2] but for most of the second half of the twentieth century the dialoguewas frequently dismissed as philosophically insignificant at best andregressive at worst. It played an important role in debates about thedevelopment of Plato's philosophy, but not much more. Recentdecades, however, have witnessed a revival of interest in theTimaeus: philosophers, historians of science and of ideas,and philologists, while not persuaded by the dialogue's boldclaims, have been fascinated by its majestic account and havesympathetically entered into and sought to elucidate its conceptualstructure.},

  abstract = {Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) chloride channels are gated by binding and hydrolysis of ATP at the nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs). We used covalent modification of CFTR channels bearing a cysteine engineered at position 334 to investigate changes in pore conformation that might accompany channel gating. In single R334C-CFTR channels studied in excised patches, modification by [2-(trimethylammonium)ethyl] methanethiosulfonate (MTSET+), which increases conductance, occurred only during channel closed states. This suggests that the rate of reaction of the cysteine was greater in closed channels than in open channels. R334C-CFTR channels in outside-out macropatches activated by ATP alone were modified with first order kinetics upon rapid exposure to MTSET+. Modification was much slower when channels were locked open by the addition of nonhydrolyzable nucleotide or when the R334C mutation was coupled to a second mutation, K1250A, which greatly decreases channel closing rate. In contrast, modification was faster in R334C/K464A-CFTR channels, which exhibit prolonged interburst closed states. These data indicate that the reactivity of the engineered cysteine in R334C-CFTR is state-dependent, providing evidence of changes in pore conformation coupled to ATP binding and hydrolysis at the NBDs. The data also show that maneuvers that lock open R334C-CFTR do so by locking channels into the prominent s2 subconductance state, suggesting that the most stable conducting state of the pore reflects the fully occupied, prehydrolytic state of the NBDs. \textcopyright{} 2005 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.}

As an anode for lithium ion batteries, cyclic voltammetry curves, electrochemical impedance spectra, and cyclability of the novel structured Ni-P nanoparticles were evaluated. It was found that the sample with a thicker crystalline shell exhibited improved capability and reversibility over the sample with a thinner one, especially at a higher discharge-charge current density.

  abstract = {Dramatic functional changes of enzyme usually require scores of alterations in amino acid sequence. However, in the case of guanylate kinase (GK), the functional novelty is induced by a single (S\textrightarrow P) mutation, leading to the functional transition of the enzyme from a phosphoryl transfer kinase into a phosphorprotein interaction domain. Here, by using molecular dynamic (MD) and metadynamics simulations, we provide a comprehensive description of the conformational transitions of the enzyme after mutating serine to proline. Our results suggest that the serine plays a crucial role in maintaining the closed conformation of wild-type GK and the GMP recognition. On the contrary, the S\textrightarrow P mutant exhibits a stable open conformation and loses the ability of ligand binding, which explains its functional transition from the GK enzyme to the GK domain. Furthermore, the free energy profiles (FEPs) obtained by metadymanics clearly demonstrate that the open-closed conformational transition in WT GK is positive correlated with the process of GMP binding, indicating the GMP-induced closing motion of GK enzyme, which is not observed in the mutant. In addition, the FEPs show that the S\textrightarrow P mutation can also leads to the mis-recognition of GMP, explaining the vanishing of catalytic activity of the mutant.},

In this study, we employed substituted cysteine accessibility methodology (SCAM) to screen the entire TM5 defined by the original topology model and its cytoplasmic extension in a Cysless background. We found six positions (A299, R303, N306, S307, F310, and F311) where engineered cysteines react to intracellular 2-sulfonatoethyl methanethiosulfonate (MTSES-). Quantification of the modification rate of engineered cysteines in the presence or absence of ATP suggests that these six residues are accessible in both the open and closed states. Whole-cell experiments with external MTSES- identified only two positive positions (L323 and A326), resulting in a segment containing 11 consecutive amino acids, where substituted cysteines respond to neither internal nor external MTSES-, a unique feature not seen previously in CFTR's pore-lining segments. The observation that these positions are inaccessible to channel-permeant thiol-specific reagent [Au(CN)2]2' suggests that this segment of TM5 between F311 and L323 is concealed from the pore by other TMs and/or lipid bilayers. In addition, our data support the idea that the positively charged arginine at position 303 poses a pure electrostatic action in determining the single-channel current amplitude of CFTR and the effect of an open-channel blocker glibencalmide. Collectively, we conclude that the cytoplasmic portion of CFTR's TM5 lines the pore. Our functional data are remarkably consistent with predicted structural arrangements of TM5 in some homology models of CFTR.}

In CFTR, we observe a large anion conduction pathway lined by numerous positively charged residues. A single gate near the extracellular surface closes the channel. The regulatory domain, dephosphorylated, is located in the intracellular opening between the two nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs), preventing NBD dimerization and channel opening.

Results from real time measurements indicated that covalent modification of single R334C-CFTR channels by [2-(trimethylammonium)ethyl]methanethiosulfonate resulted in the simultaneous modification of all three conductance levels in what appeared to be a single step, without changing the proportion of time spent in each state. This behavior suggests that at least a portion of the conduction path is common to all three conducting states. The time course for the modification of R334C-CFTR, measured in outside-out macropatches using a rapid perfusion system, was also consistent with a single modification step as if each pore contained only a single copy of the cysteine at position 334. These results are consistent with a model for the CFTR conduction pathway in which a single anion-conducting pore is formed by a single CFTR polypeptide.}

  abstract = {Dramatic functional changes of enzyme usually require scores of alterations in amino acid sequence. However, in the case of guanylate kinase (GK), the functional novelty is induced by a single (S\textrightarrow P) mutation, leading to the functional transition of the enzyme from a phosphoryl transfer kinase into a phosphorprotein interaction domain. Here, by using molecular dynamic (MD) and metadynamics simulations, we provide a comprehensive description of the conformational transitions of the enzyme after mutating serine to proline. Our results suggest that the serine plays a crucial role in maintaining the closed conformation of wild-type GK and the GMP recognition. On the contrary, the S\textrightarrow P mutant exhibits a stable open conformation and loses the ability of ligand binding, which explains its functional transition from the GK enzyme to the GK domain. Furthermore, the free energy profiles (FEPs) obtained by metadymanics clearly demonstrate that the open-closed conformational transition in WT GK is positive correlated with the process of GMP binding, indicating the GMP-induced closing motion of GK enzyme, which is not observed in the mutant. In addition, the FEPs show that the S\textrightarrow P mutation can also leads to the mis-recognition of GMP, explaining the vanishing of catalytic activity of the mutant.},

This structure reveals the position of the R domain after phosphorylation. By comparing the structures of human CFTR and zebrafish CFTR determined under the same condition, we identified common features essential to channel gating. The differences in their structures indicate plasticity permitted in evolution to achieve the same function. Finally, the structure of CFTR provides a better understanding of why the G178R, R352Q, L927P, and G970R/D mutations would impede conformational changes of CFTR and lead to cystic fibrosis.},

We used covalent modification of CFTR channels bearing a cysteine engineered at position 334 to investigate changes in pore conformation that might accompany channel gating. In single R334C-CFTR channels studied in excised patches, modification by [2-(trimethylammonium)ethyl] methanethiosulfonate (MTSET+), which increases conductance, occurred only during channel closed states. This suggests that the rate of reaction of the cysteine was greater in closed channels than in open channels. R334C-CFTR channels in outside-out macropatches activated by ATP alone were modified with first order kinetics upon rapid exposure to MTSET+. Modification was much slower when channels were locked open by the addition of nonhydrolyzable nucleotide or when the R334C mutation was coupled to a second mutation, K1250A, which greatly decreases channel closing rate. In contrast, modification was faster in R334C/K464A-CFTR channels, which exhibit prolonged interburst closed states. These data indicate that the reactivity of the engineered cysteine in R334C-CFTR is state-dependent, providing evidence of changes in pore conformation coupled to ATP binding and hydrolysis at the NBDs. The data also show that maneuvers that lock open R334C-CFTR do so by locking channels into the prominent s2 subconductance state, suggesting that the most stable conducting state of the pore reflects the fully occupied, prehydrolytic state of the NBDs. \textcopyright{} 2005 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.}

  abstract = {Extractive desulfurization of liquid fuel is a simple process that requires minimum energy input and can be operated via existing liquid-liquid extraction apparatuses. In particular, to achieve deep desulfurization, the conventional hydrodesulfurization (HDS) process has shown limitations in the removal of aromatic sulfur compounds. Recently, extractive desulfurization using a new type of nonvolatile solvent, ionic liquids (ILs), has yielded promising results. However, there is a lack of systematic evaluation of the effect of IL structure on desulfurization efficiency, and a lack of mechanistic understanding regarding how ILs lead to the partition of aromatic sulfur compounds from fuel to the IL phase. The present study examines a total of 71 ILs and two deep eutectic solvents (DESs) with combinations representing various cations and anions. We identify a number of ILs that yield high partition coefficients [up to 1.85 mg(S) kg (IL)-1/mg(S) kg (oil)-1] for the partition of aromatic sulfur compounds between ILs and n-octane or n-dodecane as surrogates for gasoline or diesel, respectively. We find that the high sulfur partition coefficient correlates with a high dipolarity/polarizability ({$\pi{_\ast}$}) or a low solvent polarizability (SP) of ILs carrying the same cation and different anions, but correlates with a low dipolarity/polarizability ({$\pi{_\ast}$}) for ILs carrying the same anion paired to cations bearing different alkyl chain lengths. We further demonstrate that a four-step extraction using ILs can achieve 99\% dibenzothiophene (DBT) removal (i.e., an initial sulfur content of 500 ppm is reduced to {$<$}5 ppm following extraction).},

The elastic area compressibility modulus was unaffected between pH 3 and 9 but was reduced by {$\sim$}30\% at pH 2.

  abstract = {GLIC is a bacterial member of the large family of pentameric ligand-gated ion channels. To study ion conduction through GLIC and other membrane channels, we combine the one-dimensional potential of mean force for ion passage with a Smoluchowski diffusion model, making it possible to calculate single-channel conductance in the regime of low ion concentrations from all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. We then perform MD simulations to examine sodium ion conduction through the GLIC transmembrane pore in two systems with different bulk ion concentrations. The ion potentials of mean force, calculated from umbrella sampling simulations with Hamiltonian replica exchange, reveal a major barrier at the hydrophobic constriction of the pore. The relevance of this barrier for ion transport is confirmed by a committor function that rises sharply in the barrier region. From the free evolution of Na(+) ions starting at the barrier top, we estimate the effective diffusion coefficient in the barrier region, and subsequently calculate the conductance of the pore. The resulting diffusivity compares well with the position-dependent ion diffusion coefficient obtained from restrained simulations. The ion conductance obtained from the diffusion model agrees with the value determined via a reactive-flux rate calculation. Our results show that the conformation in the GLIC crystal structure, with an estimated conductance of \textasciitilde 1 picosiemens at 140 mM ion concentration, is consistent with a physiologically open state of the channel.},

  abstract = {The weighted histogram analysis method (WHAM) has become the standard technique for the analysis of umbrella sampling simulations. In this article, we address the challenges (1) of obtaining fast and accurate solutions of the coupled nonlinear WHAM equations, (2) of quantifying the statistical errors of the resulting free energies, (3) of diagnosing possible systematic errors, and (4) of optimally allocating of the computational resources. Traditionally, the WHAM equations are solved by a fixed-point direct iteration method, despite poor convergence and possible numerical inaccuracies in the solutions. Here, we instead solve the mathematically equivalent problem of maximizing a target likelihood function, by using superlinear numerical optimization algorithms with a significantly faster convergence rate. To estimate the statistical errors in one-dimensional free energy profiles obtained from WHAM, we note that for densely spaced umbrella windows with harmonic biasing potentials, the WHAM free energy profile can be approximated by a coarse-grained free energy obtained by integrating the mean restraining forces. The statistical errors of the coarse-grained free energies can be estimated straightforwardly and then used for the WHAM results. A generalization to multidimensional WHAM is described. We also propose two simple statistical criteria to test the consistency between the histograms of adjacent umbrella windows, which help identify inadequate sampling and hysteresis in the degrees of freedom orthogonal to the reaction coordinate. Together, the estimates of the statistical errors and the diagnostics of inconsistencies in the potentials of mean force provide a basis for the efficient allocation of computational resources in free energy simulations.},

  abstract = {Accurate force field parameters for proteins and drugs are of fundamental importance for predicting protein-drug binding poses and binding free energies in structure-based drug design. Osmotic pressure simulations have recently gained popularity as a means to validate common force fields for biomolecules such as proteins; up to now, however, little such effort has been made to use these methods to validate common force fields for small drug-like molecules. In this work, osmotic coefficients of 16 drug-like molecules were calculated from osmotic pressure molecular dynamics simulations using four common force fields for drug-like molecules: GAFF, CGenFF, OPLS-AA, and PRODRGFF. While GAFF, CGenFF, and OPLS-AA produced osmotic coefficients that are in good agreement with the corresponding experimental osmotic coefficients, PRODRGFF, which attempts to use GROMOS parameters, often produced osmotic coefficients that are in poor agreement. All four force fields poorly reproduced the experimental osmotic coefficients of purine-derived molecules including purine, 6-methylpurine, and caffeine, suggesting common issues in describing interactions of this particular molecule type. The poor overall performance of PRODRGFF can be mainly attributed to the poor results with two macrocyclic molecules HMT and TAT, which can be significantly improved by reparameterizing the van der Waals (vdW) parameters of alkyl carbons and using lower solute concentration. In addition, the recently developed GAFF2 with revamped vdW parameters was found to produce osmotic coefficients that are in slightly better agreement with experiments than GAFF. Overall, the four common force fields for drug-like molecules tested in this study performed reasonably well at reproducing experimental osmotic coefficients of drug-like molecules, although failures of certain force fields on certain molecules suggest that further force field reparameterizations, especially for vdW parameters, might be required to improve their accuracy.},

  abstract = {The weighted ensemble (WE) path sampling approach orchestrates an ensemble of parallel calculations with intermittent communication to enhance the sampling of rare events, such as molecular associations or conformational changes in proteins or peptides. Trajectories are replicated and pruned in a way that focuses computational effort on underexplored regions of configuration space while maintaining rigorous kinetics. To enable the simulation of rare events at any scale (e.g., atomistic, cellular), we have developed an open-source, interoperable, and highly scalable software package for the execution and analysis of WE simulations: WESTPA (The Weighted Ensemble Simulation Toolkit with Parallelization and Analysis). WESTPA scales to thousands of CPU cores and includes a suite of analysis tools that have been implemented in a massively parallel fashion. The software has been designed to interface conveniently with any dynamics engine and has already been used with a variety of molecular dynamics (e.g., GROMACS, NAMD, OpenMM, AMBER) and cell-modeling packages (e.g., BioNetGen, MCell). WESTPA has been in production use for over a year, and its utility has been demonstrated for a broad set of problems, ranging from atomically detailed host-guest associations to nonspatial chemical kinetics of cellular signaling networks. The following describes the design and features of WESTPA, including the facilities it provides for running WE simulations and storing and analyzing WE simulation data, as well as examples of input and output.}
