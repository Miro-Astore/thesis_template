The physical properties are significantly affected by the structure of the carboxylic acid but the phase behavior of the mixtures can be simply modeled by taking account of the mole fraction of carboxylic acid in the mixture. The physical properties such as viscosity, conductivity, and surface tension of these DES are similar to ambient temperature ionic liquids and insight into the cause of these properties is gained using hole-theory. It is shown that the conductivity and viscosity of these liquids is controlled by ion mobility and the availability of voids of suitable dimensions, and this is consistent with the fluidity of other ionic liquids and molten salts. The DES are also shown to be good solvents for metal oxides, which could have potential application for metal extraction.}

  abstract = {The process of pectin depolymerization by pectate lyases and glycoside hydrolases produced by pectinolytic organisms, particularly the phytopathogens from the genus Erwinia, is reasonably well understood. Indeed each extracellular and intracellular catabolic stage has been identified using either genetic, bioinformatic or biochemical approaches. Nevertheless, the molecular details of many of these stages remain unknown. In particular, the mechanism and ligand binding profiles for the transport of pectin degradation products between cellular compartments remain entirely uninvestigated. Here we present the structure of TogB, a 45.7~kDa periplasmic binding protein from Yersinia enterocolitica. This protein is a component of the TogMNAB ABC transporter involved in the periplasmic transport of oligogalacturonides. In addition to the unliganded complex (at 2.2~\AA ), we have also determined the structures of TogB in complex with digalacturonic acid (at 2.2~\AA ), trigalacturonic acid (at 1.8~\AA ) and 4,5-unsaturated digalacutronic acid (at 2.3~\AA ). The molecular determinants of oligogalacturonide binding include a novel salt-bridge between the non-reducing sugar uronate group, selectivity for the unsaturated ligand, and the overall sugar configuration. Complementing this are UV difference and isothermal titration calorimetry experiments that highlight the thermodynamic basis of ligand specificity. The ligand binding profiles of the TogMNAB transporter complex nicely complement pectate lyase-mediated pectin degradation, which is a significant component of pectin depolymerization reactions.},

The newly generated or externally supplied PES data can then be used to train and optimize neural network or Gaussian process models in a completely automated fashion. Robust hyperparameter optimization schemes designed specifically for molecular PES applications are implemented to ensure that the best possible model for the data set is fit with high quality. The performance of PES-Learn toward fitting a few semiglobal PESs from the literature is evaluated. We also demonstrate the use of PES-Learn machine learning models in carrying out high-level vibrational configuration interaction computations on water and formaldehyde.}

This analysis aims to compare pricing and reimbursement of aforementioned cystic fibrosis medicines, across European countries.Methods: Clinical trial registries, national databases, health technology assessment reports and grey literature of Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, Poland, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Netherlands, the United Kingdom were consulted. Publicly available prices, reimbursement statuses, economic evaluations, budget impact analyses and managed entry agreements of CFTR modulators were examined. Results: In Belgium, lowest list prices were observed for Kalydeco\textregistered{} (ivacaftor) and Symkevi\textregistered{} (tezacaftor/ivacaftor) at \texteuro 417 per defined daily dose (DDD) and \texteuro 372 per average daily dose (ADD), respectively. Whereas, Switzerland had the lowest price for Orkambi\textregistered{} (lumacaftor/ivacaftor) listed at \texteuro 309 per DDD. Spain had the highest prices for Kalydeco\textregistered{} (ivacaftor) and Symkevi\textregistered{} (tezacaftor/ivacaftor) at \texteuro 850 per DDD and \texteuro 761 per ADD, whereas Orkambi\textregistered{} (lumacaftor/ivacaftor) was most expensive in Poland at \texteuro 983 per DDD. However, list prices were subject to confidential discounts and likely varied from actual costs. In all countries, these treatments were deemed not to be cost-effective. The annual budget impact of the CFTR modulators varied between countries and depended on factors such as local product prices, size of target population, scope of costs and discounting. However, all modulators were fully reimbursed in ten of the evaluated countries except for Sweden and Poland that, respectively, granted reimbursement to one and none of the therapies. Managed entry agreements were confidential but commonly adopted to address financial uncertainties.Conclusion: Discrepancies concerning prices, reimbursement and access were detected for Kalydeco\textregistered{} (ivacaftor), Orkambi\textregistered{} (lumacaftor/ivacaftor) and Symkevi\textregistered{} (tezacaftor/ivacaftor) across European countries.}

  abstract = {A limitation of traditional molecular dynamics (MD) is that reaction rates are difficult to compute. This is due to the rarity of observing transitions between metastable states since high energy barriers trap the system in these states. Recently the weighted ensemble (WE) family of methods have emerged which can flexibly and efficiently sample conformational space without being trapped and allow calculation of unbiased rates. However, while WE can sample correctly and efficiently, a scalable implementation applicable to interesting biomolecular systems is not available. We provide here a GPLv2 implementation called AWE-WQ of a WE algorithm using the master/worker distributed computing WorkQueue (WQ) framework. AWE-WQ is scalable to thousands of nodes and supports dynamic allocation of computer resources, heterogeneous resource usage (such as central processing units (CPU) and graphical processing units (GPUs) concurrently), seamless heterogeneous cluster usage (i.e., campus grids and cloud providers), and support for arbitrary MD codes such as GROMACS, while ensuring that all statistics are unbiased. We applied AWE-WQ to a 34 residue protein which simulated 1.5 ms over 8 months with peak aggregate performance of 1000 ns/h. Comparison was done with a 200's simulation collected on a GPU over a similar timespan. The folding and unfolded rates were of comparable accuracy.},

The deletion of phenylalanine 508 (F508del) in CFTR is the most common mutation responsible for cystic fibrosis. Little is known about the effect of the mutation in the isolated nucleotide binding domains (NBDs), on dimer dynamics, ATP hydrolysis and even on nucleotide binding. Using molecular dynamics simulations of the human CFTR NBD dimer, we showed that F508del increases, in the prehydrolysis state, the inter-motif distance in both ATP binding sites (ABP) when ATP is bound. Additionally, a decrease in the number of catalytically competent conformations was observed in the presence of F508del. We used the subtraction technique to study the first 300 ps after ATP hydrolysis in the catalytic competent site and found that the F508del dimer evidences lower conformational changes than the wild type. Using longer simulation times, the magnitude of the conformational changes in both forms increases. Nonetheless, the F508del dimer shows lower C-{$\alpha$} RMS values in comparison to the wild-type, on the F508del loop, on the residues surrounding the catalytic site and the portion of NBD2 adjacent to ABP1. These results provide evidence that F508del interferes with the NBD dynamics before and after ATP hydrolysis. These findings shed a new light on the effect of F508del on NBD dynamics and reveal a novel mechanism for the influence of F508del on CFTR.},

  abstract = {Abstract The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is a plasma-membrane anion channel that, when mutated, causes the disease cystic fibrosis. Although CFTR has been detected in a detergent-resistant membrane fraction prepared from airway epithelial cells, suggesting that it may partition into cholesterol-rich membrane microdomains (lipid rafts), its compartmentalization has not been demonstrated in intact cells and the influence of microdomains on CFTR lateral mobility is unknown. We used live-cell imaging, spatial image correlation spectroscopy, and k-space image correlation spectroscopy to examine the aggregation state of CFTR and its dynamics both within and outside microdomains in the plasma membrane of primary human bronchial epithelial cells. These studies were also performed during treatments that augment or deplete membrane cholesterol. We found two populations of CFTR molecules that were distinguishable based on their dynamics at the cell surface. One population showed confinement and had slow dynamics that were highly cholesterol dependent. The other, more abundant population was less confined and diffused more rapidly. Treatments that deplete the membrane of cholesterol caused the confined fraction and average number of CFTR molecules per cluster to decrease. Elevating cholesterol had the opposite effect, increasing channel aggregation and the fraction of channels displaying confinement, consistent with CFTR recruitment into cholesterol-rich microdomains with dimensions below the optical resolution limit. Viral infection caused the nanoscale microdomains to fuse into large platforms and reduced CFTR mobility. To our knowledge, these results provide the first biophysical evidence for multiple CFTR populations and have implications for regulation of their surface expression and channel function.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: A new approach in the treatment of cystic fibrosis involves improving the function of mutant cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). VX-770, a CFTR potentiator, has been shown to increase the activity of wild-type and defective cell-surface CFTR in vitro. METHODS: We randomly assigned 39 adults with cystic fibrosis and at least one G551D-CFTR allele to receive oral VX-770 every 12 hours at a dose of 25, 75, or 150 mg or placebo for 14 days (in part 1 of the study) or VX-770 every 12 hours at a dose of 150 or 250 mg or placebo for 28 days (in part 2 of the study). RESULTS: At day 28, in the group of subjects who received 150 mg of VX-770, the median change in the nasal potential difference (in response to the administration of a chloride-free isoproterenol solution) from baseline was -3.5 mV (range, -8.3 to 0.5; P=0.02 for the within-subject comparison, P=0.13 vs. placebo), and the median change in the level of sweat chloride was -59.5 mmol per liter (range, -66.0 to -19.0; P=0.008 within-subject, P=0.02 vs. placebo). The median change from baseline in the percent of predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 second was 8.7\% (range, 2.3 to 31.3; P=0.008 for the within-subject comparison, P=0.56 vs. placebo). None of the subjects withdrew from the study. Six severe adverse events occurred in two subjects (diffuse macular rash in one subject and five incidents of elevated blood and urine glucose levels in one subject with diabetes). All severe adverse events resolved without the discontinuation of VX-770. CONCLUSIONS: This study to evaluate the safety and adverse-event profile of VX-770 showed that VX-770 was associated with within-subject improvements in CFTR and lung function. These findings provide support for further studies of pharmacologic potentiation of CFTR as a means to treat cystic fibrosis.

The decision to pursue transplantation involves comparing the likelihood of survival with and without transplantation as well as assessing the effect of wait-listing and transplantation on the patient's quality of life. Although recent population-based analyses of the US lung allocation system for the CF population have raised controversies about the survival benefits of transplantation, studies from the United Kingdom and Canada have suggested a definite survival advantage for those receiving transplants. In response to these and other controversies, leaders in transplantation and CF met together in Lansdowne, Virginia, to consider the state of the art in lung transplantation for CF in an international context, focusing on advances in surgical technique, measurement of outcomes, use of prognostic criteria, variations in local control over listing, and prioritization among the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, and The Netherlands, patient adherence before and after transplantation and other issues in the broader context of lung transplantation. Finally, the conference members carefully considered how efforts to improve outcomes for lung transplantation for CF lung disease might best be studied.

  abstract = {Eukaryotic voltage-gated sodium (Nav) channels contribute to the rising phase of action potentials and served as an early muse for biophysicists laying the foundation for our current understanding of electrical signaling. Given their central role in electrical excitability, it is not surprising that (a) inherited mutations in genes encoding for Nav channels and their accessory subunits have been linked to excitability disorders in brain, muscle, and heart; and (b) Nav channels are targeted by various drugs and naturally occurring toxins. Although the overall architecture and behavior of these channels are likely to be similar to the more well-studied voltage-gated potassium channels, eukaryotic Nav channels lack structural and functional symmetry, a notable difference that has implications for gating and selectivity. Activation of voltage-sensing modules of the first three domains in Nav channels is sufficient to open the channel pore, whereas movement of the domain IV voltage sensor is correlated with inactivation. Also, structure\textendash function studies of eukaryotic Nav channels show that a set of amino acids in the selectivity filter, referred to as DEKA locus, is essential for Na+ selectivity. Structures of prokaryotic Nav channels have also shed new light on mechanisms of drug block. These structures exhibit lateral fenestrations that are large enough to allow drugs or lipophilic molecules to gain access into the inner vestibule, suggesting that this might be the passage for drug entry into a closed channel. In this Review, we will synthesize our current understanding of Nav channel gating mechanisms, ion selectivity and permeation, and modulation by therapeutics and toxins in light of the new structures of the prokaryotic Nav channels that, for the time being, serve as structural models of their eukaryotic counterparts.},

  abstract = {Ion channels are crucial components of living cells. They are situated in the membranes of the cell and allow particular ions to pass from one side of the membrane to the other. In recent years the patch clamp technique has allowed the activity of individual channels to be measured, and recombinant DNA technology has revealed fascinating detail on channel structure. Together, these technical advances have produced a great flowering of knowledge and understanding about the subject, itself leading to further breakthroughs in science and medicine. Ion Channels provides an introduction to this scientific endeavour. It emphasizes the molecular structure of channels as determined by gene cloning technology. This molecular approach illuminates discussions of the permeability and selectivity of channels, their gating and modulation, their responses to drugs and toxins and the human diseases caused when they do not function properly.},

Proteinopathy caused by cellular stresses such as endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, oxidative stress, mitochondrial stress and proteasomal stress and the formation of stress granules (SGs), cytoplasmic aggregates and inclusions is a hallmark of ALS. FUS and TDP-43, which are DNA/RNA binding proteins that regulate transcription, RNA homeostasis and protein translation are implicated in ALS proteinopathy. Disease-causing mutations in FUS and TDP-43 cause sequestration of these proteins and their interacting partners in the cytoplasm, which leads to aggregation. This mislocalization and formation of aggregates and SGs is cytotoxic and a contributor to neuronal death. We explore how loss-of-nuclear-function and gain-of-cytoplasmic function mechanisms that affect FUS and TPD-43 localization can generate a `stressed out' neuronal pathology and proteinopathy that drives ALS progression.},

  abstract = {CFTR is unique among ABC transporters as the only one functioning as an ion channel and from a human health perspective because mutations in its gene cause cystic fibrosis. Although considerable advances have been made towards understanding CFTR's mechanism of action and the impact of mutations, the lack of a high-resolution 3D structure has hindered progress. The large multi-domain membrane glycoprotein is normally present at low copy number and when over expressed at high levels it aggregates strongly, limiting the production of stable mono-disperse preparations. While the reasons for the strong self-association are not fully understood, its relatively low thermal stability seems likely to be one. The major CF causing mutation, {$\Delta$}F508, renders the protein very thermally unstable and therefore a great deal of attention has been paid to this property of CFTR. Multiple second site mutations of CFTR in NBD1 where F508 normally resides and small molecule binders of the domain increase the thermal stability of the mutant. These manipulations also stabilize the wild-type protein. Here we have applied {$\Delta$}F508-stabilizing changes and other modifications to generate wild-type constructs that express at much higher levels in scaled-up suspension cultures of mammalian cells. After purification and reconstitution into liposomes these proteins are active in a locked-open conformation at temperatures as high as 50\textdegree C and remain monodisperse at 4\textdegree C in detergent or lipid for at least a week. The availability of adequate amounts of these and related stable active preparations of homogeneous CFTR will enable stalled structural and ligand binding studies to proceed.},

  abstract = {Cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR) is a dynamic membrane protein belonging to the ABC transporter family. It is unusual within this family as it is an ion channel, as opposed to a transporter. Activation of CFTR requires ATP and phosphorylation by PKA, and dysregulation of CFTR mediated salt and water homeostasis can lead to cystic fibrosis. Recent advancements in structural biological methods have led to more than 10 published CFTR structures, and, so far, all of these structures of CFTR, determined by cryo-EM, have been limited to detergent-purified protein preparations. To visualize CFTR in an environment that more closely represents its native membranous environment, we utilized two different lipoprotein particle encapsulation techniques: one in which the ion channel is first purified and then reconstituted using the membrane scaffolding protein Saposin A and another that uses the solubilizing polymer Sokalan CP9 (DIBMA) to extract CFTR directly from membranes. Structures derived from these types of preparations may better correlate to their function, for instance, the single-channel measurements from membrane vesicles.},

Building block based CG models, such as the Martini model, possess the key advantage of allowing for a broad range of applications without the need to reparametrize the force field each time. However, there are certain inherent limitations to this approach, which we investigate in detail in this work. We first study the consequences of the absence of specific cross Lennard-Jones parameters between different particle sizes. We show that this lack may lead to artificially high free energy barriers in dimerization profiles. We then look at the effect of deviating too far from the standard bonded parameters, both in terms of solute partitioning behavior and solvent properties. Moreover, we show that too weak bonded force constants entail the risk of artificially inducing clustering, which has to be taken into account when designing elastic network models for proteins. These results have implications for the current use of the Martini CG model and provide clear directions for the reparametrization of the Martini model. Moreover, our findings are generally relevant for the parametrization of any other building block based force field.}

Despite being a multi-organ disease, extensive lung tissue destruction remains the major cause of morbidity and mortality. Progress towards a curative treatment strategy that implements a CFTR gene addition-technology to the patients' lungs has been slow and not yet developed beyond clinical trials. Improved delivery vectors are needed to overcome the body's defense system and ensure an efficient and consistent clinical response before gene therapy is suitable for clinical care. Cell-based therapy\textendash which relies on functional modification of allogenic or autologous cells ex vivo, prior to transplantation into the patient\textendash is now a therapeutic reality for various diseases. For CF, pioneering research has demonstrated proof-of-principle for allogenic transplantation of cultured human airway stem cells into mouse airways. However, applying a cell-based therapy to the human airways has distinct challenges. We review CF gene therapies using viral and non-viral delivery strategies and discuss current advances towards autologous cell-based therapies. Progress towards identification, correction, and expansion of a suitable regenerative cell, as well as refinement of pre-cell transplant lung conditioning protocols is discussed.}

At the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (SEP), we have since 1995 been developing and implementing the concept of a dynamic reference work (DRW) to provide a solution to these problems, while maintaining free access for readers. A DRW is much more than a web-based encyclopedia, and its scope far exceeds that of an electronic journal or preprint exchange. In this article we document the progress of the SEP toward full implementation of the DRW concept. We discuss the fiscal challenges posed by our desire to maintain free or low-cost access to the contents of the SEP, and we consider technological challenges posed by the desire to stay abreast of technological developments in document markup while making it easy for authors and subject editors to write and maintain entries representing the very best scholarship.

For this purpose, the high-resolution structure of the gramicidin A dimer is embedded in a dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine bilayer, and the potential of mean force of a K+ ion is calculated along the channel axis using the umbrella sampling method. Calculations are performed using two of the most common force fields in MD simulations: CHARMM and GROMACS. Both force fields lead to large central barriers for K+ ion permeation, that are substantially higher than those deduced from the physiological data by inverse methods. In long MD simulations lasting over 60ns, several ions are observed to enter the binding site but none of them crossed the channel despite the presence of a large driving field. The present results, taken together with many earlier studies, highlights the shortcomings of the standard force fields used in MD simulations of ion channels and calls for construction of more appropriate force fields for this purpose.},

  abstract = {In therian (eutherian and marsupial) mammals, X gene dosage between XY males and XX females is equalized by transcriptional silencing of one X chromosome in the somatic cells of females; a process called X chromosome inactivation (XCI). There are fundamental differences between the random, stable XCI in eutherians, and the paternal and partial system in marsupials, which can be exploited to dissect the mechanisms and evolution of XCI. A striking molecular difference is the involvement of DNA methylation in eutherian XCI, which seems, from a few previous studies, not to be mirrored by marsupials. I therefore searched for sex-specific DNA methylation of X-borne genes in marsupials using mass array bisulfate sequencing (Chapter 2). I tested methylation differences of six X-borne genes in four different tissues of male and female tammar wallaby and identified sex-specific methylation differences in 5' CpG islands of two genes. However, I observed no correlation between methylation status and inactivation of genes. I conclude that DNA methylation plays no role in maintaining inactivation (at least of the loci I examined) in marsupials. To gain new insights into the mechanisms and evolution of XCI I studied gene transcription at the level of individual nuclei (Chapters 3 and 4). I used RNA in situ hybridization to assess whether one or both alleles of X-borne loci were transcribed in fibroblasts from three marsupial model species (tammar wallaby, Tasmanian devil and South American opossum) and three eutherian species (human, mouse and elephant). In marsupials I observed that different X loci have a characteristic frequency of expression from one or both alleles, indicating that it is the probability of expression (either 1X-active or 2X-active), rather than the rate of transcription that contributes to the partial expression of the paternal allele. I observed no polarity that might reveal an X inactivation centre. Most orthologous genes on the conserved region of the eutherian X (XCR) were completely inactivated. However, genes that escape XCI on the evolutionarily distinct added region of the eutherian X (XAR, autosomal in marsupials) were 1X- or 2X-active in reproducible frequencies, analogous to genes on the marsupial  X. I therefore proposed that marsupial XCI, and the evolutionarily distinct XAR of the eutherian X, retain features of an ancient incomplete silencing mechanism, which was progressively stabilized (perhaps by the evolution of XIST) on the eutherian XCR. I then tested the hypothesis that incomplete stochastic monoallelic expression represents an ancient mechanism to control gene expression, which was exapted into genomic imprinting, as well as XCI. Genomic imprinting results in parent-specific monoallelic expression, and involves epigenetic modifications similar to genes on the inactive X. I therefore assessed transcription from nine autosomal-imprinted loci in mouse, and their tammar wallaby orthologues. Surprisingly, I observed biallelic expression of imprinted genes in a proportion of mouse and tammar nuclei. As for genes on the marsupial X and the eutherian XAR (as well as genes on the independently evolved platypus sex chromosomes), transcription appeared to be stochastic.},

The mechanism of CO2 capture is analyzed considering model flue gas, showing a two-stage process with water, CO2 and N2 molecules developing adsorbed layers at the interface but in different regions.

  abstract = {Science is an enormously successful human enterprise. The study ofscientific method is the attempt to discern the activities by whichthat success is achieved. Among the activities often identified ascharacteristic of science are systematic observation andexperimentation, inductive and deductive reasoning, and the formationand testing of hypotheses and theories. How these arecarried out in detail can vary greatly, but characteristics like thesehave been looked to as a way of demarcating scientific activity fromnon-science, where only enterprises which employ some canonical formof scientific method or methods should be considered science (see alsothe entry onscience and pseudo-science).  On the other hand, more recent debate has questioned whether there isanything like a fixed toolkit of methods which is common acrossscience and only science., Scientific method should be distinguished from the aims andproducts of science, such as knowledge, predictions, orcontrol. Methods are the means by which those goals areachieved. Scientific method should also be distinguished frommeta-methodology, which includes the values and justifications behinda particular characterizationof scientific method (i.e., a methodology) \textemdash values such as objectivity, reproducibility, simplicity,or past successes. Methodological rules are proposed to govern methodand it is a meta-methodological question whether methods obeying thoserules satisfy given values.  Finally, method is distinct, to some degree, fromthe detailed and contextual practices through which methods areimplemented. The latter might range over: specific laboratorytechniques; mathematical formalisms or other specialized languagesused in descriptions and reasoning; technological or other materialmeans; ways of communicating and sharing results, whether with otherscientists or with the public at large; or the conventions, habits,enforced customs, and institutional controls over how and what scienceis carried out., While it is important to recognize these distinctions, theirboundaries are fuzzy. Hence, accounts of method cannot be entirelydivorced from their methodological and meta-methodological motivationsor justifications, Moreover, each aspect plays a crucial role inidentifying methods. Disputes about method have therefore played outat the detail, rule, and meta-rule levels. Changes in beliefs aboutthe certainty or fallibility of scientific knowledge, for instance(which is a meta-methodological consideration of what we can hope formethods to deliver), have meant different emphases on deductive andinductive reasoning, or on the relative importance attached toreasoning over observation (i.e., differences over particularmethods.) Beliefs about the role of science in society will affect theplace one gives to values in scientific method. , The issue which has shaped debates over scientific method the most inthe last half century is the question of how pluralist do we need to beabout method? Unificationists continue to hold out for one methodessential to science; nihilism is a form of radical pluralism, whichconsiders the effectiveness of any methodological prescription to beso context sensitive as to render it not explanatory on its own. Somemiddle degree of pluralism regarding the methods embodied inscientific practice seems appropriate. But the details of scientificpractice vary with time and place, from institution toinstitution, across scientists and their subjects ofinvestigation. How significant are the variations for understandingscience and its success? How much can method be abstracted frompractice? This entry describes some of the attempts tocharacterize scientific method or methods, as well as arguments for a morecontext-sensitive approach to methods embedded in actual scientificpractices.},

Biblical laws, including these two examples, continue to influence Christian (especially Protestant) attitudes toward women, homosexuals, the poor, as well as those who are from different faiths or racial/ethnic origins. This book argues that such ancient laws and the corresponding contemporary attitudes ignore the harm caused to such groups and fail to consider that these groups may have different, yet valid, perspectives on the meaning of these texts. Specifically, this book argues that the Christian tradition has become inseparable from a privileged male perspective not reflecting the full range of persons found in its faith communities. Furthermore, it is this male norm that has historically established the accepted singular and determinative meaning of any given biblical text. Contemporary controversies about biblical interpretation, then, result from those other groups acknowledging that their realities differ from the putative norm and offering their own interpretations of problematic biblical texts. The book finds that inclusive biblical interpretation and its consideration of these normally excluded perspectives are consistent with the Christian tradition. This work advances support for inclusive interpretation from the Bible (both Old and New Testaments)-from the Protestant tradition itself, based on the writings of Martin Luther, John Calvin, and John Wesley-and from parallels with the interpretation and amendment of the U.S. Constitution.},

Nonetheless, there are fundamental unresolved issues in modeling the dynamics of aqueous salt solutions and the related problem of polymers dissolved in these solutions. In particular, experiments show that the self-diffusion coefficient, D, of water molecules in electrolyte solutions can be either enhanced or suppressed by particular salts having the same valence where the observed changes correlate with the Hofmeister series governing the relative solubility of proteins and water-soluble polymers in the same salt solutions. Recent studies have demonstrated that common atomistic models of aqueous electrolyte solutions completely fail to reproduce this basic phenomenon. Drawing on similar trends observed in the field of polymer nanocomposites, we propose a coarse-grained model of aqueous electrolyte solutions that captures the observed trends and that offers physical insight into the influence of salt on the thermodynamic and dynamic properties of electrolyte solutions.}

However, no theoretical framework currently exists that describes these property changes in an internally consistent fashion. In previous work, we developed a coarse-grained model of electrolyte solutions capable of reproducing basic trends on how salts influence the viscosity and water diffusion coefficient. The present work explores the predictions of this model for basic thermodynamic properties of electrolyte solutions, namely, the density, isothermal compressibility, and surface tension. On the basis of our model, we find that ion-specific effects on thermodynamics properties, and by extension the dynamics of electrolyte solutions, derive primarily from ion solvation.}

  abstract = {F\"orster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) between fluorescent proteins (FPs) is widely used to construct fluorescent sensor proteins, to study intracellular protein-protein interactions and to monitor conformational changes in multidomain proteins. Although FRET depends strongly on the orientation of the transition dipole moments (TDMs) of the donor and acceptor fluorophores, this orientation dependence is currently not taken into account in FRET sensor design. Similarly, studies that use FRET to derive structural constrains typically assume a {$\kappa$}2 of 2/3 or use the TDM of green fluorescent protein, as this is the only FP for which the TDM has been determined experimentally. Here we used time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) methods to calculate the TDM for a comprehensive list of commonly used fluorescent proteins. The method was validated against higher levels of calculation. Validation with model compounds and the experimentally determined TDM of GFP shows that the TDM is mostly determined by the structure of the {$\pi$}-conjugated fluorophore and is insensitive to non-conjugated side chains or the protein surrounding. Our calculations not only provide TDM for most of the currently used FPs, but also suggest an empirical rule that can be used to obtain the TDMs for newly developed fluorescent proteins in the future.

We previously demonstrated that ALS-associated mutant TDP43 accumulates within the cytoplasm, and that TDP43 mislocalization predicts neurodegeneration. Here, we sought to prevent neurodegeneration in ALS/FTD models using selective inhibitor of nuclear export (SINE) compounds that target exportin-1 (XPO1). SINE compounds modestly extend cellular survival in neuronal ALS/FTD models and mitigate motor symptoms in an in vivo rat ALS model. At high doses, SINE compounds block nuclear egress of an XPO1 cargo reporter, but not at lower concentrations that were associated with neuroprotection. Neither SINE compounds nor leptomycin B, a separate XPO1 inhibitor, enhanced nuclear TDP43 levels, while depletion of XPO1 or other exportins had little effect on TDP43 localization, suggesting that no single exporter is necessary for TDP43 export. Supporting this hypothesis, we find overexpression of XPO1, XPO7 and NXF1 are each sufficient to promote nuclear TDP43 egress. Taken together, our results indicate that redundant pathways regulate TDP43 nuclear export, and that therapeutic prevention of cytoplasmic TDP43 accumulation in ALS/FTD may be enhanced by targeting several overlapping mechanisms.},

  abstract = {Lipid membranes are indispensable to life, and they regulate countless cellular processes. To investigate the properties of membranes under controlled conditions, numerous reconstitution methods have been developed over the last few decades. Several of these methods result in the formation of lipid bilayers containing residual hydrophobic molecules between the two monolayers. These contaminants might alter membrane properties, including bilayer thickness, that is usually inferred from measurements of membrane capacitance assuming a simple slab model. However, recent measurements on solvent-free bilayers raised significant questions on the reliability of this approach. To reconcile the observed discrepancies, we developed a protocol to predict membrane capacitance from the dielectric profile of lipid bilayers computed from molecular dynamics simulations. Our methodology shows excellent agreement against available data on solvent-free noncharged bilayers, and it confirms that the uniform slab model is a reliable approximation from which to infer membrane capacitance. We find that the effective electrical thickness contributing to membrane capacitance is different from the hydrophobic thickness inferred from X-ray scattering form factors. We apply our model to estimate the concentration of residual solvent in reconstituted systems, and we propose that our protocol could be used to infer membrane properties in the presence of hydrophobic solvents.},

Peptide segments that include the characteristic histidine (His) diad, His(13) and His(14), efficiently block the Abeta channel activity, blocking Abeta cytotoxicity. We hypothesize that the vicinal His-His peptides coordinate with the rings of His in the mouth of the pore, thus blocking the flow of calcium ions through the channel, with consequent blocking of Abeta cytotoxicity. To test this hypothesis, we studied Abeta ion channel activity and cytotoxicity after the addition of compounds that are known to have His association capacity, such as Ni(2+), imidazole, His, and a series of His-related compounds. All compounds were effective at blocking both Abeta channel and preventing Abeta cytotoxicity. The efficiency of protection of His-related compounds was correlated with the number of imidazole side chains in the blocker compounds. These data reinforce the premise that His residues within the Abeta channel sequence are in the pathway of ion flow. Additionally, the data confirm the contribution of the Abeta channel to the cytotoxicity of exogenous Abeta.},

This is rather common in many single-particle cryo-EM projects, ranging from integral-membrane proteins to large macromolecular machineries or assemblies. In such situations, the cause of such poorly resolved regions is then clearly related to the sample homogeneity/heterogeneity rather than quality of the electron micrographs or the performance of the electron microscope. If the unresolved part is of critical biological importance, one often spends a tremendous amount of time and effort to resolve it, mostly by optimizing the sample preparation, ranging from ortholog screening to buffer optimization. In some cases, optimizing the biochemical conditions of the protein purification may improve the situation.},

X-ray reflectivity (XRR) and small angle neutron scattering (SANS) suggest that the behavior is significantly different from that in water. Our SANS data supports our determination of the critical micelle concentration using surface-tension measurements and suggests that the micelles formed in DES do not have the same shape and size as those seen in water. Reflectivity measurements have also demonstrated that the surfactants remain surface-active below this concentration.}

Herein, the pairwise interactions of the constituent components of the choline chloride-urea DES are examined. Evidence is found for a tripodal CH{$\cdots$}Cl doubly ionic H-bond motif. Moreover it is found that the covalency of doubly ionic H-bonds can be greater than, or comparable with, neutral and ionic examples. In contrast to many traditional solvents, an alphabet soup of many different types of H-bond (OH{$\cdots$}OC, NH...OC, OH...Cl, NH...Cl, OH...NH, CH...Cl, CH...OC, NH...OH and NH...NH) can form. These H-bonds exhibit substantial flexibility in terms of number and strength. It is anticipated that H-bonding will have a significant impact on the entropy of the system and thus could play an important role in the formation of the eutectic. The 2:1 urea:choline-chloride eutectic point of this DES is often associated with the formation of a [Cl(urea)2]- complexed anion. However, urea is found to form a H-bonded urea[choline]+ complexed cation that is energetically competitive with [Cl(urea)2]-. The negative charge on [Cl(urea)2]- is found to remain localised on the chloride, moreover, the urea[choline]+ complexed cation forms the strongest H-bond studied here. Thus, there is potential to consider a urea[choline]+{$\cdot$}urea[Cl]- interaction.}

This protein, NBD1 387\textendash 646({$\Delta$}405\textendash 436), crystallizes as a homodimer with a head-to-tail association equivalent to the active conformation observed for NBDs from symmetric ATP transporters. The 1.7-\AA{} resolution X-ray structure shows how ATP occupies the signature LSGGQ half-site in CFTR NBD1. The {$\Delta$}F508 version of this protein also crystallizes as a homodimer and differs from the wild-type structure only in the vicinity of the disease-causing F508 deletion. A slightly longer construct crystallizes as a monomer. Comparisons of the homodimer structure with this and previously published monomeric structures show that the main effect of ATP binding at the signature site is to order the residues immediately preceding the signature sequence, residues 542\textendash 547, in a conformation compatible with nucleotide binding. These residues likely interact with a transmembrane domain intracellular loop in the full-length CFTR channel. The experiments described here show that removing the RI from NBD1 converts it into a well-behaved protein amenable to biophysical studies yielding deeper insights into CFTR function.},

Several mutants exhibit functional defects, correctable by gating potentiators. Long-term exposure ({$\geq$}24\,h) to the only available potentiator drug, VX-770, leads to the biochemical and functional downregulation of F508del-CFTR both in immortalized and primary human airway cells, and possibly other CF mutants, attenuating its beneficial effect. Based on these considerations, we wanted to determine the effect of chronic VX-770 exposure on the functional and biochemical expression of rare CF processing/gating mutants in human airway epithelia. Expression of CFTR2 mutants was monitored in the human bronchial epithelial cell line (CFBE41o-) and in patient-derived conditionally reprogrammed bronchial and nasal epithelia by short-circuit current measurements, cell surface ELISA and immunoblotting in the absence or presence of CFTR modulators. The VX-770 half-maximal effective (EC50) concentration for G551D-CFTR activation was {$\sim$}0.63\,{$\mu$}M in human nasal epithelia, implying that comparable concentration is required in the lung to attain clinical benefit. Five of the twelve rare CFTR2 mutants were susceptible to {$\sim$}20-70\% downregulation by chronic VX-770 exposure with an IC50 of {$\sim$}1-20\,nM and to destabilization by other investigational potentiators, thereby diminishing the primary functional gain of CFTR modulators. Thus, chronic exposure to VX-770 and preclinical potentiators can destabilize CFTR2 mutants in human airway epithelial models in a mutation and compound specific manner. This highlights the importance of selecting potentiator drugs with minimal destabilizing effects on CF mutants, advocating a precision medicine approach.},

The endeavour of drug discovery for CFTR protein rescue is however difficult one since over 2000 mutations have been reported. For most of these, especially the rare ones, the associated defects, the respective functional class and their responsiveness to available modulators are still unknown. Our aim here was to characterize the rare R560S mutation using patient-derived materials (rectal biopsies and intestinal organoids) from one CF individual homozygous for this mutation, in parallel with cellular models expressing R560S-CFTR and to assess the functional and biochemical responses to CFTR modulators. METHODS: Intestinal organoids were prepared from rectal biopsies and analysed by RT-PCR (to assess CFTR mRNA), by Western blot (to assess CFTR protein) and by forskolin-induced swelling (FIS) assay. A novel cell line expressing R560S-CFTR was generated by stably transducing the CFBE parental cell line and used to assess R560S-CFTR processing and function. Both intestinal organoids and the cellular model were used to assess efficacy of CFTR modulators in rescuing this mutation. RESULTS: Our results show that: R560S does not affect CFTR mRNA splicing; R560S affects CFTR protein processing, totally abrogating the production of its mature form; R560S-CFTR evidences no function as a Cl- channel; and none of the modulators tested rescued R560S-CFTR processing or function. CONCLUSION: Altogether, these results indicate that R560S is a class II mutation. However, unlike F508del, it cannot be rescued by any of the CFTR modulators tested.},

Different culture expansion methods have been established to extend expansion capacity of airway basal cells, while retaining functional airway epithelium physiology. Considerable variation in response to CFTR modulators is observed in cultures even within the same CFTR genotype and despite the use of similar ALI culture techniques. We aimed to address culture expansion method impact on differentiation. METHODS: Nasal epithelial brushings from 14 individuals (CF=9; non-CF=5) were collected, then equally divided and expanded under conditional reprogramming culture (CRC) and feeder-serum-free "dual-SMAD inhibition" (SMADi) methods. Expanded cells from each culture were differentiated with proprietary PneumaCult\texttrademark -ALI media. Morphology (Immunofluorescence), global proteomics (LC-MS/MS) and function (barrier integrity, cilia motility, and ion transport) were compared in CRCALI and SMADiALI under basal and CFTR corrector treated (VX-809) conditions. RESULTS: No significant difference in the structural morphology or baseline global proteomics profile were observed. Barrier integrity and cilia motility were significantly different, despite no difference in cell junction morphology or cilia abundance. Epithelial Sodium Channels and Calcium-activated Chloride Channel activity did not differ but CFTR mediated chloride currents were significantly reduced in SMADiALI compare to their CRCALI counterparts. CONCLUSION: Alteration of cellular physiological function in vitro were more prominent than structural and differentiation potential in airway ALI. Since initial expansion culture conditions significantly influence CFTR activity, this could lead to false conclusions if data from different labs are compared against each other without specific reference ranges.},

  abstract = {Protein misfolding is involved in a large number of diseases, among which cystic fibrosis. Complex intra- and inter-domain folding defects associated with mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR) gene, among which p.Phe508del (F508del), have recently become a therapeutical target. Clinically approved correctors such as VX-809, VX-661, and VX-445, rescue mutant protein. However, their binding sites and mechanisms of action are still incompletely understood. Blind docking onto the 3D structures of both the first membrane-spanning domain (MSD1) and the first nucleotide-binding domain (NBD1), followed by molecular dynamics simulations, revealed the presence of two potential VX-809 corrector binding sites which, when mutated, abrogated rescue. Network of amino acids in the lasso helix 2 and the intracellular loops ICL1 and ICL4 allosterically coupled MSD1 and NBD1. Corrector VX-445 also occupied two potential binding sites on MSD1 and NBD1, the latter being shared with VX-809. Binding of both correctors on MSD1 enhanced the allostery between MSD1 and NBD1, hence the increased efficacy of the corrector combination. These correctors improve both intra-domain folding by stabilizing fragile protein\textendash lipid interfaces and inter-domain assembly via distant allosteric couplings. These results provide novel mechanistic insights into the rescue of misfolded proteins by small molecules.},

  abstract = {Set theory is the mathematical theory of well-determinedcollections, called sets, of objects that are calledmembers, or elements, of the set. Pure set theorydeals exclusively with sets, so the only sets under consideration arethose whose members are also sets. The theory of thehereditarily-finite sets, namely those finite sets whoseelements are also finite sets, the elements of which are also finite,and so on, is formally equivalent to arithmetic. So, the essence ofset theory is the study of infinite sets, and therefore it can bedefined as the mathematical theory of the actual\textemdash as opposed topotential\textemdash infinite., The notion of set is so simple that it is usually introducedinformally, and regarded as self-evident. In set theory, however, asis usual in mathematics, sets are given axiomatically, so theirexistence and basic properties are postulated by the appropriateformal axioms. The axioms of set theory imply the existence of aset-theoretic universe so rich that all mathematical objects can beconstrued as sets. Also, the formal language of pure set theory allowsto formalize all mathematical notions and arguments. Thus, set theoryhas become the standard foundation for mathematics, as everymathematical object can be viewed as a set, and every theorem ofmathematics can be logically deduced in the Predicate Calculus fromthe axioms of set theory., Both aspects of set theory, namely, as the mathematical science ofthe infinite, and as the foundation of mathematics, are ofphilosophical importance.},

  abstract = {Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is caused by mutations to the Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (CFTR) chloride channel. CFTR is composed of two membrane spanning domains, two cytosolic nucleotide-binding domains (NBD1 and NBD2) and a largely unstructured R-domain. Multiple CF-causing mutations reside in the NBDs and some are known to compromise the stability of these domains. The ability to predict the effect of mutations on the stability of the cytosolic domains of CFTR and to shed light on the mechanisms by which they exert their effect is therefore important in CF research. With this in mind, we have predicted the effect on domain stability of 59 mutations in NBD1 and NBD2 using 15 different algorithms and evaluated their performances via comparison to experimental data using several metrics including the correct classification rate (CCR), and the squared Pearson correlation (R2) and Spearman's correlation ({$\rho$}) calculated between the experimental {$\Delta$}Tm values and the computationally predicted {$\Delta\Delta$}G values. Overall, the best results were obtained with FoldX and Rosetta. For NBD1 (35 mutations), FoldX provided R2 and {$\rho$} values of 0.64 and -0.71, respectively, with an 86\% correct classification rate (CCR). For NBD2 (24 mutations), FoldX R2, {$\rho$}, and CCR were 0.51, -0.73, and 75\%, respectively. Application of the Rosetta high-resolution protocol (Rosetta\_hrp) to NBD1 yielded R2, {$\rho$}, and CCR of 0.64, -0.75, and 69\%, respectively, and for NBD2 yielded R2, {$\rho$}, and CCR of 0.29, -0.27, and 50\%, respectively. The corresponding numbers for the Rosetta's low-resolution protocol (Rosetta\_lrp) were R2 = 0.47, {$\rho$} = -0.69, and CCR = 69\% for NBD1 and R2 = 0.27, {$\rho$} = -0.24, and CCR = 63\% for NBD2. For NBD1, both algorithms suggest that destabilizing mutations suffer from destabilizing vdW clashes, whereas stabilizing mutations benefit from favorable H-bond interactions. Two triple consensus approaches based on FoldX, Rosetta\_lpr, and Rosetta\_hpr were attempted using either ``majority-voting'' or ``all-voting''. The all-voting consensus outperformed the individual predictors, albeit on a smaller data set. In summary, our results suggest that the effect of mutations on the stability of CFTR's NBDs could be largely predicted. Since NBDs are common to all ABC transporters, these results may find use in predicting the effect and mechanism of the action of multiple disease-causing mutations in other proteins.},

In addition, nucleotide binding and hydrolysis at the nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs) of CFTR are required for channel gating. We report NMR studies in the absence and presence of NBD1 that provide structural details for the isolated R region and its interaction with NBD1 at residue-level resolution. Several sites in the R region with measured fractional helical propensity mediate interactions with NBD1. Phosphorylation reduces the helicity of many R-region sites and reduces their NBD1 interactions. This evidence for a dynamic complex with NBD1 that transiently engages different sites of the R region suggests a structural explanation for the dependence of CFTR activity on multiple PKA phosphorylation sites. \textcopyright{} 2007 Nature Publishing Group.},

  abstract = {The time step of atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations is determined by the fastest motions in the system and is typically limited to 2 fs. An increasingly popular solution is to increase the mass of the hydrogen atoms to \textasciitilde 3 amu and decrease the mass of the parent atom by an equivalent amount. This approach, known as hydrogen-mass repartitioning (HMR), permits time steps up to 4 fs with reasonable simulation stability. While HMR has been applied in many published studies to date, it has not been extensively tested for membrane-containing systems. Here, we compare the results of simulations of a variety of membranes and membrane-protein systems run using a 2-fs time step and a 4-fs time step with HMR. For pure membrane systems, we find almost no difference in structural properties, such as area-per-lipid, electron density profiles, and order parameters, although there are differences in kinetic properties such as the diffusion constant. Conductance through a porin in an applied field, partitioning of a small peptide, hydrogen-bond dynamics, and membrane mixing show very little dependence on HMR and the time step. We also tested a 9-\AA{} cutoff compared to the standard CHARMM cutoff of 12 \AA, finding significant deviations in many properties tested. We conclude that HMR is a valid approach for membrane systems but a 9-\AA{} cutoff is not.,},

However, the gastrointestinal tract presents a formidable barrier to oral delivery of biologics. Here we report the development of a highly effective oral insulin formulation using choline and geranate (CAGE) ionic liquid. CAGE significantly enhanced paracellular transport of insulin, while protecting it from enzymatic degradation and by interacting with the mucus layer resulting in its thinning. In vivo, insulin-CAGE demonstrated exceptional pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic outcome after jejunal administration in rats. Low insulin doses (3\textendash 10 U/kg) brought about a significant decrease in blood glucose levels, which were sustained for longer periods (up to 12 hours), unlike s.c. injected insulin. When 10 U/kg insulin-CAGE was orally delivered in enterically coated capsules using an oral gavage, a sustained decrease in blood glucose of up to 45\% was observed. The formulation exhibited high biocompatibility and was stable for 2 months at room temperature and for at least 4 months under refrigeration. Taken together, the results indicate that CAGE is a promising oral delivery vehicle and should be further explored for oral delivery of insulin and other biologics that are currently marketed as injectables.},

Here, we have studied different conformations of P-glycoprotein simultaneously in the presence of ivacaftor, a known competitive inhibitor. In order to conduct this, we used high contrast cryo-electron microscopy imaging with a Volta phase plate. We associate the presence of ivacaftor with the appearance of an additional density in one of the conformational states detected. The additional density is in the central aqueous cavity and is associated with a wider separation of the two halves of the transporter in the inward-facing state. Conformational changes to the nucleotide-binding domains are also observed and may help to explain the stimulation of ATPase activity that occurs when transported substrate is bound in many ATP binding cassette transporters.},

Mutations in the CFTR gene lead to reduced or dysfunctional CFTR protein and cause cystic fibrosis (CF), a generalized exocrinopathy affecting multiple organs. In the airways, loss of CFTR function leads to thickened mucus, reduced mucociliary clearance, chronic infections, and respiratory failure. Common airway disorders such as bronchitis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) also present CF-like symptoms such as mucus congestion and chronic inflammation without mutations in CFTR. The primary risk factors for COPD and chronic bronchitis include environmental stress insults such as pollutants and infections that often result in hypoxic conditions. Furthermore, environmental factors such as cigarette smoke and reactive oxygen species have been implicated in reduced CFTR function. Activation of cellular stress responses by these factors promotes differential, stress-associated gene expression regulation. During our investigations on the mechanisms of CFTR expression regulation, we have shown that the ER stress response, the unfolded protein response (UPR), decreases CFTR expression at the transcriptional, translational, and maturational levels. Here, we provide a detailed description of the methods we employ to study CFTR expression regulation by the UPR. Similar approaches are applicable in studies on other genes and how they are affected by the UPR.},

We followed the temperature at the membrane with submillisecond time resolution by measuring the time-course of membrane capacitance, which is linearly related to temperature. We applied Tjumps in Kir 1.1b, which reveals a highly temperature-sensitive blockage relief and characterized the effects of Tsteps on the temperature-sensitive channels TRPM8 and TRPV1.

We show that the boundary and its curvature are the crucial factors in determining how an ion's potential energy depends on the dielectric constants near an interface. The potential energy of an ion outside a globular protein has a dominant 1/{$\epsilon$}w dependence, but this becomes 1/{$\epsilon$}p for an ion inside a cavity. For channels, where the boundaries are in between these two extremes, the situation is more complex. In general, we find that variations in {$\epsilon$}w have a much larger impact on the potential energy of an ion compared to those in {$\epsilon$}p. Therefore a better understanding of the effective {$\epsilon$}w values employed in channel models is desirable. Although the precise value of {$\epsilon$}p is not a crucial determinant of ion permeation properties, it still needs to be chosen carefully when quantitative comparisons with data are made.}

We discuss five commercial instruments that partition samples into physically isolated chambers (cdPCR) or droplet emulsions (ddPCR). We compare the strengths of dPCR (absolute quantitation, precision, and ability to detect rare or mutant targets) with those of its predecessor, quantitative real-time PCR (dynamic range, larger sample volumes, and throughput). Lastly, we describe several promising applications of dPCR, including copy number variation, quantitation of circulating tumor DNA and viral load, RNA/miRNA quantitation with reverse transcription dPCR, and library preparation for next-generation sequencing. This review is intended to give a broad perspective to scientists interested in adopting digital assays into their workflows. Part II focuses on digital protein and cell assays.},

  abstract = {There are more H atoms than any other type of atom in an X-ray crystal structure of a protein-ligand complex, but as H atoms only have one electron they diffract X-rays weakly and are 'hard to see'. The positions of many H atoms can be inferred by our chemical knowledge, and such H atoms can be added with confidence in 'riding positions'. For some chemical groups, however, there is more ambiguity over the possible hydrogen placements, for example hydroxyls and groups that can exist in multiple protonation states or tautomeric forms. This ambiguity is far from rare, since about 25\% of drugs have more than one tautomeric form. This paper focuses on the most common, 'prototropic', tautomers, which are isomers that readily interconvert by the exchange of an H atom accompanied by the switch of a single and an adjacent double bond. Hydrogen-exchange rates and different protonation states of compounds (e.g. buffers) are also briefly discussed. The difference in heavy (non-H) atom positions between two tautomers can be small, and careful refinement of all possible tautomers may single out the likely bound ligand tautomer. Experimental methods to determine H-atom positions, such as neutron crystallography, are often technically challenging. Therefore, chemical knowledge and computational approaches are frequently used in conjugation with experimental data to deduce the bound tautomer state. Proton movement is a key feature of many enzymatic reactions, so understanding the orchestration of hydrogen/proton motion is of critical importance to biological chemistry. For example, structural studies have suggested that, just as a chemist may use heat, some enzymes use directional movement to protonate specific O atoms on phosphates to catalyse phosphotransferase reactions. To inhibit 'wriggly' enzymes that use movement to effect catalysis, it may be advantageous to have inhibitors that can maintain favourable contacts by adopting different tautomers as the enzyme 'wriggles'.H atoms are 'hard to see' in X-ray crystal structures of protein-ligand complexes. This paper discusses the problem of identifying the correct tautomeric form(s) of protein-bound ligands.},

Laboratory experiments, however, often study evolution in well-mixed systems. Here we introduce an experimental device, the Microbial Evolution and Growth Arena (MEGA) plate, in which bacteria spread and evolve on a large antibiotic landscape (120x60cm), allowing visual observation of mutation and selection in a migrating bacterial front. While resistance increases consistently, multiple coexisting lineages diversify both phenotypically and genotypically. Analyzing mutants at and behind the propagating front, we find that evolution is not always led by the most resistant mutants; highly resistant mutants may be trapped behind more sensitive lineages. The MEGA-plate provides a versatile platform for studying microbial adaption and a direct seeing-is-believing visualization of evolutionary dynamics.},

The L\"owenheim-Skolem theorem says that if afirst-order theory has infinite models, then it has models whosedomains are only countable. Cantor's theorem says that some sets areuncountable. Skolem's Paradox arises when we notice that the basicprinciples of Cantorian set theory\textemdash i.e., the very principles usedto prove Cantor's theorem on the existence of uncountablesets\textemdash can themselves be formulated as a collection of first-ordersentences. How can the very principles which prove the existence ofuncountable sets be satisfied by a model which is itself onlycountable? How can a countable model satisfy the first-order sentencewhich says that there are uncountably many mathematicalobjects\textemdash e.g., uncountably many real numbers?, Philosophical discussion of this paradox has tended to focus onthree main questions. First, there's a purely mathematical question:why doesn't Skolem's Paradox introduce an outright contradiction intoset theory? Second, there's a historical question. Skolem himself gavea pretty good explanation as to why Skolem's Paradox doesn't constitutea straightforward mathematical contradiction; why, then, did Skolem andhis contemporaries continue to find the paradox so philosophicallytroubling? Finally there's a purely philosophical question: what, ifanything, does Skolem's Paradox tell us about our understanding of settheory and/or about the semantics of set-theoretic language?},

  abstract = {Many applications in chemistry, biology, and energy storage/conversion research rely on molecular simulations to provide fundamental insight into structural and transport properties of materials with high ionic concentrations. Whether the system is comprised entirely of ions, like ionic liquids, or is a mixture of a polar solvent with a salt, e.g., liquid electrolytes for battery applications, the presence of ions in these materials results in strong local electric fields polarizing solvent molecules and large ions. To predict properties of such systems from molecular simulations often requires either explicit or mean-field inclusion of the influence of polarization on electrostatic interactions. In this manuscript, we review the pros and cons of different treatments of polarization ranging from the mean-field approaches to the most popular explicit polarization models in molecular dynamics simulations of ionic materials. For each method, we discuss their advantages and disadvantages and emphasize key assumptions as well as their adjustable parameters. Strategies for the development of polarizable models are presented with a specific focus on extracting atomic polarizabilities. Finally, we compare simulations using polarizable and nonpolarizable models for several classes of ionic systems, discussing the underlying physics that each approach includes or ignores, implications for implementation and computational efficiency, and the accuracy of properties predicted by these methods compared to experiments.}

  abstract = {The past six decades have seen remarkable improvements in health outcomes for people with cystic fibrosis, which was once a fatal disease of infants and young children. However, although life expectancy for people with cystic fibrosis has increased substantially, the disease continues to limit survival and quality of life, and results in a large burden of care for people with cystic fibrosis and their families. Furthermore, epidemiological studies in the past two decades have shown that cystic fibrosis occurs and is more frequent than was previously thought in populations of non-European descent, and the disease is now recognised in many regions of the world. The Lancet Respiratory Medicine Commission on the future of cystic fibrosis care was established at a time of great change in the clinical care of people with the disease, with a growing population of adult patients, widespread genetic testing supporting the diagnosis of cystic fibrosis, and the development of therapies targeting defects in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), which are likely to affect the natural trajectory of the disease. The aim of the Commission was to bring to the attention of patients, health-care professionals, researchers, funders, service providers, and policy makers the various challenges associated with the changing landscape of cystic fibrosis care and the opportunities available for progress, providing a blueprint for the future of cystic fibrosis care. The discovery of the CFTR gene in the late 1980s triggered a surge of basic research that enhanced understanding of the pathophysiology and the genotype-phenotype relationships of this clinically variable disease. Until recently, available treatments could only control symptoms and restrict the complications of cystic fibrosis, but advances in CFTR modulator therapies to address the basic defect of cystic fibrosis have been remarkable and the field is evolving rapidly. However, CFTR modulators approved for use to date are highly expensive, which has prompted questions about the affordability of new treatments and served to emphasise the considerable gap in health outcomes for patients with cystic fibrosis between high-income countries, and low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs). Advances in clinical care have been multifaceted and include earlier diagnosis through the implementation of newborn screening programmes, formalised airway clearance therapy, and reduced malnutrition through the use of effective pancreatic enzyme replacement and a high-energy, high-protein diet. Centre-based care has become the norm in high-income countries, allowing patients to benefit from the skills of expert members of multidisciplinary teams. Pharmacological interventions to address respiratory manifestations now include drugs that target airway mucus and airway surface liquid hydration, and antimicrobial therapies such as antibiotic eradication treatment in early-stage infections and protocols for maintenance therapy of chronic infections. Despite the recent breakthrough with CFTR modulators for cystic fibrosis, the development of novel mucolytic, anti-inflammatory, and anti-infective therapies is likely to remain important, especially for patients with more advanced stages of lung disease. As the median age of patients with cystic fibrosis increases, with a rapid increase in the population of adults living with the disease, complications of cystic fibrosis are becoming increasingly common. Steps need to be taken to ensure that enough highly qualified professionals are present in cystic fibrosis centres to meet the needs of ageing patients, and new technologies need to be adopted to support communication between patients and health-care providers. In considering the future of cystic fibrosis care, the Commission focused on five key areas, which are discussed in this report: the changing epidemiology of cystic fibrosis (section 1); future challenges of clinical care and its delivery (section 2); the building of cystic fibrosis care globally (section 3); novel therapeutics (section 4); and patient engagement (section 5). In panel 1, we summarise key messages of the Commission. The challenges faced by all stakeholders in building and developing cystic fibrosis care globally are substantial, but many opportunities exist for improved care and health outcomes for patients in countries with established cystic fibrosis care programmes, and in LMICs where integrated multidisciplinary care is not available and resources are lacking at present. A concerted effort is needed to ensure that all patients with cystic fibrosis have access to high-quality health care in the future.},

  abstract = {The Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Regulator (CFTR) is a membrane protein whose mutations cause cystic fibrosis, a lethal genetic disease. We performed a molecular dynamic (MD) study of the properties of the nucleotide binding domains (NBD) whose conformational changes, upon ATP binding, are the direct responsible of the gating mechanisms of CFTR. This study was done for the wild type (WT) CFTR and for the two most common mutations, {$\Delta$}F508, that produces a traffic defect of the protein, and the mutation G551D, that causes a gating defect on CFTR. Using an homology model of the open channel conformation of the CFTR we thus introduced the mutations to the structure. Although the overall structures of the G551D and {$\Delta$}F508 are quite well conserved, the NBD1-NBD2 interactions are severely modified in both mutants. NBD1 and NBD2 are indeed destabilized with a higher internal energy (Ei) in the {$\Delta$}F508-CFTR. Differently, Ei does not change in the NBDs of G551D but, while the number of close contacts between NBD1 and NBD2 in {$\Delta$}F508 is increased, a significant reduction of close contacts is found in the G551D mutated form. Hydrogen bonds formation between NBDs of the two mutated forms is also altered and it is slightly increased for the {$\Delta$}F508, while are severely reduced in G551D. A consequent modification of the NBDs-ICLs interactions between residues involved in the transduction of the ATP binding and the channel gating is also registered. Indeed, while a major interaction is noticed between NBDs interface and ICL2 and ICL4 in the WT, this interaction is somehow altered in both mutated forms plausibly with effect on channel gating. Thus, single point mutations of the CFTR protein can reasonably results in channel gating defects due to alteration of the interaction mechanisms between the NBDs and NBDs-ICLs interfaces upon ATP-binding process.},

For many channels, the details of gating remain unclear, partly due to limited structural data and simulation timescales. Here, we used enhanced sampling to simulate the pH-gated channel GLIC, and construct Markov state models (MSMs) of gating. Consistent with new functional recordings, we report in oocytes, our analysis revealed differential effects of protonation and mutation on free-energy wells. Clustering of closed- versus open-like states enabled estimation of open probabilities and transition rates, while higher-order clustering affirmed conformational trends in gating. Furthermore, our models uncovered state- and protonation-dependent symmetrization. This demonstrates the applicability of MSMs to map energetic and conformational transitions between ion-channel functional states, and how they reproduce shifts upon activation or mutation, with implications for modeling neuronal function and developing state-selective drugs.},

  abstract = {Background: The natural food supplements curcumin and genistein, and the drug ivacaftor were found effective as CFTR potentiators in the organoids of individuals carrying a S1251N gating mutation, possibly in a synergistic fashion. Based on these in vitro findings, we evaluated the clinical efficacy of a treatment with curcumin, genistein and ivacaftor, in different combinations. Methods: In three multi-center trials people with CF carrying the S1251N mutation were treated for 8 weeks with curcumin+genistein, ivacaftor and ivacaftor+genistein. We evaluated change in lung function, sweat chloride concentration, CFQ-r, BMI and fecal elastase to determine the clinical effect. We evaluated the pharmacokinetic properties of the compounds by evaluating the concentration in plasma collected after treatment and the effect of the same plasma on the intestinal organoids. Results: A clear clinical effect of treatment with ivacaftor was observed, evidenced by a significant improvement in clinical parameters. In contrast we observed no clear clinical effect of curcumin and/or genistein, except for a small but significant reduction in sweat chloride and airway resistance. Plasma concentrations of the food supplements were low, as was the response of the organoids to this plasma. Conclusions: We observed a clear clinical effect of treatment with ivacaftor, which is in line with the high responsiveness of the intestinal organoids to this drug. No clear clinical effect was observed of the treatment with curcumin and/or genistein, the low plasma concentration of these compounds emphasizes that pharmacokinetic properties of a compound have to be considered when in vitro experiments are performed.},

  abstract = {During neurodegenerative disease, the multifunctional RNA-binding protein TDP-43 undergoes a vast array of post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, acetylation, and cleavage. Many of these alterations may directly contribute to the pathogenesis of TDP-43 proteinopathies, which include most forms of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and approximately half of all frontotemporal dementia, pathologically identified as frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) with TDP-43 pathology. However, the relative contributions of the various TDP-43 post-translational modifications to disease remain unclear, and indeed some may be secondary epiphenomena rather than disease-causative. It is therefore critical to determine the involvement of each modification in disease processes to allow the design of targeted treatments. In particular, TDP-43 C-terminal fragments (CTFs) accumulate in the brains of people with ALS and FTLD and are therefore described as a neuropathological signature of these diseases. Remarkably, these TDP-43 CTFs are rarely observed in the spinal cord, even in ALS which involves dramatic degeneration of spinal motor neurons. Therefore, TDP-43 CTFs are not produced non-specifically in the course of all forms of TDP-43-related neurodegeneration, but rather variably arise due to additional factors influenced by regional heterogeneity in the central nervous system. In this review, we summarize how TDP-43 CTFs are generated and degraded by cells, and critique evidence from studies of TDP-43 CTF pathology in human disease tissues, as well as cell and animal models, to analyze the pathophysiological relevance of TDP-43 CTFs to ALS and FTLD. Numerous studies now indicate that, although TDP-43 CTFs are prevalent in ALS and FTLD brains, disease-related pathology is only variably reproduced in TDP-43 CTF cell culture models. Furthermore, TDP-43 CTF expression in both transgenic and viral-mediated in vivo models largely fails to induce motor or behavioral dysfunction reminiscent of human disease. We therefore conclude that although TDP-43 CTFs are a hallmark of TDP-43-related neurodegeneration in the brain, they are not a primary cause of ALS or FTLD.},

Methods: The study was a single-center, comparative, randomized, crossover, Phase I study in 24 healthy adults. Each participant received six injections in the abdomen area of either a 2 or 3 mL placebo solution, with three different fluid viscosities (1, 8\textendash 10, and 15\textendash 20 cP) combined with two different injection flow rates (0.02 and 0.3 mL/s). All injections were performed with 50 mL syringes and 27G, 6 mm needles. Perceived injection pain was assessed using a 100 mm visual analog scale (VAS) (0 mm/no pain, 100 mm/extreme pain). The location and depth of the injected fluid was assessed through 2D ultrasound echography images. Results: Viscosity levels had significant impact on perceived injection pain (P=0.0003). Specifically, less pain was associated with high viscosity (VAS =12.6 mm) than medium (VAS =16.6 mm) or low (VAS =22.1 mm) viscosities, with a significant difference between high and low viscosities (P=0.0002). Target injection volume of 2 or 3 mL was demonstrated to have no significant impact on perceived injection pain (P=0.89). Slow (0.02 mL/s) or fast (0.30 mL/s) injection rates also showed no significant impact on perceived pain during SC injection (P=0.79). In 92\% of injections, the injected fluid was located exclusively in SC tissue whereas the remaining injected fluids were found located in SC and/or intradermal layers. Conclusion: The results of this study suggest that solutions of up to 3 mL and up to 15\textendash 20 cP injected into the abdomen within 10 seconds are well tolerated without pain. High viscosity injections were shown to be the most tolerated, whereas injection volume and flow rates did not impact perceived pain.},

In a previous study we reported the occurrence of activating somatic mutations of G{$\alpha$}s, which transduces mitogenic signals, in 30\% of the analyzed JGCTs. Methods: We have searched for alterations in other proteins involved in ovarian mitogenic signaling. We focused on the PI3K-AKT axis. As we found mutations in AKT1, we analyzed the subcellular localization of the mutated proteins and performed functional explorations using Western-blot and luciferase assays. Findings: We detected in-frame duplications affecting the pleckstrin-homology domain of AKT1 in more than 60\% of the tumors occurring in girls under 15 years of age. The somatic status of the mutations was confirmed when peritumoral DNA was available. The JGCTs without duplications carried point mutations affecting highly conserved residues. Several of these substitutions were somatic lesions. The mutated proteins carrying the duplications had a non-wild-type subcellular distribution, with a marked enrichment at the plasma membrane. This led to a striking degree of AKT1 activation demonstrated by a strong phosphorylation level and by reporter assays. Interpretation: Our study incriminates somatic mutations of AKT1 as a major event in the pathogenesis of JGCTs. The existence of AKT inhibitors currently tested in clinical trials opens new perspectives for targeted therapies for these tumors, which are currently treated with standard non-specific chemotherapy protocols.},

Our MD results agree quite closely with the experimental results. In particular, our MD results predict that the salt with a larger anion (NaCl) shows a smaller increase in surface tension than the salt with a smaller anion (NaF). To check the limits of applicability of the solvent primitive model (SPM), we solve exactly the system with the approximation that the solvent (water) is a background dielectric continuum using MD simulations. Compared with explicit water MD simulations, SPM gives qualitatively incorrect results for the dependence of surface tension on the type of salt. More precisely, with the solvent as a dielectric continuum, an NaCl solution shows a larger increase in surface tension than does an NaF solution. Strong water structuring around the solvated ions is the proposed explanation.}

  abstract = {Understanding the functional consequence of rare Cystic Fibrosis (CF) mutations is mandatory for the adoption of precision therapeutic approaches for CF. Here we studied the effect of the very rare CF mutation, W361R, on CFTR processing and function. We applied western blot, patch clamp and pharmacological modulators of CFTR to study the maturation and ion transport properties of pEGFP-WT and mutant CFTR constructs, W361R, F508del and L69H-CFTR, expressed in HEK293 cells. Structural analyses were also performed to study the molecular environment of the W361 residue. Western blot showed that W361R-CFTR was not efficiently processed to a mature band C, similar to F508del CFTR, but unlike F508del CFTR, it did exhibit significant transport activity at the cell surface in response to cAMP agonists. Importantly, W361R-CFTR also responded well to CFTR modulators: its maturation defect was efficiently corrected by VX-809 treatment and its channel activity further potentiated by VX-770. Based on these results, we postulate that W361R is a novel class-2 CF mutation that causes abnormal protein maturation which can be corrected by VX-809, and additionally potentiated by VX-770, two FDA-approved small molecules. At the structural level, W361 is located within a class-2 CF mutation hotspot that includes other mutations that induce variable disease severity. Analysis of the 3D structure of CFTR within a lipid environment indicated that W361, together with other mutations located in this hotspot, is at the edge of a groove which stably accommodates lipid acyl chains. We suggest this lipid environment impacts CFTR folding, maturation and response to CFTR modulators.},

We investigated the corrector effect of c407 and its derivatives on F508del-CFTR protein. Molecular docking and dynamics simulations combined with site-directed mutagenesis suggested that c407 stabilizes the F508del-Nucleotide Binding Domain 1 (NBD1) during the co-translational folding process by occupying the position of the p.Phe1068 side chain located at the fourth intracellular loop (ICL4). After CFTR domains assembly, c407 occupies the position of the missing p.Phe508 side chain. C407 alone or in combination with the F508del-CFTR corrector VX-809, increased CFTR activity in cell lines but not in primary respiratory cells carrying the F508del mutation. A structure-based approach resulted in the synthesis of an extended c407 analog G1, designed to improve the interaction with ICL4. G1 significantly increased CFTR activity and response to VX-809 in primary nasal cells of F508del homozygous patients. Our data demonstrate that in-silico optimized c407 derivative G1 acts by a mechanism different from the reference VX-809 corrector and provide insights into its possible molecular mode of action. These results pave the way for novel strategies aiming to optimize the flawed ICL4\textendash NBD1 interface.},

It is based on the premise that K+ ions maintain a complete hydration shell while passing between the transmembrane cavity and cytosol, which must be accommodated. To put the canonical model to the test, we locked the conformation of a Kir K+ channel to prevent widening of the narrow collar. Unexpectedly, conduction was unimpaired in the locked channels. In parallel, we employed all-atom molecular dynamics to simulate K+ ions moving along the conduction pathway between the lower cavity and cytosol. During simulations, the constriction did not significantly widen. Instead, transient loss of some water molecules facilitated K+ permeation through the collar. The low free energy barrier to partial dehydration in the absence of conformational change indicates Kir channels are not gated by the canonical mechanism.},

Its unique properties place this powerful, well-conserved, but still poorly-understood signaling system at the center of the coordinated cellular interactions required for complex pattern formation.

Therefore, an obligatory step in the virus life cycle is the delivery of the viral genome inside the cell. Enveloped viruses (i.e., viruses with a lipid envelope) use a two-step procedure to release their genetic material into the cell: (i) they first bind to specific surface receptors of the target cell membrane and then, (ii) they fuse the viral and cell membranes. This last step may occur at the cell surface or after internalization of the virus particle by endocytosis or by some other route (e.g., macropinocytosis). Remarkably, the virus-cell membrane fusion process goes essentially along the same intermediate steps as other membrane fusions that occur for instance in vesicular fusion at the nerve synapsis or cell-cell fusion in yeast mating. Specialized viral proteins, fusogens, promote virus-cell membrane fusion. The viral fusogens experience drastic structural rearrangements during fusion, liberating the energy required to overcome the repulsive forces that prevent spontaneous fusion of the two membranes. This chapter describes the different types of viral fusogens and their mode of action, as are currently known.},

Despite changes in donor and recipient selection, long-term survival in pediatric lung transplant has continued to be limited by chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD). Due to, in part, this short survival benefit, transplant continues to be an appropriate option for only a subset of pediatric patients with CF. The feasibility of transplant as a therapeutic option is also affected by the limited pediatric organ supply, which has moreover contributed to controversy over lung allocation. Debates over the allocation of this scarce resource, however, may also help to drive innovation in the field of lung transplant. Longer pretransplant survival\textemdash as aided by new lung bypass technologies, for example\textemdash could help to alleviate organ shortages, as well as facilitate the transport of organs to suitable pediatric recipients. Improved diagnosis and treatment for CLAD and for antibody-mediated rejection have the potential to extend survival in pediatric lung transplant. Regardless, the relative rarity of transplant could pose future challenges for pediatric lung transplant programs, which require adequate numbers of patients to maintain proper expertise.},

  abstract = {The regulation of the volume and composition of airway surface liquid is achieved through epithelial ion transport processes. In humans, these processes have been characterized in proximal but not distal airways. Segments of human bronchioles were dissected from surgically removed lung pieces. The transmural potential difference of microperfused bronchioles was inhibited by luminal exposure to amiloride and increased when exposed to the Cl secretagogues forskolin and ATP in the presence of amiloride. Human bronchiolar epithelial cells were cultured on permeable supports and studied in Ussing chambers. They generated a short circuit current (Isc) that decreased in response to amiloride and increased in response to forskolin and to ATP in the presence of amiloride. In low-Cl Kreb's Ringer bicarbonate, the baseline Isc and amiloride-induced decrease in Isc were not different, whereas the forskolin- and ATP-induced increases in Isc were smaller. Fluid transport measurement in excised bronchioles revealed a basal absorptive flow that was reduced by amiloride, whereas forskolin and ATP combined induced a secretory flow in the presence of amiloride. We conclude that human bronchioles actively absorb Na and fluid in unstimulated conditions and are capable of active Cl and fluid secretion when exposed to forskolin and to ATP.},

  abstract = {Structure determination by cryo electron microscopy (cryo-EM) provides information on structural heterogeneity and ensembles at atomic resolution. To obtain cryo-EM images of macromolecules, the samples are first rapidly cooled down to cryogenic temperatures. To what extent the structural ensemble is perturbed during cooling is currently unknown. Here, to quantify the effects of cooling, we combined continuum model calculations of the temperature drop, molecular dynamics simulations of a ribosome complex before and during cooling with kinetic models. Our results suggest that three effects markedly contribute to the narrowing of the structural ensembles: thermal contraction, reduced thermal motion within local potential wells, and the equilibration into lower free-energy conformations by overcoming separating free-energy barriers. During cooling, barrier heights below 10\,kJ/mol were found to be overcome, which is expected to reduce B-factors in ensembles imaged by cryo-EM. Our approach now enables the quantification of the heterogeneity of room-temperature ensembles from cryo-EM structures.},

Identification of subjects that may benefit from these drugs is challenging because of the extensive heterogeneity of CFTR mutations, as well as other unknown factors that contribute to individual drug efficacy. Here, we describe a simple and relatively rapid assay for measuring individual CFTR function and response to CFTR modulators in vitro. Three dimensional (3D) epithelial organoids are grown from rectal biopsies in standard organoid medium. Once established, the organoids can be bio-banked for future analysis. For the assay, 30-80 organoids are seeded in 96-well plates in basement membrane matrix and are then exposed to drugs. One day later, the organoids are stained with calcein green, and forskolin-induced swelling is monitored by confocal live cell microscopy at 37 \textdegree C. Forskolin-induced swelling is fully CFTR-dependent and is sufficiently sensitive and precise to allow for discrimination between the drug responses of individuals with different and even identical CFTR mutations. In vitro swell responses correlate with the clinical response to therapy. This assay provides a cost-effective approach for the identification of drug-responsive individuals, independent of their CFTR mutations. It may also be instrumental in the development of future CFTR modulators.},

  abstract = {Mutations in the gene encoding cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) result in cystic fibrosis (CF). CFTR is a chloride channel that is regulated by phosphorylation and gated by ATP binding and hydrolysis at its nucleotide binding domains (NBDs). G551D-CFTR, the third most common CF-associated mutation, has been characterized as having a lower open probability (Po) than wild-type (WT) channels. Patients carrying the G551D mutation present a severe clinical phenotype. On the other hand, G1349D, also a mutant with gating dysfunction, is associated with a milder clinical phenotype. Residues G551 and G1349 are located at equivalent positions in the highly conserved signature sequence of each NBD. The physiological importance of these residues lies in the fact that the signature sequence of one NBD and the Walker A and B motifs from the other NBD form the ATP-binding pocket (ABP1 and ABP2, named after the location of the Walker A motif) once the two NBDs dimerize. Our studies show distinct gating characteristics for these mutants. The G551D mutation completely eliminates the ability of ATP to increase the channel activity, and the observed activity is {$\sim$}100-fold smaller than WT-CFTR. G551D-CFTR does not respond to ADP, AMP-PNP, or changes in [Mg2+]. The low activity of G551D-CFTR likely represents the rare ATP-independent gating events seen with WT channels long after the removal of ATP. G1349D-CFTR maintains ATP dependence, albeit with a Po {$\sim$}10-fold lower than WT. Interestingly, compared to WT results, the ATP dose\textendash response relationship of G1349D-CFTR is less steep and shows a higher apparent affinity for ATP. G1349D data could be well described by a gating model that predicts that binding of ATP at ABP1 hinders channel opening. Thus, our data provide a quantitative explanation at the single-channel level for different phenotypes presented by patients carrying these two mutations. In addition, these results support the idea that CFTR's two ABPs play distinct functional roles in gating.},

  abstract = {Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is a chloride channel gated by ATP binding and hydrolysis at its nucleotide binding domains (NBD). The NBDs dimerize in a head-to-tail configuration, forming two ATP binding pockets (ABP) with the ATP molecules buried at the dimer interface. Previous studies have indicated that ABP2, formed by the Walker A and B motifs of NBD2 and the signature sequence of NBD1, is the site critical for the ATP-dependent opening of CFTR. The G551D mutation in ABP2, the third most common cystic fibrosis-associated mutation, abolishes ATP-dependent gating, resulting in an open probability that is {$\sim$}100-fold lower than that of wild-type channels. Interestingly, we found that the ATP analog N6-(2-phenylethyl)-ATP (P-ATP) increases G551D currents mainly by increasing the open time of the channel. This effect is reduced when P-ATP is applied together with ATP, suggesting a competition between ATP and P-ATP for a common binding site. Introducing mutations that lower the nucleotide binding affinity at ABP2 did not alter significantly the effects of P-ATP on G551D-CFTR, whereas an equivalent mutation at ABP1 (consisting of the Walker A and B motifs of NBD1 and the signature sequence of NBD2) dramatically decreased the potency of P-ATP, indicating that ABP1 is the site where P-ATP binds to increase the activity of G551D-CFTR. These results substantiate the idea that nucleotide binding at ABP1 stabilizes the open channel conformation. Our observation that P-ATP enhances the G551D activity by binding at ABP1 implicates that ABP1 can potentially be a target for drugs to bind and increase the channel activity.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: There are nearly 2000 cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR) mutations that cause cystic fibrosis (CF). These mutations are classified into six classes; on the one hand, the first three classes cause severe disease involvement in early childhood, on the other hand, the Class IV, V and VI mutations cause minor severe disease in the same age. Nowadays, with therapeutic advances in CF management and competence of pediatricians, physicians of adults have to deal with two groups of CF patients: (i) adults diagnosed in childhood with severe mutations and (ii) adults who initiated symptoms in adulthood and with Class IV, V and VI mutations. The aim of this study was to analyze adults from a clinical center, treated as CF disease, screening the CFTR genotype and evaluating the clinical characteristics. METHODS: Thirty patients followed as CF disease at the University Hospital were enrolled. After a complete molecular CFTR negative screening and sweat test levels between 40 and 59mEq/L, five patients were characterized as non-CF disease and were excluded. Molecular screening was performed by CFTR gene sequencing/MLPA or by specific mutation screening. Clinical data was obtained from medical records. The patients were divided into three groups: (1) patients with Class I, II and III mutations in two CFTR alleles; (2) genotype with at least one allele of Class IV, V or VI CFTR mutations and, (3) non-identified CFTR mutation+one patient with one allele with CFTR mutation screened (Class I). RESULTS: There was an association of CFTR class mutation and sodium/chloride concentration in the sweat test (sodium: p=0.040; chloride: p=0.016), onset of digestive symptoms (p=0.012), lung function parameter (SpO2 - p=0.016), Bhalla score (p=0.021), age at diagnosis (p=0.008) and CF-related diabetes (p=0.029). There was an association between Pseudomonas aeruginosa chronic colonization (as clinical marker for the lung disease status) and lung impairment (FEV1\% - p=0.027; Bhalla score - p=0.021), CF-related diabetes (p=0.040), chloride concentration in the sweat test (p=0.040) and chronic infection by microorganisms (Staphylococcus aureus - p=0.039; mucoid P. aeruginosa - p=0.001). There is no positive association with the status of other clinical markers and the CFTR genotype groups. For clinical association with pancreatic insufficiency (as clinical marker for digestive symptoms), no association was related. CONCLUSION: The adults with CF diagnosed by sweat test have specific clinical and genotypic characteristics, being a population that should be studied to cause better future management. Some patients treated as CF disease by clinical symptoms, showed no disease, taking into account the sweat test and complete exon sequencing/MLPA screening.},

We test this method on alanine dipeptide, using the nonlinearly separable data set composed by atomic distances. We then study an intermolecular aldol reaction characterized by a concerted mechanism. The resulting variables are able to promote sampling by drawing nonlinear paths in the physical space connecting the fluctuations between metastable basins. Lastly, we interpret the behavior of the neural network by studying its relation to the physical variables. Through the identification of its most relevant features, we are able to gain chemical insight into the process.},

ATP is universally seen as the energy exchange factor that connects anabolism and catabolism but also fuels processes such as motile contraction, phosphorylations, and active transport. It is also a signalling molecule in the purinergic signalling mechanisms. In this review, we will discuss all the main mechanisms of ATP production linked to ADP phosphorylation as well the regulation of these mechanisms during stress conditions and in connection with calcium signalling events. Recent advances regarding ATP storage and its special significance for purinergic signalling will also be reviewed.},

Studies of CF cultures, transgenic mice, and CF patients suggest that the initiating event in CF airways disease pathogenesis is reduced airway surface liquid (ASL) volume, i.e., dehydration. CF ASL volume regulation depends on a single extracellular signaling system, ATP, which renders CF airways more vulnerable to disease-causing insults (e.g., viruses) than are normal airways, which regulate ASL volume by dual ATP and adenosine signaling pathways. Clinical studies have explored the hypothesis that treating the dehydration of CF airways will be therapeutically beneficial. Inhaled hypertonic saline osmotically draws water onto airway surfaces, improves mucus clearance and pulmonary function, and reduces acute exacerbations in CF patients. Thus, rehydration therapies may slow the progression of CF lung disease in patients with established bacterial infection and may prevent the onset of CF lung disease if initiated early in life.

METHODS: Thirty-two patients were treated for anorexia nervosa on an inpatient unit, and were assessed before and after treatment. The inpatient milieu was designed to use cognitive therapy as the primary therapeutic intervention, along with weight restoration. RESULTS: At discharge, all patients displayed significant change in core eating disorder psychopathology in their depressive symptoms, as well as in general aspects of psychopathology. At one-year follow-up, changes in some areas of core eating disorder psychopathology and depressive symptoms continued to be significantly different than from admissions. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of CBT and weight restoration can significantly reduce eating disorder symptoms, depression, and general psychopathology during hospitalization, with some sustained benefit over a one year period. Future research is needed to identify the effect of CBT on anorexia nervosa during a wide variety of treatment settings. Also, research must focus on the influence of outpatient treatment in the outcome of anorexia nervosa.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The phe508del CFTR mutation causes cystic fibrosis by limiting the amount of CFTR protein that reaches the epithelial cell surface. We tested combination treatment with lumacaftor, an investigational CFTR corrector that increases trafficking of phe508del CFTR to the cell surface, and ivacaftor, a CFTR potentiator that enhances chloride transport of CFTR on the cell surface. METHODS: In this phase 2 clinical trial, we assessed three successive cohorts, with the results of each cohort informing dose selection for the subsequent cohort. We recruited patients from 24 cystic fibrosis centres in Australia, Belgium, Germany, New Zealand, and the USA. Eligibility criteria were: confirmed diagnosis of cystic fibrosis, age at least 18 years, and a forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) of 40\% or more than predicted. Cohort 1 included phe508del CFTR homozygous patients randomly assigned to either lumacaftor 200 mg once per day for 14 days followed by addition of ivacaftor 150 mg or 250 mg every 12 h for 7 days, or 21 days of placebo. Together, cohorts 2 and 3 included phe508del CFTR homozygous and heterozygous patients, randomly assigned to either 56 days of lumacaftor (cohort 2: 200 mg, 400 mg, or 600 mg once per day, cohort 3: 400 mg every 12 h) with ivacaftor 250 mg every 12 h added after 28 days, or 56 days of placebo. The primary outcomes for all cohorts were change in sweat chloride concentration during the combination treatment period in the intention-to-treat population and safety (laboratory measurements and adverse events). The study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01225211, and EudraCT, number 2010-020413-90. FINDINGS: Cohort 1 included 64 participants. Cohort 2 and 3 combined contained 96 phe508del CFTR homozygous patients and 28 compound heterozygotes. Treatment with lumacaftor 200 mg once daily and ivacaftor 250 mg every 12 h decreased mean sweat chloride concentration by 9.1 mmol/L (p{$<$}0.001) during the combination treatment period in cohort 1. In cohorts 2 and 3, mean sweat chloride concentration did not decrease significantly during combination treatment in any group. Frequency and nature of adverse events were much the same in the treatment and placebo groups during the combination treatment period; the most commonly reported events were respiratory. 12 of 97 participants had chest tightness or dyspnoea during treatment with lumacaftor alone. In pre-planned secondary analyses, a significant decrease in sweat chloride concentration occurred in the treatment groups between day 1 and day 56 (lumacaftor 400 mg once per day group -9.1 mmol/L, p{$<$}0.001; lumacaftor 600 mg once per day group -8.9 mmol/L, p{$<$}0.001; lumacaftor 400 mg every 12 h group -10.3 mmol/L, p=0.002). These changes were significantly greater than the change in the placebo group. In cohort 2, the lumacaftor 600 mg once per day significantly improved FEV1 from day 1 to 56 (difference compared with placebo group: +5.6 percentage points, p=0.013), primarily during the combination period. In cohort 3, FEV1 did not change significantly across the entire study period compared with placebo (difference +4.2 percentage points, p=0.132), but did during the combination period (difference +7.7 percentage points, p=0{$\cdot$}003). Phe508del CFTR heterozygous patients did not have a significant improvement in FEV1. INTERPRETATION: We provide evidence that combination lumacaftor and ivacaftor improves FEV1 for patients with cystic fibrosis who are homozygous for phe508del CFTR, with a modest effect on sweat chloride concentration. These results support the further exploration of combination lumacaftor and ivacaftor as a treatment in this setting.

  abstract = {Intrinsically disordered proteins play crucial roles in regulatory processes and often function as protein interaction hubs. Here, we present a detailed characterization of a full-length disordered hub protein region involved in multiple dynamic complexes. We performed NMR, CD, and fluorescence binding studies on the nonphosphorylated and highly PKA-phosphorylated human cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) regulatory region, a {$\sim$}200-residue disordered segment involved in phosphorylation- dependent regulation of channel trafficking and gating. Our data provide evidence for dynamic, phosphorylation-dependent, multisite interactions of various segments of the regulatory region for its intra- and intermolecular partners, including the CFTR nucleotide binding domains 1 and 2, a 42-residue peptide from the C terminus of CFTR, the SLC26A3 sulphate transporter and antisigma factor antagonist (STAS) domain, and 14-3-3{$\beta$}. Because of its large number of binding partners, multivalent binding of individually weak sites facilitates rapid exchange between free and bound states to allow the regulatory region to engage with different partners and generate a graded or rheostat-like response to phosphorylation. Our results enrich the understanding of how disordered binding segments interact with multiple targets. We present structural models consistent with our data that illustrate this dynamic aspect of phospho-regulation of CFTR by the disordered regulatory region.}

  abstract = {The binding of zinc (Zn) ions to proteins is important for many cellular events. The theoretical and computational description of this binding (as well as that of other transition metals) is a challenging task. In this paper the binding of the Zn ion to four cysteine residues in the structural site of horse liver alcohol dehydrogenase (HLADH) is studied using a synthetic peptide mimic of this site. The study includes experimental measurements of binding constants, classical free energy calculations from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and quantum mechanical (QM) electron structure calculations. The classical MD results account for interactions at the molecular level and reproduce the absolute binding energy and the hydration free energy of the Zn ion with an accuracy of about 10\%. This is insufficient to obtain correct free energy differences. QM correction terms were calculated from density functional theory (DFT) on small clusters of atoms to include electronic polarisation of the closest waters and covalent contributions to the Zn-S coordination bond. This results in reasonably good agreement with the experimentally measured binding constants and Zn ion hydration free energies in agreement with published experimental values. The study also includes the replacement of one cysteine residue to an alanine. Simulations as well as experiments showed only a small effect of this upon the binding free energy. A detailed analysis indicate that the sulfur is replaced by three water molecules, thereby changing the coordination number of Zn from four (as in the original peptide) to six (as in water). \textcopyright{} the Owner Societies.}

With the help of these two variables the authors combine features of approaches such as metadynamics or umbrella sampling with those of path based methods. This allows global searches in the space of paths to be performed and a new variational principle for the determination of low free energy paths to be established. Contrary to metadynamics or umbrella sampling the path can be described by an arbitrary large number of variables, still the energy profile along the path can be calculated. The authors exemplify the method numerically by studying the conformational changes of alanine dipeptide. \textcopyright{} 2007 American Institute of Physics.},

Patient-derived model systems may therefore aid in expanding access to these drugs. Brushed human nasal epithelial cells (HNEs) are an attractive tissue source, but it remains unclear how faithfully they recapitulate human bronchial epithelial cell (HBE) CFTR activity. We examined this gap using paired, brushed HNE/HBE samples from pediatric CF subjects with a wide variety of CFTR mutations cultured at the air-liquid interface. Growth and structural characteristics for the two cell types were similar, including differentiation into mature respiratory epithelia. In electrophysiologic analysis, no correlation was identified between nasal and bronchial cultures in baseline resistance or epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) activity. Conversely, robust correlation was demonstrated between nasal and bronchial cultures in both stimulated and inhibited CFTR activity. There was close correlation in modulator-induced change in CFTR activity, and CFTR activity in both cell types correlated with in vivo sweat chloride measurements. These data confirm that brushed HNE cell cultures recapitulate the functional CFTR characteristics of HBEs with fidelity and are therefore an appropriate noninvasive HBE surrogate for individualized CFTR analysis.},

Nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) is the predominant DNAdouble-strand break (DSB) repair pathway in mammalian cells and is initiated by DSB ends being recognized by the Ku70/Ku80 (Ku) heterodimer. By using MLN4924, an anti-cancer drug in clinical trials that specifically inhibits conjugation of the ubiquitin-like protein, NEDD8, to target proteins, we demonstrate that NEDD8 accumulation at DNA-damage sites is a highly dynamic process. In addition, we show that depleting cells of the NEDD8 E2-conjugating enzyme, UBE2M, yields ionizing radiation hypersensitivity and reduced cell survival following NHEJ. Finally, we demonstrate that neddylation promotes Ku ubiquitylation after DNA damage and release of Ku and Ku-associated proteins from damage sites following repair. These studies provide insights into how the NHEJ core complex dissociates from repair sites and highlight its importance for cell survival following DSB induction.},

MLN4924 is a selective inhibitor of NAE currently in clinical trials for the treatment of cancer. Here, we show that MLN4924 is a mechanism-based inhibitor of NAE and creates a covalent NEDD8-MLN4924 adduct catalyzed by the enzyme. The NEDD8-MLN4924 adduct resembles NEDD8 adenylate, the first intermediate in the NAE reaction cycle, but cannot be further utilized in subsequent intraenzyme reactions. The stability of the NEDD8-MLN4924 adduct within the NAE active site blocks enzyme activity, thereby accounting for the potent inhibition of the NEDD8 pathway by MLN4924. Importantly, we have determined that compounds resembling MLN4924 demonstrate the ability to form analogous adducts with other ubiquitin-like proteins (UBLs) catalyzed by their cognate-activating enzymes. These findings reveal insights into the mechanism of E1s and suggest a general strategy for selective inhibition of UBL conjugation pathways. \textcopyright{} 2010 Elsevier Inc.

  abstract = {When studying biological membranes, Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations reveal to be quite complementary to experimental techniques. Because the simulated systems keep increasing both in size and complexity, the analysis of MD trajectories need to be computationally efficient while being robust enough to perform analysis on membranes that may be curved or deformed due to their size and/or protein-lipid interactions. This work presents a new software named FATSLiM ('Fast Analysis Toolbox for Simulations of Lipid Membranes') that can extract physical properties from MD simulations of membranes (with or without interacting proteins). Because it relies on the calculation of local normals, FATSLiM does not depend of the bilayer morphology and thus can handle with the same accuracy vesicles for instance. Thanks to an efficiency-driven development, it is also fast and consumes a rather low amount of memory.},

In the latter case, some suitable concrete replacement for mathematical objects is provided. Broadly speaking, there are two forms of mathematical nominalism: those views that require the reformulation of mathematical (or scientific) theories in order to avoid the commitment to mathematical objects (e.g., Field 1980; Hellman 1989), and those views that do not reformulate mathematical or scientific theories and offer instead an account of how no commitment to mathematical objects is involved when these theories are used (e.g., Azzouni 2004). Both forms of nominalism are examined, and they are assessed in light of how they address five central problems in the philosophy of mathematics (namely, problems dealing with the epistemology, the ontology, and the application of mathematics as well as the use of a uniform semantics and the proviso that mathematical and scientific theories be taken literally).},

However, almost all patients affected by ALS or tau-negative FTD share in their brains the presence of aggregated TDP-43, a nuclear factor that plays an important role in regulating RNA metabolism. For this reason, this protein represents a very promising target to develop novel therapeutic options. Over the years, these options have mostly involved the search for new effectors capable of reducing aberrant aggregation or enhancing its clearance by UPS-dependent protein quality control or autophagy system. Targeting eventual mutations in the sequence of this protein might represent a parallel alternative therapeutic option. To this date, the study of various patient populations has allowed to find more than 50 mutations associated with disease. It is, therefore, important to better understand what the functional consequences of these mutations are. As discussed in this review, the emerging picture is that most TDP-43 mutations appear to directly relate to specific disease features such as increased aggregation, half-life, or altered cellular localization and protein-protein interactions. \textcopyright{} 2015 Elsevier Inc.},

A high degree of genotypic variability was identified, and each patient had unique genotypes. Early isolates had a phenotype distinct from those of usual CF isolates: generally nonmucoid and antibiotic susceptible. Genotype and phenotype correlated between OP and BALF isolates. As determined by culture, 72.5\% of patients demonstrated P. aeruginosa during their first 3 years. On the basis of combined culture and serologic results, 97.5\% of patients had evidence of infection by age 3 years, which suggests that P. aeruginosa infection occurs early in CF and may be intermittent or undetectable by culture.},

It is based on iteratively `filling' the potential energy of the system by a sum of Gaussians centred along the trajectory followed by a suitably chosen set of collective variables (CVs), thereby forcing the system to migrate from one minimum to the next. The power of metadynamics is demonstrated by the large number of extensions and variants that have been developed. The first scope of this Technical Review is to present a critical comparison of these variants, discussing their advantages and disadvantages. The effectiveness of metadynamics, and that of the numerous alternative methods, is strongly influenced by the choice of the CVs. If an important variable is neglected, the resulting estimate of the free energy is unreliable, and predicted transition mechanisms may be qualitatively wrong. The second scope of this Technical Review is to discuss how the CVs should be selected, how to verify whether the chosen CVs are sufficient or redundant, and how to iteratively improve the CVs using machine learning approaches.},

The cilia are specialized organelles that beat in metachronal waves to propel pathogens and inhaled particles trapped in the mucous layer out of the airways. In health this clearance mechanism is effective, but in patients with primary cilia dyskinesia (PCD) the cilia are abnormal, resulting in deficient MCC and chronic lung disease. This demonstrates the critical importance of the cilia for human health. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge of the components of the MCC apparatus, focusing on the role of cilia in MCC., Ciliated cells in the lungs play a key role in mucociliary clearance, propelling inhaled particles out of the airways. Chronic diseases of the airways (e.g., primary ciliary dyskinesia) have offered insight into this process.},

  abstract = {Accurate methods to estimate free energies play an important role for studying diverse condensed-phase problems in chemistry and biochemistry. The most common methods used in conjunction with molecular dynamics (MD) and Monte Carlo statistical mechanics (MC) simulations are free energy perturbation (FEP) and thermodynamic integration (TI). For common applications featuring the conversion of one molecule to another, simulations are run in stages or multiple "{$\lambda$}-windows" to promote convergence of the results. For computation of absolute free energies of solvation or binding, calculations are needed in which the solute is typically annihilated in the solvent and in the complex. The present work addresses identification of optimal protocols for such calculations, specifically, the creation/annihilation of organic molecules in aqueous solution. As is common practice, decoupling of the perturbations for electrostatic and Lennard-Jones interactions was performed. Consistent with earlier reports, FEP calculations for molecular creations are much more efficient, while annihilations require many more windows and may converge to incorrect values. Strikingly, we find that as few as four windows may be adequate for creation calculations for solutes ranging from argon to ethylbenzene. For a larger druglike molecule, MIF180, which contains 22 non-hydrogen atoms and three rotatable bonds, 10 creation windows are found to be adequate to yield the correct free energy of hydration. Convergence is impeded with procedures that use any sampling in the annihilation direction, and there is no need for postprocessing methods such as the Bennett acceptance ratio (BAR).}

In two cases, the stenosis was found out during the removal of the cannula and in the other cases from 3 days to 8 months after the decannulation. The deffered treatment consisted in an anti-inflammatory medical treatment treatment (one case), in a permanent dilation with an Albouker tube (two cases), and in a resection of the stenosed tracheal part plus an anastomosis. Good results were obtained in 9 cases including the recovery of a satisfactory tracheal diameter. Because of a recurrence of the stenosis after resection and anastomosis, it was necessary, in two cases, to resort to another resection and, upon another occasion, to place a permanent cannulation. Finally, in one case, 2 Rethi operations were necessary to get a sub-normal tracheal diameter. From these facts, it emerges that tracheal stenosis are less important if, during the tracheotomy, a partial resection of the tracheal wall is effected (rather than an inverted U flap folded back at the bottom) together with the putting in of a cannula equipped with an elongated cylindrical cuff requiring a less important filing-up pressure (although just as efficient as far as tightness is concerned).},

Wemake use of molecular dynamics simulations of Protein L in water, in urea, and in guanidinium chloride (GdmCl) to ascertain if there are any structural differences in the associated unfolding processes. The simulation of proteins in solutions of GdmCl is complicated by the large number of charges involved, making it difficult to set up a realistic force field. Furthermore, at high concentrations of this denaturant, the motion of the solvent slows considerably. The simulations show that the unfolding mechanism depends on the denaturing agent: in urea the {$\beta$}-sheet is destabilized first, whereas in GdmCl, it is the {$\alpha$}-helix. Moreover, whereas urea interacts with the protein accumulating in the first solvation shell, GdmCl displays a longer-range electrostatic effect that does not perturb the structure of the solvent close to the protein. \textcopyright{} 2008 by the Biophysical Society.}

Recent studies have demonstrated that aerolysin is a promising candidate to improve the accuracy of DNA sequencing and to develop novel single-molecule proteomic strategies. However, the structure\textendash function relationship between the~aerolysin nanopore and its molecular sensing properties remains insufficiently explored. Herein, a set of mutated pores were rationally designed and evaluated in silico by molecular simulations and in vitro by single-channel recording and molecular translocation experiments to study the pore structural variation, ion selectivity, ionic conductance and capabilities for sensing several biomolecules. Our results show that the~ion selectivity and sensing ability of aerolysin are mostly controlled by electrostatics and the~narrow diameter of the double {$\beta$}-barrel cap. By engineering single-site mutants, a more accurate molecular detection of nucleic acids and peptides has been achieved. These findings open avenues for developing aerolysin nanopores into powerful sensing devices.},

  abstract = {Protein misfolding refers to a process where proteins become structurally abnormal and lose their specific 3-dimensional spatial configuration. The histopathological presence of misfolded protein (MP) aggregates has been associated as the primary evidence of multiple neurological diseases, including Prion diseases, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease. However, the exact mechanisms of MP aggregation and propagation, as well as their impact in the long-term patient's clinical condition are still not well understood. With this aim, a variety of mathematical models has been proposed for a better insight into the kinetic rate laws that govern the microscopic processes of protein aggregation. Complementary, another class of large-scale models rely on modern molecular imaging techniques for describing the phenomenological effects of MP propagation over the whole brain. Unfortunately, those neuroimaging-based studies do not take full advantage of the tremendous capabilities offered by the chemical kinetics modeling approach. Actually, it has been barely acknowledged that the vast majority of large-scale models have foundations on previous mathematical approaches that describe the chemical kinetics of protein replication and propagation. The purpose of the current manuscript is to present a historical review about the development of mathematical models for describing both microscopic processes that occur during the MP aggregation and large-scale events that characterize the progression of neurodegenerative MP-mediated diseases.},

However, relaxation times corresponding to reorganisation of molecular dipoles due to their interaction with electromagnetic radiation at microwave frequencies are within the scope of modern molecular simulations. In this work, fluctuations of the total dipole moment of a molecular system, obtained through molecular dynamics simulations, are used to determine the dielectric spectra of water, a series of alcohols and glycols, and monoethanolamine. Although the force fields employed in this study have principally been developed to describe thermodynamic properties, most them give fairly good predictions of this dynamical property for these systems. However, the inaccuracy of some models and the long simulation times required for the accurate estimation of the static dielectric constant can sometimes be problematic. We show that the use of the experimental value for the static dielectric constant in the calculations, instead of the one predicted by the different models, yields satisfactory results for the dielectric spectra, and hence the heat absorbed from microwaves, avoiding the need for extraordinarily long simulations or re-calibration of molecular models.},

We consider that there is plenty of room for the development of fundamental research in the field of DESs because their compositional flexibility makes the number of DESs susceptible of preparation unlimited and so do the range of properties that DESs can attain. Ultimately, these properties can be transferred into the resulting materials in terms of both tailored morphologies and compositions. Thus, interesting applications can be easily envisaged, especially in those fields in which the preparation of high-tech products via low cost processes is critical.

This study carries a critical analysis of a number of widely accepted ideas and others not so well accepted that have been repeatedly expressed in the literature concerning the CO2 physical sorption in ionic liquids. Using the CO2 solubility in eicosane as benchmark, it will be shown that there is no evidence that ILs display a physical sorption of CO2 larger than n-alkanes when analyzed in adequate concentration units; the fluorination of the ions has no impact on the CO2 solubility and the oxygenation will marginally contribute to a decrease of the solubility. Ionic liquid-based deep eutectic systems are also shown to have a poor CO2 solubility. Although these widely used approaches to physically enhance the CO2 solubility in ILs do not seem to have any positive influence, this does not mean that other types of interaction cannot provide enhanced CO2 solubility as in the case of the anion [B(CN)4] confirmed here by a critical analysis of the published data. The mechanism of CO2 physical sorption in ionic liquids is discussed based on the results analyzed, supported by spectroscopic measurements and molecular simulations previously reported and further suggestions of possibilities for enhanced physical sorption based on fluorinated aromatic rings, other cyano based anions, mixtures with other ILs or solvents or the use of porous liquids are proposed.}

Poor values for lung radiological involvement (Chrispin-Norman) and general status (Shwachman-Kulcycki) were observed in the R1066C/any mutation group (P {$<$} 0.005 and P {$<$} 0.0004). A slightly, but not significantly worse lung function was found in the R1066C/any mutation group when compared with the {$\Delta$}F508/{$\Delta$}F508 patients. No significant differences were detected regarding the age at diagnosis, sweat Cl-values, or percentiles of height and weight between the two groups. Neither were significant differences observed regarding sex, meconium ileus (4.7\% vs. 11.1\%), dehydration (10.5\% vs. 14.7\%), or pancreatic insufficiency (PI) (100\% vs. 97.8\%). The proportion of patients with lung colonization by bacterial pathogens was slightly, but not significantly higher in the R1066C/any mutation group (70.0\%), as compared with the {$\Delta$}F508/{$\Delta$}F508 group (57.5\%).

The two homozygous R1066C/R1066C patients died at the ages of 3 months and 7 years.

In addition, cells are divided into compartments limited by other membranes whose integrity and homeostasis are finely controlled, and which determine the identity and function of the different organelles. Here, we review current knowledge on membrane lipid composition in the plasma membrane and endomembrane compartments, emphasizing its role in sustaining organelle structure and function. The correct composition and structure of cell membranes define key pathophysiological aspects of cells.

  abstract = {Voltage-gated calcium (Ca2+) channels are key transducers of membrane potential changes into intracellular Ca2+ transients that initiate many physiological events. There are ten members of the voltage-gated Ca2+ channel family in mammals, and they serve distinct roles in cellular signal transduction. The CaV1 subfamily initiates contraction, secretion, regulation of gene expression, integration of synaptic input in neurons, and synaptic transmission at ribbon synapses in specialized sensory cells. The CaV2 subfamily is primarily responsible for initiation of synaptic transmission at fast synapses. The CaV3 subfamily is important for repetitive firing of action potentials in rhythmically firing cells such as cardiac myocytes and thalamic neurons. This article presents the molecular relationships and physiological functions of these Ca2+ channel proteins and provides information on their molecular, genetic, physiological, and pharmacological properties., The activity of a voltage-gated calcium channel is enhanced by the binding of an effector ready to respond to a calcium signal. This effector checkpoint mechanism may be a unifying theme in voltage-gated calcium channel regulation.},

The Hodgkin-Huxley model established a framework in which to describe the structural and functional properties of ion channels, including the mechanisms of ion permeation, selectivity, and gating. At a cellular level, the model is used to understand the conditions that control both the rate and timing of action potentials, essential for neural encoding of information. Finally, the Hodgkin-Huxley formalism is central to computational neuroscience to understand both neuronal integration and circuit level information processing, and how these mechanisms might have evolved to minimize energy cost. \textcopyright{} 2012 the authors.}

  abstract = {The goal of fundamental science at the interface of chemical sciences and biology is to understand life in chemical terms. Our ability to accomplish the translation of biology into chemical terms is closely related to our fundamental understanding of life's machinery. Decoding these mysteries and producing a detailed molecular picture of how things work is a critical step. However, for most people, the real impact comes when we can use that understanding to improve our lives. Nowhere has the role of chemical sciences been better illustrated than in the discovery, development, and production of new medicines and ways in which we can more selectively deliver these medicines to the organ or tissue where they are needed. This fundamental understanding of what chemical transformations occur in living creatures, how these chemical transformations are regulated, and how they respond to extracellular stimuli is also critical to developing semisynthetic tissues and organs as replacements for damaged organs, to gene therapy, and to solving a host of clinical problems. In addition, these chemical tools will provide the basis for improvements in the productivity of agriculture in both animal and plant production systems. Most directly, advances in the chemical sciences will be essential for the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of disease.},

At the same time, the modifications of the geometry do not affect the versatility of coupling of racetrack resonators in integrated optical circuits, which is their main advantage over ring microresonators. The proposal is applied to the design of high-\$Q\$ racetrack resonators for the silicon nitride CMOS-compatible platform having bent radii amenable for large-scale photonic integration.

The most common mutant CFTR protein in patients with cystic fibrosis, {$\Delta$}F508, is misfolded and retained by ER quality control. As oligosaccharide moieties of glycoproteins are known to mediate interactions with ER lectin chaperones, we investigated the role of N-linked glycosylation in the processing of wild-type and {$\Delta$}F508 CFTR. We found that N-glycosylation and ER lectin interactions are not major determinants of trafficking of wild-type and {$\Delta$}F508 from the ER to the plasma membrane. Unglycosylated CFTR, generated by removal of glycosylation sites or treatment of cells with the N-glycosylation inhibitor tunicamycin, did not bind calnexin, but did traffic to the cell surface and exhibited chloride channel activity. Most importantly, unglycosylated {$\Delta$}F508 CFTR still could not escape quality control in the early secretory pathway and remained associated with the ER. However, the absence of N-linked oligosaccharides did reduce the stability of wild-type CFTR, causing significantly more-rapid turnover in post-ER compartments. Surprisingly, the individual N-linked carbohydrates do not play equivalent roles and modulate the fate of the wild-type protein in different ways in its early biosynthetic pathway.},

Scalar activity was introduced by increasing the temperature of half of the particles (labeled `hot') while keeping the temperature of the other half constant at a lower value (labeled `cold'). The relative temperature difference between the two subsystems is considered as a measure of the activity. From our simulations we observe that the two species tend to phase separate at sufficiently high activity ratio. The extent of separation is quantified by the defined order parameter and the entropy production during this process is determined by employing the two-phase thermodynamic (2PT) model and the standard modified Benedict\textendash Webb\textendash Rubin (MBWR) equation of state for a LJ fluid. We observe that the extent of the phase separation and entropy production increases with the density of the system. From a cluster analysis, we obtain the mean number of clusters {$\langle$}               n               cl               {$\rangle$}, and the mean size of the largest cluster {$\langle$}               n               0               {$\rangle$} in the system, complementing each other.

Previously we have studied the energetics of dissociation in a potassium channel-charybdotoxin complex by using umbrella sampling molecular-dynamics simulations, and established the need for carefully chosen coordinates and restraints to maintain the physiological ligand conformation. Here we address the ligand integrity problem further by constructing additional potential of mean forces for dissociation of charybdotoxin using restraints. We show that the large discrepancies in binding free energy arising from simulation artifacts can be avoided by using appropriate restraints on the ligand, which enables determination of the binding free energy within the chemical accuracy. We make several suggestions for optimal choices of harmonic potential parameters and restraints to be used in binding studies of large ligands. \textcopyright{} 2011 by the Biophysical Society.},

The functional core complex consists of mTOR, mLST8, and two mTORC2-specific components, Rictor and mSin1. Here we investigated the intermolecular interactions within mTORC2 complex and determined its cryo-electron microscopy structure at 4.9\,\AA{} resolution. The structure reveals a hollow rhombohedral fold with a 2-fold symmetry. The dimerized mTOR serves as a scaffold for the complex assembly. The N-terminal half of Rictor is composed of helical repeat clusters and binds to mTOR through multiple contacts. mSin1 is located close to the FRB domain and catalytic cavity of mTOR. Rictor and mSin1 together generate steric hindrance to inhibit binding of FKBP12-rapamycin to mTOR, revealing the mechanism for rapamycin insensitivity of mTORC2. The mTOR dimer in mTORC2 shows more compact conformation than that of mTORC1 (rapamycin sensitive), which might result from the interaction between mTOR and Rictor-mSin1. Structural comparison shows that binding of Rictor and Raptor (mTORC1-specific component) to mTOR is mutually exclusive. Our study provides a basis for understanding the assembly of mTORC2 and a framework to further characterize the regulatory mechanism of mTORC2 pathway.},

SANS may provide multiple independent data sets by means of contrast variation experiments, that is, by measuring at different D2O concentrations and different perdeuteration conditions of the biomolecular complex. However, even the combined data from multiple SAXS/SANS sets is by far insufficient to define all degrees of freedom of a complex, leading to a significant risk of overfitting when refining biomolecular structures against SAXS/SANS data. Hence, to control against overfitting, the low-information SAXS/SANS data must be complemented by accurate physical models, and, if possible, refined models should be cross-validated against independent data not used during the refinement. We present a method for refining atomic biomolecular structures against multiple sets of SAXS and SANS data using all-atom molecular dynamics simulations. Using the protein citrate synthase and the protein/RNA complex Sxl-Unr-msl2 mRNA as test cases, we demonstrate how multiple SAXS and SANS sets may be used for refinement and cross-validation, thereby excluding overfitting during refinement. For the Sxl-Unr-msl2 complex, we find that perdeuteration of the Unr domain leads to a unique, slightly compacted conformation, whereas other perdeuteration conditions lead to similar solution conformations compared to the nondeuterated state. In line with our previous method for predicting SAXS curves, SANS curves were predicted with explicit-solvent calculations, taking atomic models for both the hydration layer and the excluded solvent into account, thereby avoiding the use of solvent-related fitting parameters and solvent-reduced neutron scattering lengths. We expect the method to be useful for deriving and validating solution structures of biomolecules and soft-matter complexes, and for critically assessing whether multiple SAXS and SANS sets are mutually compatible.}

Glutamate transporters also conduct chloride ions by means of a channel-like process that is thermodynamically uncoupled from transport6\textendash 8. However, the molecular mechanisms that enable these dual-function transporters to carry out two seemingly contradictory roles are unknown. Here we report the cryo-electron microscopy structure of a glutamate transporter homologue in an open-channel state, which reveals an aqueous cavity that is formed during the glutamate transport cycle. The functional properties of this cavity, combined with molecular dynamics simulations, reveal it to be an aqueous-accessible chloride permeation pathway that is gated by two hydrophobic regions and is conserved across mammalian and archaeal glutamate transporters. Our findings provide insight into the mechanism by which glutamate transporters support their dual function, and add information that will assist in mapping the complete transport cycle shared by the solute carrier 1A transporter family.},

In this work, we report the full ORR reaction mechanism for Pt(111) based on Quantum Mechanics (QM) based Reactive metadynamics (R{$\mu$}D) simulations including explicit water to obtain free energy reaction barriers at 298 K. The lowest energy pathway for 4 e- water formation is: first, *OOH formation; second, *OOH reduction to H2O and O*; third, O* hydrolysis using surface water to produce two *OH and finally *OH hydration to water. Water formation is the rate-determining step (RDS) for potentials above 0.87 Volt, the normal operating range. Considering the Eley\textendash Rideal (ER) mechanism involving protons from the solvent, we predict the free energy reaction barrier at 298 K for water formation to be 0.25 eV for an external potential below U = 0.87 V and 0.41 eV at U = 1.23 V, in good agreement with experimental values of 0.22 eV and 0.44 eV, respectively.

Interestingly, despite predictions based on channel activity measurements in biological membranes, the structure of the detergent purified, phosphorylated, and ATP-bound human CFTR protein did not reveal a stably open conduction pathway. This study tested the hypothesis that the functional properties of the detergent solubilized CFTR protein used for structural determinations are different from those exhibited by CFTR purified under conditions that retain associated lipids native to the membrane. It was found that CFTR purified together with phospholipids and cholesterol using amphipol: A8-35, exhibited higher rates of catalytic activity, phosphorylation dependent channel activation and potentiation by the therapeutic compound, ivacaftor, than did CFTR purified in detergent. The catalytic activity of phosphorylated CFTR detergent micelles was rescued by the addition of phospholipids plus cholesterol, but not by phospholipids alone, arguing for a specific role for cholesterol in modulating this function. In summary, these studies highlight the importance of lipid interactions in the intrinsic activities and pharmacological potentiation of CFTR.},

  abstract = {Folding funnel is the essential concept of the free energy landscape for ordered proteins. How does this concept apply to intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs)? Here, we address this fundamental question through the explicit characterization of the free energy landscapes of the representative {$\alpha$}-helical (HP-35) and {$\beta$}-sheet (WW domain) proteins and of an IDP (pKID) that folds upon binding to its partner (KIX). We demonstrate that HP-35 and WW domain indeed exhibit the steep folding funnel: the landscape slope for these proteins is ca. -50 kcal/mol, meaning that the free energy decreases by \textasciitilde 5 kcal/mol upon the formation of 10\% native contacts. On the other hand, the landscape of pKID is funneled but considerably shallower (slope of -24 kcal/mol), which explains why pKID is disordered in free environments. Upon binding to KIX, the landscape of pKID now becomes significantly steep (slope of -54 kcal/mol), which enables otherwise disordered pKID to fold. We also show that it is the pKID\textendash KIX intermolecular interactions originating from hydrophobic residues that mainly confer the steep folding funnel. The present work not only provides the quantitative characterization of the protein folding free energy landscape, but also establishes the usefulness of the folding funnel concept to IDPs.},

  abstract = {Enterobacteriaceae produce antimicrobial peptides for survival under nutrient starvation. Microcin J25 (MccJ25) is an antimicrobial peptide with a unique lasso topology. It is secreted by the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) exporter McjD, which ensures self-immunity of the producing strain through efficient export of the toxic mature peptide from the cell. Here we have determined the crystal structure of McjD from Escherichia coli at 2.7-\AA{} resolution, which is to the authors' knowledge the first structure of an antibacterial peptide ABC transporter. Our functional and biochemical analyses demonstrate McjD-dependent immunity to MccJ25 through efflux of the peptide. McjD can directly bind MccJ25 and displays a basal ATPase activity that is stimulated by MccJ25 in both detergent solution and proteoliposomes. McjD adopts a new conformation, termed nucleotide-bound outward occluded. The new conformation defines a clear cavity; mutagenesis and ligand binding studies of the cavity have identified Phe86, Asn134, and Asn302 as important for recognition of MccJ25. Comparisons with the inward-open MsbA and outward-open Sav1866 structures show that McjD has structural similarities with both states without the intertwining of transmembrane (TM) helices. The occluded state is formed by rotation of TMs 1 and 2 toward the equivalent TMs of the opposite monomer, unlike Sav1866 where they intertwine with TMs 3-6 of the opposite monomer. Cysteine cross-linking studies on the McjD dimer in inside-out membrane vesicles of E. coli confirmed the presence of the occluded state. We therefore propose that the outward-occluded state represents a transition intermediate between the outward-open and inward-open conformation of ABC exporters.},

Several assays have been developed, such as forskolin-induced swelling (FIS), to evaluate the rescue of such uncommon CFTR alleles both by established and novel modulators in patient-derived primary cell cultures (organoids). Presently, we assessed the CFTR-mediated electrical current across rectal organoid-derived epithelial monolayers. This technique, which allows separate measurement of CFTR-dependent chloride or bicarbonate transport, was used to assess the effect of ELX/TEZ/IVA on two rare CFTR variants. METHODS Intestinal organoid cultures were established from rectal biopsies of CF patients carrying the rare missense mutations E193K or R334W paired with F508del. The effect of the CFTR modulator combination ELX/TEZ/IVA on CFTR-mediated Cl- and HCO3- secretion was assessed in organoid-derived intestinal epithelial monolayers. Non-CF organoids were used for comparison. Clinical biomarkers (sweat chloride, FEV1) were monitored in patients receiving modulator therapy. RESULTS ELX/TEZ/IVA markedly enhanced CFTR-mediated bicarbonate and chloride transport across intestinal epithelium of both patients. Consistent with the rescue of CFTR function in cultured intestinal cells, ELX/TEZ/IVA therapy improved biomarkers of CFTR function in the R334W/F508del patient. CONCLUSIONS Current measurements in organoid-derived intestinal monolayers can readily be used to monitor CFTR-dependent epithelial Cl- and HCO3- transport. This technique can be explored to assess the functional consequences of rare CFTR mutations and the efficacy of CFTR modulators. We propose that this functional CFTR assay may guide personalized medicine in patients with CF-like clinical manifestations as well as in those carrying rare CFTR mutations.},

The aim of this study was to determine the mechanism of dysfunction of a disease-causing mutation associated with variable phenotypes. In order to attain these objectives, we studied the effect of the p.L206W mutation on CFTR protein production and function, and we examined the genotype-phenotype correlation of [p.L206W] + [p.F508del] patients. We showed that p.L206W is a processing (class II) mutation since the CFTR biosynthetic pathway was severely impaired, whereas single-channel measurements indicated ion conductance similar to the wild-type protein. These data raise the larger question of the phenotypic variability of class II mutants, including p.F508del. Since multiple potential partners could modify the processing of the CFTR protein during its course to the cell surface, environmental and other genetic factors might contribute to this variability. \textcopyright{} 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

We piloted multicenter standard operating procedures (SOPs) to detect CFTR activity by ICM and examined key questions for use in clinical trials. SOPs for ICM using human rectal biopsies were developed across three centers and used to characterize ion transport from non-CF and CF subjects (two severe CFTR mutations). All data were centrally evaluated by a blinded interpreter. SOPs were then used across four centers to examine the effect of cold storage on CFTR currents and compare CFTR currents in biopsies from one subject studied simultaneously either at two sites (24 hours post-biopsy) or when biopsies were obtained by either forceps or suction. Rectal biopsies from 44 non-CF and 17 CF subjects were analyzed. Mean differences ({$\mu$}A/cm2; 95\% confidence intervals) between CF and non-CF were forskolin/IBMX=102.6(128.0 to 81.1), carbachol=96.3(118.7 to 73.9), forskolin/IBMX+carbachol=200.9(243.1 to 158.6), and bumetanide=-44.6 (-33.7 to -55.6) (P{$<$}0.005, CF vs non-CF for all parameters). Receiver Operating Characteristic curves indicated that each parameter discriminated CF from non-CF subjects (area under the curve of 0.94-0.98). CFTR dependent currents following 18-24 hours of cold storage for forskolin/IBMX, carbachol, and forskolin/IBMX+carbachol stimulation (n=17 non-CF subjects) were 44\%, 47.5\%, and 47.3\%, respectively of those in fresh biopsies. CFTR-dependent currents from biopsies studied after cold storage at two sites simultaneously demonstrated moderate correlation (n=14 non-CF subjects, Pearson correlation coefficients 0.389, 0.484, and 0.533). Similar CFTR dependent currents were detected from fresh biopsies obtained by either forceps or suction (within-subject comparisons, n=22 biopsies from three non-CF subjects). Multicenter ICM is a feasible CFTR outcome measure that discriminates CF from non-CF ion transport, offers unique advantages over other CFTR bioassays, and warrants further development as a potential CFTR biomarker. \textcopyright{} 2013 Clancy et al.},

METHODS: The Cystic Fibrosis Foundation (CFF) assembled a workshop of international experts to discuss the use of preclinical model systems to examine the nature of CF-causing variants in CFTR and the role of in vitro CFTR modulator testing to inform in vivo modulator use. The theme of the workshop was centered on CFTR theratyping, a term that encompasses the use of CFTR modulators to define defects in CFTR in vitro, with application to both common and rare CFTR variants. RESULTS: Several preclinical model systems were identified in various stages of maturity, ranging from the expression of CFTR variant cDNA in stable cell lines to examination of cells derived from CF patients, including the gastrointestinal tract, the respiratory tree, and the blood. Common themes included the ongoing need for standardization, validation, and defining the predictive capacity of data derived from model systems to estimate clinical outcomes from modulator-treated CF patients. CONCLUSIONS: CFTR modulator theratyping is a novel and rapidly evolving field that has the potential to identify rare CFTR variants that are responsive to approved drugs or drugs in development.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Microarray studies related to cystic fibrosis (CF) airway gene expression have gone some way in clarifying the complex molecular background of CF lung diseases, but have made little progress in defining a robust "molecular signature" associated with mutant CFTR expression. Disparate methodological and statistical analyses complicate comparisons between independent studies of the CF transcriptome, and although each study may be valid in isolation, the conclusions reached differ widely. METHODS: We carried out a small-scale whole genome microarray study of gene expression in human native nasal epithelial cells from F508del-CFTR homozygotes in comparison to non-CF controls. We performed superficial comparisons with other microarray datasets in an attempt to identify a subset of regulated genes that could act as a signature of F508del-CFTR expression in native airway tissue samples. RESULTS: Among the alterations detected in CF, up-regulation of genes involved in cell proliferation, and down-regulation of cilia genes were the most notable. Other changes involved gene expression changes in calcium and membrane pathways, inflammation, defence response, wound healing and the involvement of estrogen signalling. Comparison of our data set with previously published studies allowed us to assess the consistency of independent microarray data sets, and shed light on the limitations of such snapshot studies in measuring a system as subtle and dynamic as the transcriptome. Comparison of in-vivo studies nevertheless yielded a small molecular CF signature worthy of future investigation. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the variability among the independent studies, the current CF transcriptome meta-analysis identified subsets of differentially expressed genes in native airway tissues which provide both interesting clues to CF pathogenesis and a possible CF biomarker.},

  abstract = {In the host of numerical schemes devised to calculate free energy differences by way of geometric transformations, the adaptive biasing force algorithm has emerged as a promising route to map complex free-energy landscapes. It relies upon the simple concept that as a simulation progresses, a continuously updated biasing force is added to the equations of motion, such that in the long-time limit it yields a Hamiltonian devoid of an average force acting along the transition coordinate of interest. This means that sampling proceeds uniformly on a flat free-energy surface, thus providing reliable free-energy estimates. Much of the appeal of the algorithm to the practitioner is in its physically intuitive underlying ideas and the absence of any requirements for prior knowledge about free-energy landscapes. Since its inception in 2001, the adaptive biasing force scheme has been the subject of considerable attention, from in-depth mathematical analysis of convergence properties to novel developments and extensions. The method has also been successfully applied to many challenging problems in chemistry and biology. In this contribution, the method is presented in a comprehensive, self-contained fashion, discussing with a critical eye its properties, applicability, and inherent limitations, as well as introducing novel extensions. Through free-energy calculations of prototypical molecular systems, many methodological aspects are examined, from stratification strategies to overcoming the so-called hidden barriers in orthogonal space, relevant not only to the adaptive biasing force algorithm but also to other importance-sampling schemes. On the basis of the discussions in this paper, a number of good practices for improving the efficiency and reliability of the computed free-energy differences are proposed.},

The first person to use the word "geography" was Eratosthenes (276-194 BC). Four historical traditions in geographical research are the spatial analysis of the natural and the human phenomena (geography as the study of distribution), the area studies (places and regions), the study of the man-land relationship, and the research in the earth sciences.[3] Nonetheless, the modern geography is an all-encompassing discipline that foremost seeks to understand the Earth and all of its human and natural complexities\textemdash not merely where objects are, but how they have changed and come to be. Geography has been called "the world discipline" and "the bridge between the human and the physical science". Geography is divided into two main branches: the human geography and the physical geography.[4][5][6]},

Normally these materials are prepared hydrothermally with water as the solvent in a sealed autodave under autogenous pressure. The reaction mixture usually includes an organic template or structure-directing agent' that guides the synthesis pathway towards particular structures. Here we report the preparation of aluminophosphate zeolite analogues by using ionic liquids and eutectic mixtures. An imidazolium-based ionic liquid acts as both solvent and template, leading to four zeotype frameworks under different experimental conditions. The structural characteristics of the materials can be traced back to the solvent chemistry used. Because of the vanishingly low vapour pressure of ionic liquids, synthesis takes place at ambient pressure, eliminating safety concerns associated with high hydrothermal pressures. The ionic liquid can also be recycled for further use. A choline chloride/urea eutectic mixtures is also used in the preparation of a new zeotype framework.}

Many SNARE complexes contain two t-SNAREs that form a heterodimer, a putative intermediate in SNARE assembly. Individual t-SNAREs (e.g., syntaxin 1A) also regulate synaptic calcium channels and cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), the epithelial chloride channel that is defective in cystic fibrosis. Whether the regulation of ion channels by individual t-SNAREs is related to SNARE complex assembly and membrane fusion is unknown. Here we show that CFTR channels are coordinately regulated by two cognate t-SNAREs, SNAP-23 (synaptosome-associated protein of 23 kDa) and syntaxin 1A. SNAP-23 physically associates with CFTR by binding to its amino-terminal tail, a region that modulates channel gating. CFTR-mediated chloride currents are inhibited by introducing excess SNAP-23 into HT29-Cl.19A epithelial cells. Conversely, CFTR activity is stimulated by a SNAP-23 antibody that blocks the binding of this t-SNARE to the CFTR amino-terminal tail. The physical and functional interactions between SNAP-23 and CFTR depend on syntaxin 1A, which binds to both proteins. We conclude that CFTR channels are regulated by a t-SNARE complex that may tune CFTR activity to rates of membrane traffic in epithelial cells.},

This effective two-body force field is the successor to the Weiner et al. force field and was developed with some of the same philosophies, such as the use of a simple diagonal potential function and electrostatic potential fit atom centered charges. The need for a 10-12 function for representing hydrogen bonds is no longer necessary due to the improved performance of the new charge model and new van der Waals parameters. These new charges are determined using a 6-31G* basis set and restrained electrostatic potential (RESP) fitting and have been shown to reproduce interaction energies, free energies of solvation, and conformational energies of simple small molecules to a good degree of accuracy. Furthermore, the new RESP charges exhibit less variability as a function of the molecular conformation used in the charge determination. The new van der Waals parameters have been derived from liquid simulations and include hydrogen parameters which take into account the effects of any geminal electronegative atoms. The bonded parameters developed by Weiner et al. were modified as necessary to reproduce experimental vibrational frequencies and structures. Most of the simple dihedral parameters have been retained from Weiner et al., but a complex set of and parameters which do a good job of reproducing the energies of the low-energy conformations of glycyl and alanyl dipeptides has been developed for the peptide backbone.},

  abstract = {The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is an ion channel that regulates the flow of anions across epithelia. Mutations in CFTR cause cystic fibrosis. CFTR belongs to the ATP-binding cassette transporter superfamily, and gating is controlled by phosphorylation and ATP binding and hydrolysis. Recently obtained ATP-free and ATP-bound structures of zebrafish CFTR revealed an unwound segment of transmembrane helix (TM) 8, which appears to be a unique feature of CFTR not present in other ATP-binding cassette transporter structures. Here, using {$\mu$}s-long molecular dynamics simulations, we investigate the interactions formed by this TM8 segment with nearby helices in both ATP-free and ATP-bound states. We highlight ATP-dependent interactions as well as the structural role of TM8 in maintaining the functional architecture of the pore via interactions common to both the ATP-bound and ATP-free state. The results of the molecular dynamics simulations are discussed in the context of the gating mechanism of CFTR.}

Equivalence of the two theories in bulk situations is demonstrated in a control study. In simple cylindrical channels, considerable differences are found between the two theories with regard to the concentration profiles in the channel and its conductance properties. These differences are at a maximum in narrow channels with a radius smaller than the Debye length and diminish with increasing radius. Convergence occurs when the channel radius is over 2 Debye lengths. These tests unequivocally demonstrate that the mean- field approximation in the Poisson-Nernst-Planck theory breaks down in narrow ion channels that have radii smaller than the Debye length.},

These compounds are potentially disease modifying but are only available to certain patient subsets based on genotype. This review discusses the role of theratyping in CF and the potential to assess all patients' response to current and emerging therapies. RECENT FINDINGS: There are limitations to treatment determined by mutation, as variable clinical response to CFTR modulators has been observed within the same genotype. Patients with rare mutations not currently licensed for CFTR modulator therapy have demonstrated response to these medications. Patient-specific cellular models called organoids can be used to demonstrate response to different CFTR modulators in vitro prior to their clinical application and represent a method of theratyping. SUMMARY: Theratyping charts patients' clinical response to different treatments on an individual basis. This overcomes the limitations of genotype being used to predict response to individual therapies and includes all patients regardless of mutation. The use of organoids in high throughput screening allows numerous compounds to be tested on patient-specific tissue preclinically. This could lead to the extension of theratyping beyond CFTR modulators.},

  abstract = {Opening and closing of a CFTR Cl- channel is controlled by PKA-mediated phosphorylation of its cytoplasmic regulatory (R) domain and by ATP binding, and likely hydrolysis, at its two nucleotide binding domains. Functional interactions between the R domain and the two nucleotide binding domains were probed by characterizing the gating of severed CFTR channels expressed in Xenopus oocytes. Expression levels were assessed using measurements of oocyte conductance, and detailed functional characteristics of the channels were extracted from kinetic analyses of macroscopic current relaxations and of single-channel gating events in membrane patches excised from the oocytes. The kinetic behavior of wild-type (WT) CFTR channels was compared with that of split CFTR channels bearing a single cut (between residues 633 and 634) just before the R domain, of split channels with a single cut (between residues 835 and 837) just after the R domain, and of split channels from which the entire R domain (residues 634\textendash 836) between those two cut sites was omitted. The channels cut before the R domain had characteristics almost identical to those of WT channels, except for less than twofold shorter open burst durations in the presence of PKA. Channels cut just after the R domain were characterized by a low level of activity even without phosphorylation, strong stimulation by PKA, enhanced apparent affinity for ATP as assayed by open probability, and a somewhat destabilized binding site for the locking action of the nonhydrolyzable ATP analog AMPPNP. Split channels with no R domain (from coexpression of CFTR segments 1\textendash 633 and 837\textendash 1480) were highly active without phosphorylation, but otherwise displayed the characteristics of channels cut after the R domain, including higher apparent ATP affinity, and less tight binding of AMPPNP at the locking site, than for WT. Intriguingly, severed channels with no R domain were still noticeably stimulated by PKA, implying that activation of WT CFTR by PKA likely also includes some component unrelated to the R domain. As the maximal opening rates were the same for WT channels and split channels with no R domain, it seems that the phosphorylated R domain does not stimulate opening of CFTR channels; rather, the dephosphorylated R domain inhibits them.},

CFTR is activated by protein kinase A (PKA)-mediated phosphorylation of multiple sites in its regulatory domain, and gated by binding and hydrolysis of ATP at its two nucleotide binding domains (NBD1, NBD2). The recent crystal structure of NBD1 from mouse CFTR (Lews, H.A., S.G. Buchanan, S.K. Burley, K. Conners, M. Dickey, M. Dorwart, R. Fowler, X. Gao, W.B. Guggino, W.A. Hendrickson, et al. 2004. EMBO J. 23: 282-293) identified two regions absent from structures of all other NBDs determined so far, a "regulatory insertion" (residues 404-435) and a "regulatory extension" (residues 639-670), both positioned to impede formation of the putative NBD1-NBD2 dimer anticipated to occur during channel gating; as both segments appeared highly mobile and both contained consensus PKA sites (serine 422, and serines 660 and 670, respectively), it was suggested that their phosphorylation-linked conformational changes might underlie CFTR channel regulation. To test that suggestion, we coexpressed in Xenopus oocytes CFTR residues 1-414 with residues 433-1480, or residues 1-633 with 668-1480, to yield split CFTR channels (called 414+433 and 633+668) that lack most of the insertion, or extension, respectively. In excised patches, regulation of the resulting CFTR channels by PKA and by ATP was largely normal. Both 414+433 channels and 633+668 channels, as well as 633(S422A)+668 channels (lacking both the extension and the sole PKA consensus site in the insertion), were all shut during exposure to MgATP before addition of PKA, but activated like wild type (WT) upon phosphorylation; this indicates that inhibitory regulation of nonphosphorylated WT channels depends upon neither segment. Detailed kinetic analysis of 414+433 channels revealed intact ATP dependence of single-channel gating kinetics, but slightly shortened open bursts and faster closing from the locked-open state (elicited by ATP plus pyrophosphate or ATP plus AMPPNP). In contrast, 633+668 channel function was indistinguishable from WT at both macroscopic and microscopic levels. We conclude that neither nonconserved segment is an essential element of PKA- or nucleotide-dependent regulation.},

  abstract = {By tracking conformational transitions of individual ion channel proteins, single-channel recordings allow the observer to deduce gating mechanisms, as well as estimate rate constants of microscopic gating steps. For most ion channels, gating mechanisms are complex, comprising multiple stable open (O) and closed (C) conformations among which conformational transitions may follow a network of possible kinetic pathways. The ensemble of all states and the connectivities among them are called a gating scheme. The strictest limitation to deciphering complex gating schemes is the fact that only transitions between closed and open states can be detected, whereas transitions among closed states, or among open states, remain invisible in single-channel current traces. It is true that such silent transitions are betrayed by the shapes of the dwell-time distributions, which carry information both on the numbers of closed and open states and on the magnitudes of the rate constants of ``invisible'' transitions (Colquhoun and Hawkes, 1981). But in practice, extracting such information is not at all straightforward: whereas fitting a mechanism to the data by maximum likelihood is a convenient way for estimating rate constants once the underlying gating scheme is known, deciphering the mechanism itself is a much harder task. Typically, several alternative schemes provide satisfactory fits, and comparison of log-likelihood scores facilitates the choice among models only under specific circumstances (when one model is a subset of the other). Thus, clearly, rendering an invisible transition as directly observable in a single-channel current trace is extremely informative for addressing mechanisms. In the previous issue of The Journal of General Physiology, Zhang and Hwang exploit mutants in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) chloride channel that allow visualization of a normally invisible gating transition. In doing so, they reveal a role for the internal vestibule of the channel in gating.},

  abstract = {Arginine 352 (R352) in the sixth transmembrane domain of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) previously was reported to form an anion/cation selectivity filter and to provide positive charge in the intracellular vestibule. However, mutations at this site have nonspecific effects, such as inducing susceptibility of endogenous cysteines to chemical modification. We hypothesized that R352 stabilizes channel structure and that charge-destroying mutations at this site disrupt pore architecture, with multiple consequences. We tested the effects of mutations at R352 on conductance, anion selectivity and block by the sulfonylurea drug glipizide, using recordings of wild-type and mutant channels. Charge-altering mutations at R352 destabilized the open state and altered both selectivity and block. In contrast, R352K-CFTR was similar to wild-type. Full conductance state amplitude was similar to that of wild-type CFTR in all mutants except R352E, suggesting that R352 does not itself form an anion coordination site. In an attempt to identify an acidic residue that may interact with R352, we found that permeation properties were similarly affected by charge-reversing mutations at D993. Wild-type-like properties were rescued in R352E/D993R-CFTR, suggesting that R352 and D993 in the wild-type channel may interact to stabilize pore architecture. Finally, R352A-CFTR was sensitive to modification by externally applied MTSEA+, while wild-type and R352E/D993R-CFTR were not. These data suggest that R352 plays an important structural role in CFTR, perhaps reflecting its involvement in forming a salt bridge with residue D993. \textcopyright{} 2008 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

After sensing Ca2+ store depletion in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) lumen, STIM1 (STromal Interaction Molecule 1) oligomerizes and then interacts with and activates the Orai1 calcium channel. Our previous research has demonstrated that the inhibitory helix (IH) adjacent to the first coiled-coil region (CC1) of STIM1 may keep the whole C-terminus of STIM1 in an inactive state. However, the specific conformational change of CC1-IH that drives the transition of STIM1 from the resting state to the active state remains elusive. Herein, we report the structural analysis of CC1-IH, which revealed that the entire CC1-IH molecule forms a very long helix. Structural and biochemical analyses indicated that IH, and not the CC1 region, contributes to the oligomerization of STIM1. Small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) analysis suggested that the C-terminus of STIM1 including the IH region displays a collapsed conformation, whereas the construct without the IH region has an extended conformation. These two conformations may correspond to the conformational states of the C-terminus of STIM1 before and after activation.

  abstract = {Previous studies have identified two salt bridges in human CFTR chloride ion channels, Arg352-Asp993 and Arg347-Asp 924, that are required for normal channel function. In the present study, we determined how the two salt bridges cooperate to maintain the open pore architecture of CFTR. Our data suggest that Arg347 not only interacts with Asp924 but also interacts with Asp993. The tripartite interaction Arg347-Asp924-Asp993 mainly contributes to maintaining a stable s2 open subconductance state. The Arg352-Asp993 salt bridge, in contrast, is involved in stabilizing both the s2 and full (f) open conductance states, with the main contribution being to the f state. The s1 subconductance state does not require either salt bridge. In confirmation of the role of Arg352 and Asp993, channels bearing cysteines at these sites could be latched into a full open state using the bifunctional cross-linker 1,2-ethanediyl bismethanethiosulfonate, but only when applied in the open state. Channels remained latched open even after washout of ATP. The results suggest that these interacting residues contribute differently to stabilizing the open pore in different phases of the gating cycle. \textcopyright{} 2013 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.},

  abstract = {The cystic fibrosis (CF) transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) bears six extracellular loops (ECL1-6); ECL1 is the site of several mutations associated with CF. Mutation R117H has been reported to reduce current amplitude, whereas D110H, E116K, and R117C/L/P may impair channel stability. We hypothesized that these amino acids might not be directly involved in ion conduction and permeation but may contribute to stabilizing the outer vestibule architecture in CFTR. We used cRNA injected oocytes combined with electrophysiological techniques to test this hypothesis. Mutants bearing cysteine at these sites were not functionally modified by extracellular MTS reagents and were blocked by GlyH-101 similarly to WT-CFTR. These results suggest that these three residues do not contribute directly to permeation in CFTR. In contrast, mutants D110R-, E116R-, and R117A-CFTR exhibited instability of the open state and significantly shortened burst duration compared with WT-CFTR and failed to be locked into the open state by AMP-PNP (adenosine 5'-(\ss,{$\gamma$}-imido) triphosphate); charge-retaining mutants showed mainly the full open state with comparably longer open burst duration. These interactions suggest that these ECL1 residues might be involved in maintaining the outer pore architecture of CFTR. A CFTR homology model suggested that E116 interacts with R104 in both the closed and open states, D110 interacts with K892 in the fully closed state, and R117 interacts with E1126 in the open state. These interactions were confirmed experimentally. The results suggest that D110, E116, and R117 may contribute to stabilizing the architecture of the outer pore of CFTR by interactions with other charged residues. \textcopyright{} 2014 Cui et al.}

VX-770 potentiated wildtype CFTR and several disease mutants expressed in oocytes in a manner modulated by PKA-mediated phosphorylation. Potentiation of some other mutants, including G551D-CFTR, was less dependent upon the level of phosphorylation, likely related to the severe gating defects in these mutants exhibited in part by a shift in PKA sensitivity to activation, possibly due to an electrostatic interaction of D551 with K1250. Phosphorylation-dependent potentiation of wildtype CFTR and other variants also was observed in epithelial cells. Hence, the efficacy of potentiators may be obscured by a ceiling effect when drug screening is performed under strongly phosphorylating conditions. These results should be considered in campaigns for CFTR potentiator discovery, and may enable the expansion of VX-770 to CF patients bearing ultra-orphan CFTR mutations.},

However, the identification of an early CFTR ortholog with altered structure or function would provide critical insight into the evolution of epithelial anion transport. Here, we describe the earliest known CFTR, expressed in sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus), with unique structural features, altered kinetics of activation and sensitivity to inhibition, and altered single-channel conductance compared to human CFTR. Our data provide the earliest evolutionary evidence of CFTR, offering insight regarding changes in gene and protein structure that underpin evolution from transporter to anion channel.

  abstract = {The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is an epithelial chloride channel mutated in patients with cystic fibrosis. Its expression and functional interactions in the apical membrane are regulated by several PDZ (PSD-95, discs large, zonula occludens-1) proteins, which mediate protein-protein interactions, typically by binding C-terminal recognition motifs. In particular, the CFTR-associated ligand (CAL) limits cell-surface levels of the most common disease-associated mutant DeltaF508-CFTR. CAL also mediates degradation of wild-type CFTR, targeting it to lysosomes following endocytosis. Nevertheless, wild-type CFTR survives numerous cycles of uptake and recycling. In doing so, how does it repeatedly avoid CAL-mediated degradation? One mechanism may involve competition between CAL and other PDZ proteins including Na (+)/H (+) exchanger-3 regulatory factors 1 and 2 (NHERF1 and NHERF2), which functionally stabilize cell-surface CFTR. Thus, to understand the biochemical basis of WT-CFTR persistence, we need to know the relative affinities of these partners. However, no quantitative binding data are available for CAL or the individual NHERF2 PDZ domains, and published estimates for the NHERF1 PDZ domains conflict. Here we demonstrate that the affinity of the CAL PDZ domain for the CFTR C-terminus is much weaker than those of NHERF1 and NHERF2 domains, enabling wild-type CFTR to avoid premature entrapment in the lysosomal pathway. At the same time, CAL's affinity is evidently sufficient to capture and degrade more rapidly cycling mutants, such as DeltaF508-CFTR. The relatively weak affinity of the CAL:CFTR interaction may provide a pharmacological window for stabilizing rescued DeltaF508-CFTR in patients with cystic fibrosis.},

The objectives of this systematic review were to summarize real-world AEs reported for market-available CFTR modulators (i.e., ivacaftor (IVA), lumacaftor/ivacaftor (LUM/IVA), tezacaftor/ivacaftor (TEZ/IVA), and elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor (ELX/TEZ/IVA)), and to identify ways in which the pharmacist on CF healthcare teams may contribute to mitigating and managing these AEs. The MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and Web of Science Core Collection online databases were searched from 2012 to 1 Aug 2020. Full manuscripts or conference abstracts of observational studies, case series, and case reports were eligible for inclusion. The included full manuscripts and conference abstracts comprised of 54 observational studies, 5 case series, and 9 case reports. The types of AEs reported generally aligned with what have been observed in clinical trials. LUM/IVA was associated with a higher frequency of respiratory-related AE and discontinuation in real-world studies. A signal for mental health and neurocognitive AEs was identified with all 4 CFTR modulators. A systematic approach to monitoring for AEs in people with CF on CFTR modulators in the real-world setting is necessary to help better understand potential AEs, as well as patient characteristics that may be associated with higher risk of certain AEs. Pharmacists play a key role in the safe initiation and monitoring of people with CF on CFTR modulator therapies.},

Disruption of CFTR function is associated with cystic fibrosis making it an attractive therapeutic target. In addition, CFTR blockers are being developed as potential antidiarrheals. CFTR drug discovery is hampered by the lack of high resolution structural data, and considerable efforts have been invested in modeling the channel structure. Although previously published CFTR models that have been made publicly available mostly agree with experimental data relating to the overall structure, they present the channel in an outward-facing conformation that does not agree with expected properties of a "channel-like" structure. Here, we make available a model of CFTR in such a "channel-like" conformation, derived by a unique modeling approach combining restrained homology modeling and ROSETTA refinement. In contrast to others, the present model is in agreement with expected channel properties such as pore shape, dimensions, solvent accessibility, and experimentally derived distances. We have used the model to explore the interaction of open channel blockers within the pore, revealing a common binding mode and ionic interaction with K95, in agreement with experimental data. The binding-site was further validated using a virtual screening enrichment experiment, suggesting the model might be suitable for drug discovery. In addition, we subjected the model to a molecular dynamics simulation, revealing previously unaddressed salt-bridge interactions that may be important for structure stability and pore-lining residues that may take part in Cl - conductance. \textcopyright{} 2012 American Chemical Society.}

Because cooperative H-bond fluctuations and ion migration complicate the straightforward interpretation of measured DR timescales in terms of molecular dipolar rotations for these conducting media which support extensive intra- and inter-species H-bonding, one needs to separate out the individual components from the overall relaxation for examining the microscopic origin of various timescales. The present study does so and finds that reorientation of ion-complexed acetamide molecules generates relaxation timescales that are in sub-nanosecond to nanosecond range. This explains in molecular terms the nanosecond timescales reported by recent giga-Hertz DR measurements. Interestingly, the simulated survival timescale for the acetamide-Li+ complex has been found to be a few tens of nanosecond, suggesting such a cation-complexed species may be responsible for a similar timescale reported by mega-Hertz DR measurements of acetamide/potassium thiocyanate deep eutectics near room temperature. The issue of collective versus single particle relaxation is discussed, and jump waiting time distributions are determined. Dependence on anion-identity in each of the cases has been examined. In short, the present study demonstrates that assumption of nano-sized domain formation is not required for explaining the DR detected nanosecond and longer timescales in these media.}

Development of pharmaceutical strategies to treat CF requires understanding of the mechanisms underlying channel function. However, incomplete 3D structural information on the unique ABC ion channel, CFTR, hinders elucidation of its functional mechanism and correction of cystic fibrosis causing mutants. Several CFTR homology models have been developed using bacterial ABC transporters as templates but these have low sequence similarity to CFTR and are not ion channels. Here, we refine an earlier model in an outward (OWF) and develop an inward (IWF) facing model employing an integrated experimental-molecular dynamics simulation (200 ns) approach. Our IWF structure agrees well with a recently solved cryo-EM structure of a CFTR IWF state. We utilize cysteine cross-linking to verify positions and orientations of residues within trans-membrane helices (TMHs) of the OWF conformation and to reconstruct a physiologically relevant pore structure. Comparison of pore profiles of the two conformations reveal a radius sufficient to permit passage of hydrated Cl-ions in the OWF but not the IWF model. To identify structural determinants that distinguish the two conformations and possible rearrangements of TMHs within them responsible for channel gating, we perform cross-linking by bifunctional reagents of multiple predicted pairs of cysteines in TMH 6 and 12 and 6 and 9. To determine whether the effects of cross-linking on gating observed are the result of switching of the channel from open to close state, we also treat the same residue pairs with monofunctional reagents in separate experiments. Both types of reagents prevent ion currents indicating that pore blockage is primarily responsible.}

  abstract = {Background: Investigation of novel cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) potentiators, such as GLPG1837, for CF patients with gating mutations is challenging as trials require patients to withhold ivacaftor, the current standard of care. This study explored the feasibility of such a study and the impact of one-week ivacaftor withdrawal. Methods: This open-label, single-arm study aimed to enrol 32 adults {$\geq$}18 years of age with CF and at least one p.Gly551Asp (G551D) mutation. Patients received three increasing GLPG1837 dosages twice-daily for two 7-day and one 14-day period following a one-week ivacaftor washout. The primary outcome was safety; secondary outcomes were changes in sweat chloride concentration, spirometry outcomes, and pharmacokinetics. Results: Twenty-six patients enrolled; 24 completed the study. Adverse events were reported by 53.8\textendash 76.9\% of patients (dosage-dependent), with respiratory adverse events most common. Mean sweat chloride concentrations decreased from 97.7 mmol/L (baseline) to 68.7 mmol/L (end of GLPG1837 treatment). In ivacaftor-pre-treated patients, mean sweat chloride concentrations rose from 42.5 mmol/L at screening to 98.5 mmol/L after ivacaftor washout. Levels were decreased following GLPG1837 treatment (to 68.8 mmol/L at treatment end). Percent predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 s declined from 73.3\% at screening to 68.5\% after ivacaftor washout but returned to screening level at treatment end (73.1\%). Conclusions: Patient willingness to participate in the study suggests that the need for a short period of ivacaftor withdrawal may not be a barrier to development of novel potentiators, such as GLPG1837. A one-week ivacaftor washout was generally well tolerated, but resulted in a decline in lung function, which was reversed with GLPG1837 treatment to pre-washout levels. Combined with the concentration-dependent decrease in sweat chloride concentration, results show that GLPG1837 increases CFTR activity in G551D-CF patients.

On the one hand this picture is, of necessity, somewhat fuzzy at this time as the structure of the channel is unknown, even though the structures of homologous, non-channel relatives have been determined,16-19 as has that of a bacterial ClC channel.20,20a On the other hand, the pattern of anion selectivity that has emerged from studies of permeation and channel blockade offers some limited insights into the environment of the pore as experienced by visiting anions, and invites some speculations about the logic of anion channel design. The review will be selective rather than comprehensive and will focus on those studies that speak most directly to elements of pore design.},

To understand the molecular basis of this process, we have determined the 3.0\,\AA{} crystal structure of a bacterial ABC transporter (Sav1866) from Staphylococcus aureus. The homodimeric protein consists of 12 transmembrane helices in an arrangement that is consistent with cross-linking studies and electron microscopic imaging of the human multidrug resistance protein MDR1, but critically different from that reported for the bacterial lipid flippase MsbA. The observed, outward-facing conformation reflects the ATP-bound state, with the two nucleotide-binding domains in close contact and the two transmembrane domains forming a central cavity\textemdash presumably the drug translocation pathway\textemdash that is shielded from the inner leaflet of the lipid bilayer and from the cytoplasm, but exposed to the outer leaflet and the extracellular space.},

  abstract = {Recent advances in computer hardware and software have made rigorous evaluation of current biomolecular force fields using microsecond-scale simulations possible. Force fields differ in their treatment of electrostatic interactions, including the formation of salt bridges in proteins. Here we conducted an extensive evaluation of salt bridge interactions in the latest AMBER, CHARMM, and OPLS force fields, using microsecond-scale molecular dynamics simulations of amino acid analogues in explicit solvent. We focused on salt bridges between three different pairs of oppositely charged amino acids: Arg/Asp, Lys/Asp, and His(+)/Asp. Our results reveal considerable variability in the predicted KA values of the salt bridges for these force fields, as well as differences from experimental data: almost all of the force fields overestimate the strengths of the salt bridges. When amino acids are represented by side-chain analogues, the AMBER ff03 force field overestimates the KA values the least, while for complete amino acids, the AMBER ff13{$\alpha$} force field yields the lowest KA value, most likely caused by an altered balance of side-chain/side-chain and side-chain/backbone contacts. These findings confirm the notion that the implicit incorporation of solvent polarization improves the accuracy of modeling salt bridge interactions.},

  abstract = {Standard follow-up and symptomatic treatment have allowed most patients with cystic fibrosis to live to young adulthood. However, many patients still die prematurely from respiratory insufficiency. Hence, further investigations to improve these therapies are important and might have relevance for other diseases-eg, exploring how to increase airway hydration, how to safely downscale the increased inflammatory response in the lung, and how to better combat lung infections associated with cystic fibrosis. In parallel, development of modulators that target the underlying dysfunction in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is fast moving forward. Existing treatments are specific to certain mutations, or mutation class, in CFTR. An effective, although not yet entirely corrective, treatment is available for patients with class III mutations, and a treatment with modest effectiveness is available for patients who are homozygous for Phe508del, albeit at a very high cost. Corrective treatments that are non-specific to mutation class and thus applicable to all patients-eg, gene therapy, cell-based therapies, and activation of alternative ion channels that bypass CFTR-are being explored, but they are still in early stages of development. In view of the large number of patients with very rare mutations, a plan to advance personalised biomarkers to predict treatment effect is also being investigated and validated.},

This class of extensions was motivated by physical applications in icosahedral systems in biology (viruses), physics (quasicrystals) and chemistry (fullerenes). By connecting these here to extensions of E\_8, D\_6 and A\_4, we place them into the broader context of crystallographic lattices such as E\_8, suggesting their potential for applications in high energy physics, integrable systems and modular form theory. By inverting the projection, we make the case for admitting different number fields in the Cartan matrix, which could open up enticing possibilities in hyperbolic geometry and rational conformal field theory.},

  abstract = {In this paper we discuss reflection groups and root systems, in particular non-crystallographic ones, and a Clifford algebra framework for both these concepts. A review of historical as well as more recent work on viral capsid symmetries motivates the focus on the icosahedral root system H3. We discuss a notion of affine extension for noncrystallographic groups with applications to fullerenes and viruses. The icosahedrally ordered component of the nucleic acid within the virus capsid and the interaction between the two have shed light on the viral assembly process with interesting applications to antiviral therapies, drug delivery and nanotechnology. The Clifford algebra framework is very natural, as it uses precisely the structure that is already implicit in this root system and reflection group context, i.e. a vector space with an inner product. In addition, it affords a uniquely simple reflection formula, a double cover of group transformations, and more insight into the geometry, e.g. the geometry of the Coxeter plane. This approach made possible a range of root system induction proofs, such as the constructions of E8 from H3 and the exceptional 4D root systems from 3D root systems. This makes explicit various connections between what Arnold called Trinities (sets of three exceptional cases). In fact this generalises further since the induction construction contains additional cases, namely two infinite families of cases. It therefore actually yields ADE correspondences between three sets of different mathematical concepts that are usually thought of separately as polytopes, subgroups of SU (2) and ADE Lie algebras. Here we connect them explicitly and in a unified way by thinking of them as three different sets of root systems.

In this paper, we report on the use of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and machine learning to study the binding mechanism of a transition state analogue (DADMe-immucillin-H) to the purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP) enzyme. Microsecond-long MD simulations allow us to observe several binding events, following different dynamical routes and reaching diverse binding configurations. These simulations are used to estimate kinetic and thermodynamic quantities, such as k on and binding free energy, obtaining a good agreement with available experimental data. In addition, we advance a hypothesis for the slow-onset inhibition mechanism of DADMe-immucillin-H against PNP. Combining extensive MD simulations with machine learning algorithms could therefore be a fruitful approach for capturing key aspects of drug-target recognition and binding.},

  abstract = {Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is an unusual ABC transporter. It acts as an anion-selective channel that drives osmotic fluid transport across many epithelia. In the gut, CFTR is crucial for maintaining fluid and acid-base homeostasis, and its activity is tightly controlled by multiple neuro-endocrine factors. However, microbial toxins can disrupt this intricate control mechanism and trigger protracted activation of CFTR. This results in the massive faecal water loss, metabolic acidosis and dehydration that characterize secretory diarrhoeas, a major cause of malnutrition and death of children under 5~years of age. Compounds that inhibit CFTR could improve emergency treatment of diarrhoeal disease. Drawing on recent structural and functional insight, we discuss how existing CFTR inhibitors function at the molecular and cellular level. We compare their mechanisms of action to those of inhibitors of related ABC transporters, revealing some unexpected features of drug action on CFTR. Although challenges remain, especially relating to the practical effectiveness of currently available CFTR inhibitors, we discuss how recent technological advances might help develop therapies to better address this important global health need.},

Forskolin induces rapid swelling of organoids derived from healthy controls or wild-type mice, but this effect is strongly reduced in organoids of subjects with cystic fibrosis or in mice carrying the Cftr F508del mutation and is absent in Cftr-deficient organoids. This pattern is phenocopied by CFTR-specific inhibitors.

We observed that CFTR residual function and responses to drug therapy depended on both the CFTR mutation and the genetic background of the subjects. In vitro drug responses in rectal organoids positively correlated with published outcome data from clinical trials with VX-809 and VX-770, allowing us to predict from preclinical data the potential for CF patients carrying rare CFTR mutations to respond to drug therapy. We demonstrated proof of principle by selecting two subjects expressing an uncharacterized rare CFTR genotype (G1249R/F508del) who showed clinical responses to treatment with ivacaftor and one subject (F508del/R347P) who showed a limited response to drug therapy both in vitro and in vivo.

Still, the current potentiator treatment does not normalize CFTR-dependent biomarkers, indicating the need for development of more effective potentiator strategies. We have recently pioneered a functional CFTR assay in primary rectal organoids and used this model to characterize interactions between VX-770, genistein and curcumin, the latter 2 being natural food components with established CFTR potentiation capacities. Results indicated that all possible combinations of VX-770, genistein and curcumin synergistically repaired CFTR-dependent forskolin-induced swelling of organoids with CFTR-S1251N or CFTR-G551D, even under suboptimal CFTR activation and compounds concentrations, conditions that may predominate in vivo. Genistein and curcumin also enhanced forskolin-induced swelling of F508del homozygous organoids that were treated with VX-770 and the prototypical CFTR corrector VX-809. These results indicate that VX-770, genistein and curcumin in double or triple combinations can synergize in restoring CFTR-dependent fluid secretion in primary CF cells and support the use of multiple potentiators for treatment of CF.},

We studied correction of the folding mutants CFTR-p.Phe508del, -p.Ala455Glu (A455E) and -p.Asn1303Lys (N1303K) by VX-809 and 18 other correctors (C1\textendash C18) using a functional CFTR assay in human intestinal CF organoids. Function of both CFTR-p.Phe508del and -p.Ala455Glu was enhanced by a variety of correctors but no residual or corrector-induced activity was associated with CFTR-p.Asn1303Lys. Importantly, VX-809-induced correction was most dominant for CFTR-p.Phe508del, while correction of CFTR-p.Ala455Glu was highest by a subgroup of compounds called bithiazoles (C4, C13, C14 and C17) and C5. These data support the development of mutation-specific correctors for optimal treatment of different CFTR trafficking mutants, and identify C5 and bithiazoles as the most promising compounds for correction of CFTR-p.Ala455Glu.

  abstract = {During assembly of many viruses a powerful ATP-driven motor translocates DNA into a preformed procapsid. A Walker-A ``P-loop'' motif is proposed to coordinate ATP binding and hydrolysis with DNA translocation. We use genetic, biochemical, and biophysical techniques to survey the roles of P-loop residues in bacteriophage lambda motor function. We identify 55 point mutations that reduce virus yield to below detectible levels in a highly sensitive genetic complementation assay and 33 that cause varying reductions in yield. Most changes in the predicted conserved residues K76, R79, G81, and S83 produce no detectible yield. Biochemical analyses show that R79A and S83A mutant proteins fold, assemble, and display genome maturation activity similar to wild-type, but exhibit little ATPase or DNA packaging activity. Kinetic DNA cleavage and ATPase measurements implicate R79 in motor ring assembly on DNA, supporting recent structural models that locate the P-loop at the interface between motor subunits. Single-molecule measurements detect no translocation for K76A\&R, while G81A and S83A exhibit strong impairments consistent with their predicted roles in ATP binding. We identify eight residue changes spanning A78-K84 that yield impaired translocation phenotypes and show that Walker-A residues play important roles in determining motor velocity, pausing, and processivity. The efficiency of initiation of packaging correlates strongly with motor velocity. Frequent pausing and slipping caused by changes A78V and R79K suggest these residues are important for ATP alignment and coupling of ATP binding to DNA gripping. Our findings support recent structural models implicating the P-loop arginine in ATP hydrolysis and mechanochemical coupling.,},

Despite the attention given to DES and their claimed benignity when compared with ionic liquids, their environmental impact is poorly characterized and understood. In this work, the toxicity of some DES prepared with cholinium chloride ([Chol]Cl) as HBA and organic acids, namely acetic, citric, lactic, and glycolic acids, as HBD was measured with the Microtox toxicity test. These DES showed an intermediate toxicity when compared with the respective starting materials and can be considered as "moderately toxic," their toxicity being clearly dominated by the concentration of the acid. They are also shown to be more toxic than their corresponding ionic liquids, namely cholinium glycolate, cholinium acetate, cholinium dihydrogencitrate, and cholinium lactate. Further studies are necessary on the ecotoxicology and biodegradability of DES, namely to evaluate their "green" character and their alternative capability to both classic solvents and ionic liquids.},

In the last decade, a lot of progress has been made in the development of primary cell cultures into 3D patient-derived disease models. The advantage of these models is that the endogenous CFTR function is affected by the patient's mutation as well as other genetic or environmental factors.

CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR)-mediated ion transport can be studied ex vivo in rectal biopsies by intestinal current measurement (ICM). Objectives: To describe reference values and validate ICM for the diagnostic classification of questionable CF at all patient ages. Methods: ICM was performed in 309 rectal biopsies from 130 infants, children and adults including patients with known pancreatic-insufficient (PI)-CF (n=34), pancreatic-sufficient (PS)-CF (n=7), patients with an unclear diagnosis with mild CF symptoms, intermediate sweat test and/or CFTR mutation screening (n=61) and healthy controls (n=28). ICM was correlated to sweat chloride, extensive CFTR genotype and transcript analysis in the diagnostic group. The results were compared with previous ICM data in subjects with CF, congenital bilateral absence of the vas deferens, heterozygotes and controls. Results: The cumulative chloride secretory response of {$\Delta$}Isc,carbachol, {$\Delta$}I sc,cAMP/forskolin and {$\Delta$}Isc,histamine was the best diagnostic ICM parameter (cut-off 34 {$\mu$}A/cm2 between patients with known PS-CF and controls), differentiating patients with questionable CF into PS-CF (n=6) and 'CF unlikely' (n=55) groups. Extensive genotype analysis detected two mutations (40\% disease-causing) in 100\% of individuals classified as PS-CF compared with 1.8\% in those classified as 'CF unlikely'. Conclusions: This comprehensive investigation of CFTR function and genotype underlines the diagnostic value of ICM, especially for confirmation of CF in the absence of two disease-causing CFTR mutations, exclusion of CF despite intermediate sweat test and age groups unsuitable for nasal potential difference measurements. ICM is an important tool for functional assessment in CFTR mutations of unknown clinical relevance.},

In fact, the fibrillogenesis of Ataxin 3, responsible for the spinocerebbellar ataxia 3, is strictly related to the JD thermodynamic stability. Whereas recent NMR studies have demonstrated that different JD conformations exist, the likelihood of JD achievable conformational states in solution is still an open issue. Marked differences in the available NMR models are located in the hairpin region, supporting the idea that JD has a flexible hairpin in dynamic equilibrium between open and closed states. In this work we have carried out an investigation on the JD conformational arrangement by means of both classical molecular dynamics (MD) and Metadynamics employing essential coordinates as collective variables. We provide a representation of the free energy landscape characterizing the transition pathway from a JD open-like structure to a closed-like conformation. Findings of our in silico study strongly point to the closed-like conformation as the most likely for a Josephin Domain in water.},

The goals of the present study are to quantitatively assess the gating defects associated with the N1303K mutation and its pharmacological response to CFTR modulators including potentiators VX-770 and GLPG1837 and correctors VX-809, and VX-661. Methods: Gating behavior and pharmacological responses to CFTR potentiators were assessed using patch-clamp technique in the excised, inside-out mode. We also examined the effects of GLPG1837, VX-770, VX-809 and VX-661 on N1303K-CFTR surface expression using Western blot analysis. Results: Like wild-type (WT) CFTR, N1303K-CFTR channels were activated by protein kinase A-dependent phosphorylation, but the open probability (Po) of phosphorylated N1303K-CFTR was extremely low (\textasciitilde 0.03 vs \textasciitilde 0.45 in WT channels). N1303K mutants showed abnormal responses to ATP analogs or mutations that disrupt ATP hydrolysis and/or dimerization of CFTR's two nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs). However, the Po of N1303K-CFTR was dramatically increased by GLPG1837 (\textasciitilde 17-fold) and VX-770 (\textasciitilde 8-fold). VX-809 or VX-661 enhanced N1303K-CFTR maturation by 2\textendash 3 fold, and co-treatment with GLPG1837 or VX-770 did not show any negative drug-drug interaction. Conclusion: N1303K has a severe gating defect, reduced ATP-dependence and aberrant response to ATP analogs. These results suggest a defective function of the NBDs in N1303K-CFTR. An improvement of channel function by GLPG1837 or VX-770 and an increase of Band C protein by VX-809 or VX-661 support a therapeutic strategy of combining CFTR potentiator and corrector for patients carrying the N1303K mutation.},

Yet, despite the success of this endeavor, many other compounds have been proposed as therapeutic agents in the treatment of CF. Of note, several of these compounds are naturally occurring, and are present in spices from the grocery store and over the counter preparations in health food stores.

By combining high-throughput MD with Markov state models (MSMs), it is now possible to obtain long time-scale behavior of small to intermediate biomolecules and complexes. To model the interactions of many molecules at large length scales, particle-based reaction-diffusion (RD) simulations are more suit{$\rightleftharpoons$}able but lack molecular detail. Thus, coupling MSMs and RD simulations (MSM/RD) would be highly desirable, as they could efficiently produce simulations at large time and length scales, while still conserving the characteristic features of the interactions observed at atomic detail. While such a coupling seems straightforward, fundamental questions are still open: Which definition of MSM states is suitable? Which protocol to merge and split RD particles in an association/dissociation reaction will conserve the correct bimolecular kinetics and thermodynamics? In this paper, we make the first step toward MSM/RD by laying out a general theory of coupling and proposing a first implementation for association/dissociation of a protein with a small ligand (A + B {$\rightleftharpoons$} C). Applications on a toy model and CO diffusion into the heme cavity of myoglobin are reported.},

  abstract = {Potential of mean force (PMF) calculations are used to characterize the free energy landscape of protein\textendash lipid and protein\textendash protein association within membranes. Coarse-grained simulations allow binding free energies to be determined with reasonable statistical error. This accuracy relies on defining a good collective variable to describe the binding and unbinding transitions, and upon criteria for assessing the convergence of the simulation toward representative equilibrium sampling. As examples, we calculate protein\textendash lipid binding PMFs for ANT/cardiolipin and Kir2.2/PIP2, using umbrella sampling on a distance coordinate. These highlight the importance of replica exchange between windows for convergence. The use of two independent sets of simulations, initiated from bound and unbound states, provide strong evidence for simulation convergence. For a model protein\textendash protein interaction within a membrane, center-of-mass distance is shown to be a poor collective variable for describing transmembrane helix\textendash helix dimerization. Instead, we employ an alternative intermolecular distance matrix RMS (DRMS) coordinate to obtain converged PMFs for the association of the glycophorin transmembrane domain. While the coarse-grained force field gives a reasonable Kd for dimerization, the majority of the bound population is revealed to be in a near-native conformation. Thus, the combination of a refined reaction coordinate with improved sampling reveals previously unnoticed complexities of the dimerization free energy landscape. We propose the use of replica-exchange umbrella sampling starting from different initial conditions as a robust approach for calculation of the binding energies in membrane simulations.},

Fuelled by their premature labelling as 'green solvents', academic research has flourished. However, in recent years environmental aspects related to ILs have been strongly addressed, stating that many ILs commonly used cannot be regarded as 'green derivatives'. Likewise, ILs costs are still a barrier for practical uses. Attempting to combine sustainability with the promising added-values of ILs, the third generation of ILs is currently under development. Likewise, deep-eutectic-solvents (DESs) appear in the horizon as an attractive and cost-effective option for using ionic solvents in biotransformations. DESs are often produced by gently warming and stirring two (bio-based and cheap) salts (e.g. choline chloride and urea). First successful uses of DES in biotransformations were reported recently. It may be expected that knowledge accumulated in (second generation) ILs and biotransformations could be turned into real applications by using these DESs, and third generation ILs, in the coming years. \textcopyright{} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.}

Objectives: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of tezacaftor monotherapy and of tezacaftor/ivacaftor combination therapy in subjects with cystic fibrosis homozygous for F508del or compound heterozygous for F508del and G551D. Methods: This was a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multicenter, phase 2 study (NCT01531673). Subjects homozygous for F508del received tezacaftor (10 to 150 mg) every day alone or in combination with ivacaftor (150 mg every 12 h) in a dose escalation phase, as well as in a dosage regimen testing phase. Subjects compound heterozygous for F508del and G551D, taking physician-prescribed ivacaftor, received tezacaftor (100 mg every day). Measurements and Main Results: Primary endpoints were safety through Day 56 and change in sweat chloride from baseline through Day 28. Secondary endpoints included change in percent predicted FEV1 (ppFEV1) from baseline through Day 28 and pharmacokinetics. The incidence of adverse events was similar across treatment arms. Tezacaftor (100 mg every day)/ivacaftor (150 mg every 12 h) resulted in a 6.04 mmol/L decrease in sweat chloride and 3.75 percentage point increase in ppFEV1 in subjects homozygous for F508del, and a 7.02 mmol/L decrease in sweat chloride and 4.60 percentage point increase in ppFEV1 in subjects compound heterozygous for F508del and G551D from baseline through Day 28 (P\,{$<$}\,0.05 for all). Conclusions: These results support continued clinical development of tezacaftor (100 mg every day) in combination with ivacaftor (150 mg every 12 h) in subjects with cystic fibrosis.

Here we discover that bacterial effectors including VirA from nonvacuole Shigella flexneri and EspG from extracellular Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) harbor TBC-like dual-finger motifs and exhibits potent RabGAP activities. Specific inactivation of Rab1 by VirA/EspG disrupts ER-to-Golgi trafficking. S. flexneri intracellular persistence requires VirA TBC-like GAP activity that mediates bacterial escape from autophagy-mediated host defense. Rab1 inactivation by EspG severely blocks host secretory pathway, resulting in inhibited interleukin-8 secretion from infected cells. Crystal structures of VirA/EspG-Rab1-GDP-aluminum fluoride complexes highlight TBC-like catalytic role for the arginine and glutamine finger residues and reveal a 3D architecture distinct from that of the TBC domain. Structure of Arf6-EspG-Rab1 ternary complex illustrates a pathogenic signaling complex that rewires host Arf signaling to Rab1 inactivation. Structural distinctions of VirA/EspG further predict a possible extensive presence of TBC-like RabGAP effectors in counteracting various host defenses. \textcopyright{} 2012 Elsevier Inc.}

The crystal structure of the nucleotide-binding domain of an SMC protein in complex with the adenylate kinase bisubstrate inhibitor P(1),P(5)-di(adenosine-5') pentaphosphate (Ap5A) suggests that AMP binds to the conserved Q-loop glutamine during the adenylate kinase reaction. Therefore, we hypothesized that mutating the corresponding residue in CFTR, Gln-1291, selectively disrupts adenylate kinase-dependent channel gating at physiologic nucleotide concentrations. We found that substituting Gln-1291 with bulky side-chain amino acids abolished the effects of Ap5A, AMP, and adenosine 5'-monophosphoramidate on CFTR channel function. 8-Azidoadenosine 5'-monophosphate photolabeling of the AMP-binding site and adenylate kinase activity were disrupted in Q1291F CFTR. The Gln-1291 mutations did not alter the potency of ATP at stimulating current or ATP-dependent gating when ATP was the only nucleotide present. However, when physiologic concentrations of ADP and AMP were added, adenylate kinase-deficient Q1291F channels opened significantly less than wild type. Consistent with this result, we found that Q1291F CFTR displayed significantly reduced Cl(-) channel function in well differentiated primary human airway epithelia. These results indicate that a highly conserved residue of an ABC transporter plays an important role in adenylate kinase-dependent CFTR gating. Furthermore, the results suggest that adenylate kinase activity is important for normal CFTR channel function in airway epithelia.},

In this brief overview, the fundamental nature of the cation-pi interaction will be described, relying on fundamental, gas phase studies of the effect. Then, several examples of cation-pi interactions involving aromatic amino acids will be described. These include contributions to protein secondary structure, in which Phe/Tyr/Trp...lysine (Lys)/arginine interactions are common. We will also describe several examples of protein-ligand interactions that make use of cation-pi interactions.

We analyzed and compared the simulation results obtained by these two methods based on several aspects, such as root mean square deviation (RMSD), native contacts, cluster analysis, folding snapshots, free energy landscape, and the evolution of the radius of gyration, which showed that these eight proteins were successfully and consistently folded into the corresponding native structures by AMD simulations carried out at room temperature. In addition, the folding occurred in the range of 40{$\sim$}180 ns after starting from the linear structures of the eight proteins at 300 K. By contrast, these stable folding structures were not found when the traditional molecular dynamics (MD) simulation was used. At the same time, the influence of high temperatures (350, 400, and 450 K) is also further investigated. Study found that the simulation efficiency of AMD is higher than that of MD simulations, regardless of the temperature. Of these temperatures, 300 K is the most suitable temperature for protein folding for all systems. To further investigate the efficiency of AMD, another trajectory was simulated for eight proteins with the same linear structure but different random seeds at 300 K. Both AMD trajectories reached the correct folded structures. Our result clearly shows that AMD simulation are a highly efficient and reliable method for the study of protein folding.},

We performed \textmu s atomistic molecular dynamics simulations of inactive and active full-length Rab5 anchored to a complex model bilayer with composition of the early endosome membrane. Direct interactions between the Rab5 G domain and the bilayer were observed. We found two dominant nucleotide-dependent orientations characterised by a different accessibility of the switch regions. The ``buried switch'' orientation was mainly associated with inactive Rab5 accompanied with a rather extended structure of the hypervariable C-terminal region. Active Rab5 preferred an orientation in which the switch regions are accessible to effector proteins. These structural differences may provide an opportunity to selectively target one Rab5 state and lead to new approaches in the development of Rab5-specific therapies.},

  abstract = {Potassium (K+) channels are specialized membrane proteins that are able to facilitate and regulate the conduction of K+ through cell membranes. Comprising five specific cation binding sites (S0-S4) formed by the backbone carbonyl groups of conserved residues common to all K+ channels, the narrow selectivity filter allows fast conduction of K+ while being highly selective for K+ over Na+. To extend our knowledge of the microscopic mechanism underlying selectivity in K+ channels, we characterize the free energy landscapes governing the entry and translocation of a Na+ or a K+ from the extracellular side into the selectivity filter of KcsA. The entry process of an extracellular ion is examined in the presence of two additional K+ in the pore, and the three-ion potential of mean force is computed using extensive all-atom umbrella sampling molecular dynamics simulations. A comparison of the potentials of mean force yields a number of important results. First, the free energy minima corresponding to configurations with extracellular K+ or Na+ in binding site S0 or S1 are similar in depth, suggesting that the thermodynamic selectivity governed by the free energy minima for those two binding sites is insignificant. Second, the free energy barriers between stable multi-ion configurations are generally higher for Na+ than for K+, implying that the kinetics of ion conduction is slower when a Na+ enters the pore. Third, the region corresponding to binding site S2 near the center of the narrow pore emerges as the most selective for K+ over Na+. In particular, while there is a stable minimum for K+ in site S2, Na+ faces a steep free energy increase with no local free energy well in this region. Lastly, analysis shows that selectivity is not correlated with the overall coordination number of the ion entering the pore, but is predominantly affected by changes in the type of coordinating ligands (carbonyls versus water molecules). These results further highlight the importance of the central region near binding site S2 in the selectivity filter of K+ channels. \textcopyright{} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract = {Cystic fibrosis is a common life-limiting autosomal recessive genetic disorder, with highest prevalence in Europe, North America, and Australia. The disease is caused by mutation of a gene that encodes a chloride-conducting transmembrane channel called the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), which regulates anion transport and mucociliary clearance in the airways. Functional failure of CFTR results in mucus retention and chronic infection and subsequently in local airway inflammation that is harmful to the lungs. CFTR dysfunction mainly affects epithelial cells, although there is evidence of a role in immune cells. Cystic fibrosis affects several body systems, and morbidity and mortality is mostly caused by bronchiectasis, small airways obstruction, and progressive respiratory impairment. Important comorbidities caused by epithelial cell dysfunction occur in the pancreas (malabsorption), liver (biliary cirrhosis), sweat glands (heat shock), and vas deferens (infertility). The development and delivery of drugs that improve the clearance of mucus from the lungs and treat the consequent infection, in combination with correction of pancreatic insufficiency and undernutrition by multidisciplinary teams, have resulted in remarkable improvements in quality of life and clinical outcomes in patients with cystic fibrosis, with median life expectancy now older than 40 years. Innovative and transformational therapies that target the basic defect in cystic fibrosis have recently been developed and are effective in improving lung function and reducing pulmonary exacerbations. Further small molecule and gene-based therapies are being developed to restore CFTR function; these therapies promise to be disease modifying and to improve the lives of people with cystic fibrosis.},

Since then more than thirty therapeutic antibodies have been marketed, mostly as oncology, autoimmune and inflammatory therapeutics. While antibodies are very efficient, their cost-effectiveness has always been discussed owing to their high costs, accumulating to more than one billion dollars from preclinical development through to market approval. Because of this, therapeutic antibodies are inaccessible to some patients in both developed and developing countries. The growing interest in biosimilar antibodies as affordable versions of therapeutic antibodies may provide alternative treatment options as well potentially decreasing costs. As certain markets begin to capitalize on this opportunity, regulatory authorities continue to refine the requirements for demonstrating quality, efficacy and safety of biosimilar compared to originator products. In addition to biosimilars, innovations in antibody engineering are providing the opportunity to design biobetter antibodies with improved properties to maximize efficacy. Enhancing effector function, antibody drug conjugates (ADC) or targeting multiple disease pathways via multi-specific antibodies are being explored. The manufacturing process of antibodies is also moving forward with advancements relating to host cell production and purification processes. Studies into the physical and chemical degradation pathways of antibodies are contributing to the design of more stable proteins guided by computational tools. Moreover, the delivery and pharmacokinetics of antibody-based therapeutics are improving as optimized formulations are pursued through the implementation of recent innovations in the field.},

  abstract = {Opening of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator Cl(-) channel is dependent both on phosphorylation and on ATP binding and hydrolysis. However, the mechanisms by which these cytoplasmic regulatory factors open the Cl(-) channel pore are not known. We have used patch clamp recording to investigate the accessibility of cytoplasmically applied cysteine-reactive reagents to cysteines introduced along the length of the pore-lining sixth transmembrane region (TM6) of a cysteine-less variant of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator. We find that methanethiosulfonate (MTS) reagents modify irreversibly cysteines substituted for TM6 residues Phe-337, Thr-338, Ser-341, Ile-344, Val-345, Met-348, Ala-349, Arg-352, and Gln-353 when applied to the cytoplasmic side of open channels. However, the apparent rate of modification by internal [2-sulfonatoethyl] methanethiosulfonate (MTSES), a negatively charged MTS reagent, is dependent on the activation state of the channels. In particular, cysteines introduced far along the axis of TM6 from the inside (T338C, S341C, I344C) showed no evidence of significant modification even after prolonged pretreatment of non-activated channels with internal MTSES. In contrast, cysteines introduced closer to the inside of TM6 (V345C, M348C) were readily modified in both activated and non-activated channels. Access of a permeant anion, Au(CN)(2)(-), to T338C was similarly dependent upon channel activation state. The pattern of MTS modification we observe allows us to designate different pore-lining amino acid side chains to distinct functional regions of the channel pore. One logical interpretation of these findings is that cytoplasmic access to residues at the narrowest region of the pore changes concomitant with activation.},

  abstract = {Introduction Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a severe monogenic disorder caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. Several types of CFTR modulators (correctors/potentiators) have been developed to overcome protein dysfunction associated with these mutations. CFTR modulator therapy is now available for the major CF-causing mutations, however 10\% of people with CF remain without causal treatments. By combining investigational and market approved CFTR modulators, we aimed to maximise functional rescue of iva-, luma- and tezacaftor refractory mutants G85E and N1303K. Methods We used the well-established forskolin induced swelling (FIS) in primary rectal organoids to assess responses to different CFTR corrector and potentiator types. The FIS analysis was performed with brightfield microscopy, allowing both 1 h and 24 h follow-up. Corrector and potentiator activity of elexacaftor was investigated. Results For G85E, maximal rescue was observed by a combination of elexacaftor and corr4a. For N1303K, the quadruple combination teza-elexa-ivacaftor with apigenin was required to obtain a rescue similar to that of luma-ivacaftor rescued F508del. Elexacaftor rescued G85E and N1303K by different mechanisms, with chronic corrector effects on G85E and acute potentiation of N1303K only in the presence of ivacaftor. Synergy in N1303K rescue for iva-elexacaftor and apigenin suggests at least three potentiator mechanisms for this mutant. 24 h FIS identified ivacaftor as the main CFTR modulator for N1303K and elexacaftor and apigenin as co-potentiators. Conclusions Novel combinations of CFTR modulators can further improve functional rescue of G85E and N1303K in rectal organoids, although for N1303K more effective CFTR modulators are still needed.},

Orai1, which represents the subunit forming the CRAC channel complex, is activated by the ER resident Ca2+ sensor STIM1. The genetically inherited Stormorken syndrome disease has been associated with the STIM1 single point R304W mutant. The resulting constitutive activation of Orai1 mainly involves the CRAC-activating domain CAD/SOAR of STIM1, the exposure of which is regulated by the molecular interplay between three cytosolic STIM1 coiled-coil (CC) domains. Here we present a dual mechanism by which STIM1 R304W attains the pathophysiological, constitutive activity eliciting the Stormorken syndrome. The R304W mutation induces a helical elongation within the CC1 domain, which together with an increased CC1 homomerization, destabilize the resting state of STIM1. This culminates, even in the absence of store depletion, in structural extension and CAD/SOAR exposure of STIM1 R304W leading to constitutive CRAC channel activation and Stormorken disease.},

C225R and R1066C are both associated with pancreatic insufficiency, but the former mutation is associated with mild and unusual lung disease, whereas the latter is associated with severe lung disease. In the present study, we expressed these mutants heterologously in HeLa cells, and we analyzed protein synthesis by immunoprecipitation and chloride channel function by using a halide-sensitive fluorescent dye, 6-methoxy-N-ethylquinolinium. Immunoprecipitation and functional studies showed that cells transfected with C225R-CFTR exhibit cAMP-dependent chloride fluxes; C225R-CFTR protein is poorly expressed but fully glycosylated and can be compared with R117H-CFTR. R1066C-CFTR protein is not correctly processed and, unlike {$\Delta$}F508-CFTR, this defect cannot be corrected by reduced temperature or overexpression in butyrate-treated cells; defective processing may occur at a different step in the biosynthetic pathway. These results point to two different mechanisms underlying the same pancreatic status and suggest that it is unwise to use pancreatic sufficiency and insufficiency to define mild and severe cystic fibrosis (CF) disease, respectively. Finally, the experimental model described here may be helpful to predict the pulmonary status of CF patients bearing mutations located in putative membrane-spanning domains of the CFTR protein.},

The most common mutation, F508del, leads to CFTR impaired plasma membrane trafficking. Therapies modulating CFTR basic defect are emerging, such as VX-809, a corrector of F508del-CFTR traffic which just succeeded in a Phase III clinical trial. We recently showed that VX-809 is additive to two other correctors (VRT-325 and compound 4a). Here, we aimed to determine whether the differential rescuing by these compounds results from cell-specific factors or rather from distinct effects at the early biogenesis and/or processing. The rescuing efficiencies of the above three correctors were first compared in different cellular models (primary respiratory cells, cystic fibrosis bronchial epithelial and baby hamster kidney [BHK] cell lines) by functional approaches: micro-Ussing chamber and iodide efflux. Next, biochemical methods (metabolic labeling, pulse-chase and immunoprecipitation) were used to determine their impact on CFTR biogenesis / processing. Functional analyses revealed that VX-809 has the greatest rescuing efficacy and that the relative efficiencies of the three compounds are essentially maintained in all three cellular models tested. Nevertheless, biochemical data show that VX-809 significantly stabilizes F508del-CFTR immature form, an effect that is not observed for C3 nor C4. VX-809 and C3 also significantly increase accumulation of immature CFTR. Our data suggest that VX-809 increases the stability of F508del-CFTR immature form at an early phase of its biogenesis, thus explaining its increased efficacy when inducing its rescue.},

The majority of CF mutations affect protein folding and stability leading overall to diminished apical anion conductance of epithelial cells. The recently published cryo-EM structures of full-length human and zebrafish CFTR provide a good model to gain insight into structure\textendash function relationships of CFTR variants. Although, some of the structures were determined in the phosphorylated and ATP-bound active state, none of the static structures showed an open pathway for chloride permeation. Therefore, we performed molecular dynamics simulations to generate a conformational ensemble of the protein and used channel detecting algorithms to identify conformations with an opened channel. Our simulations indicate a main intracellular entry at TM4/6, a secondary pore at TM10/12, and a bottleneck region involving numerous amino acids from TM1, TM6, and TM12 in accordance with experiments. Since chloride ions entered the pathway in our equilibrium simulations, but did not traverse the bottleneck region, we performed metadynamics simulations, which revealed two possible exits. One of the chloride ions exits includes hydrophobic lipid tails that may explain the lipid-dependency of CFTR function. In summary, our in silico study provides a detailed description of a potential chloride channel pathway based on a recent cryo-EM structure and may help to understand the gating of the CFTR chloride channel, thus contributing to novel strategies to rescue dysfunctional mutants.},

  abstract = {While Langevin integrators are popular in the study of equilibrium properties of complex systems, it is challenging to estimate the timestep-induced discretization error: the degree to which the sampled phase-space or configuration-space probability density departs from the desired target density due to the use of a finite integration timestep. In [[1][1]], Sivak et al . introduced a convenient approach to approximating a natural measure of error between the sampled density and the target equilibrium density, the KL divergence, in phase space , but did not specifically address the issue of configuration-space properties , which are much more commonly of interest in molecular simulations. Here, we introduce a variant of this near-equilibrium estimator capable of measuring the error in the configuration-space marginal density, validating it against a complex but exact nested Monte Carlo estimator to show that it reproduces the KL divergence with high fidelity. To illustrate its utility, we employ this new near-equilibrium estimator to assess a claim that a recently proposed Langevin integrator introduces extremely small configuration-space density errors up to the stability limit at no extra computational expense. Finally, we show how this approach to quantifying sampling bias can be applied to a wide variety of stochastic integrators by following a straightforward procedure to compute the appropriate shadow work, and describe how it can be extended to quantify the error in arbitrary marginal or conditional distributions of interest.

  abstract = {The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) anion channel, crucial to epithelial salt and water homeostasis, and defective due to mutations in its gene in patients with cystic fibrosis, is a unique member of the large family of ATP-binding cassette transport proteins. Regulation of CFTR channel activity is stringently controlled by phosphorylation and nucleotide binding. Structural changes that underlie transitions between active and inactive functional states are not yet fully understood. Indeed the first 3D structures of dephosphorylated, ATP-free, and phosphorylated ATP-bound states were only recently reported. Here we have determined the structure of inactive and active states of a thermally stabilized CFTR, the latter with a very high channel open probability, confirmed after reconstitution into proteoliposomes. These structures, obtained at nominal resolution of 4.3 and 6.6 \AA, reveal a unique repositioning of the transmembrane helices and regulatory domain density that provide insights into the structural transition between active and inactive functional states of CFTR. Moreover, we observe an extracellular vestibule that may provide anion access to the pore due to the conformation of transmembrane helices 7 and 8 that differs from the previous orthologue CFTR structures. In conclusion, our work contributes detailed structural information on an active, open state of the CFTR anion channel.},

  abstract = {A systematic analysis is performed on the effectiveness of removing degrees of freedom from hydrogen atoms and/or increasing hydrogen masses to increase the efficiency of molecular dynamics simulations of hydrogen-rich systems such as proteins in water. In proteins, high-frequency bond-angle vibrations involving hydrogen atoms limit the time step to 3 fs, which is already a factor of 1.5 beyond the commonly used time step of 2 fs. Removing these degrees of freedom from the system by constructing hydrogen atoms as dummy atoms, allows the time step to be increased to 7 fs, a factor of 3.5 compared with 2 fs. Additionally, a gain in simulation stability can be achieved by increasing the masses of hydrogen atoms with remaining degrees of freedom from 1 to 4 u. Increasing hydrogen mass without removing the high-frequency degrees of freedom allows the time step to be increased only to 4 fs, a factor of two, compared with 2 fs. The net gain in efficiency of sampling configurational space may be up to 15\% lower than expected from the increase in time step due to the increase in viscosity and decrease in diffusion constant. In principle, introducing dummy atoms and increasing hydrogen mass do not influence thermodynamical properties of the system and dynamical properties are shown to be influenced only to a moderate degree. Comparing the maximum time step attainable with these methods (7 fs) to the time step of 2 fs that is routinely used in simulation, and taking into account the increase in viscosity and decrease in diffusion constant, we can say that a net gain in simulation efficiency of a factor of 3 to 3.5 can be achieved. \textcopyright{} 1999 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.},

  abstract = {Simple Summary Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a multi-organ disease that affects the epithelia and exocrine glands, particularly the lungs, but also the pancreas, liver, kidneys, and intestines. Respiratory disease is the most common cause of death. Many of the problems in respiratory disease can be attributed to the viscous nature of the mucus. Indeed, thick mucus in the airways leads to reduced mucociliary clearance, chronic bacterial infections and inflammation followed by destruction of the lung parenchyma. The composition of the periciliary fluid (ASL) is regulated by the transport of water and ions through different ion channels and transporters distributed in a non-symmetrical way to the two parts of the epithelium. Mucus is the first line of defense against inhaled particles and protects the epithelium by trapping and eliminating harmful substances through the blink of the cells that push them towards the nose. In patients with CF the malfunction of the mutated CFTR causes a reduction in bicarbonate secretion with consequent reduction in the expansion of mucins and the formation of thick mucus. In this work we have shown that, in vitro, the administration of a solution containing bicarbonate ion would act not only on the osmotic component of the mucus, but directly on the expansion of the mucins by acting on its viscoelastic properties. Abstract Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disease associated with the defective function of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein that causes obstructive disease and chronic bacterial infections in airway epithelia. Deletion of phenylalanine at position 508, p.F508del, the most frequent mutation among CF patients, causes a folding and traffic defect, resulting in a dramatic reduction in the CFTR expression. To investigate whether the direct application of bicarbonate could modify the properties of the airway surface liquid (ASL), we measured the micro-viscosity, fluid transport and pH of human bronchial epithelial cells monolayers. We have demonstrated that the treatment of a CF-epithelia with an iso-osmotic solution containing bicarbonate is capable of reducing both, the ASL viscosity and the apical fluid re-absorption. We suggest the possibility of design a supportive treatment based on topical application of bicarbonate, or any other alkaline buffer.},

Recent developments in X-ray crystallography and cryo-EM microscopy have revealed what these proteins look like in atomic detail but do not tell us how they function. Molecular dynamics simulations have progressed to the point that we can now simulate realistic molecular assemblies to produce quantitative calculations of the thermodynamic and kinetic quantities that control function. In this review, we summarize the state of atomistic simulation methods for ion channels to understand their conduction, activation, and drug modulation mechanisms. We are at a crossroads in atomistic simulation, where long time scale observation can provide unbiased exploration of mechanisms, supplemented by biased free energy methodologies. We illustrate the use of these approaches to describe ion conduction and selectivity in voltage-gated sodium and acid-sensing ion channels. Studies of channel gating present a significant challenge, as activation occurs on longer time scales. Enhanced sampling approaches can ensure convergence on minimum free energy pathways for activation, as illustrated here for pentameric ligand-gated ion channels that are principal to nervous system function and the actions of general anesthetics. We also examine recent studies of local anesthetic and antiepileptic drug binding to a sodium channel, revealing sites and pathways that may offer new targets for drug development. Modern simulations thus offer a range of molecular-level insights into ion channel function and modulation as a learning platform for mechanistic discovery and drug development.},

The distribution of ions near the protein surface and the stability of various structural motifs are observed to exhibit interesting dependence on the local sequence and structure. Whereas chloride association to the protein is overall enhanced as the temperature increases, the sodium distribution in the C-terminal helical region and, to a smaller degree, the chloride distribution in the same region are found higher at the lower temperature. The similar trend is also observed in nonlinear Poisson-Boltzmann calculations with a temperature-dependent water dielectric constant, once conformational averaging over a series of MD snapshots is done. The unexpected temperature dependence in the ion distribution is explained on the basis of the cancellation of association entropy for ion-side chain pairs of opposite-charge and like-charge characters, which have positive and negative contributions, respectively. The C-terminal helix is observed to partially melt whereas a short {$\beta$} strand forms at the higher temperature with little salt dependence. The N-termal region, by contrast, develops partial helical structure at a higher salt concentration. These observed behaviors are consistent with solvent and salt screening playing an important role in stabilizing the canonical chemokine fold of hLtn. \textcopyright{} 2006 American Chemical Society.},

  abstract = {Potassium ion channels form pores in cell membranes, allowing potassium ions through while preventing the passage of sodium ions. Despite numerous high-resolution structures, it is not yet possible to relate their structure to their single molecule function other than at a qualitative level. Over the past decade, there has been a concerted effort using molecular dynamics to capture the thermodynamics and kinetics of conduction by calculating potentials of mean force (PMF). These can be used, in conjunction with the electro-diffusion theory, to predict the conductance of a specific ion channel. Here, we calculate seven independent PMFs, thereby studying the differences between two potassium ion channels, the effect of the CHARMM CMAP forcefield correction, and the sensitivity and reproducibility of the method. Thermodynamically stable ion-water configurations of the selectivity filter can be identified from all the free energy landscapes, but the heights of the kinetic barriers for potassium ions to move through the selectivity filter are, in nearly all cases, too high to predict conductances in line with experiment. This implies it is not currently feasible to predict the conductance of potassium ion channels, but other simpler channels may be more tractable. \textcopyright{} 2013 American Chemical Society.}

  abstract = {This paper uses the binding pocket of human carbonic anhydrase II (HCAII, EC 4.2.1.1) as a tool to examine the properties of Hofmeister anions that determine (i) where, and how strongly, they associate with concavities on the surfaces of proteins and (ii) how, upon binding, they alter the structure of water within those concavities. Results from X-ray crystallography and isothermal titration calorimetry show that most anions associate with the binding pocket of HCAII by forming inner-sphere ion pairs with the Zn2+ cofactor. In these ion pairs, the free energy of anion-Zn2+ association is inversely proportional to the free energetic cost of anion dehydration; this relationship is consistent with the mechanism of ion pair formation suggested by the "law of matching water affinities". Iodide and bromide anions also associate with a hydrophobic declivity in the wall of the binding pocket. Molecular dynamics simulations suggest that anions, upon associating with Zn2+, trigger rearrangements of water that extend up to 8 \AA{} away from their surfaces. These findings expand the range of interactions previously thought to occur between ions and proteins by suggesting that (i) weakly hydrated anions can bind complementarily shaped hydrophobic declivities, and that (ii) ion-induced rearrangements of water within protein concavities can (in contrast with similar rearrangements in bulk water) extend well beyond the first hydration shells of the ions that trigger them. This study paints a picture of Hofmeister anions as a set of structurally varied ligands that differ in size, shape, and affinity for water and, thus, in their ability to bind to - and to alter the charge and hydration structure of - polar, nonpolar, and topographically complex concavities on the surfaces of proteins.}

None of the type IIIc, AX or ACCR(B) strains of rabbits gave either restricted responses when immunized with the pneumococcal vaccines. Three of the ACEP strain rabbits and two of the type III strain produced large quantities of highly restricted antibodies and were used to initiate structural studies on the antigen-combining site of antibody molecules. The rabbit antibodies were purified initially by affinity chromatography. The anti-SVIII antibodies were all eluted in a single fraction from an SVIII immunoadsorbent. The anti-SIII antibodies were all eluted in two fractions (one in various aqueous buffers and the other in guanidine-HCl) from an SIII immunoadsorbent. The specificially purified antibodies were examined analytically by isoelectric focusing in polyacrylamide gels and then were further fractionated by preparative liquid isoelectric focusing. Each purified antibody preparation from a restricted responder yielded 2-4 major electrofocused antibody fractions. The isoelectric point difference between the first and last eluted focused antibody fractions varied between 0{$\cdot$}2-0{$\cdot$}8 pH unit. The affinity chromatography and the isoelectric focusing procedures provide a successful means of preparatively obtaining different antibody fractions even from a single highly restricted antiserum. \textcopyright{} 1975.},

  abstract = {1. The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) chloride channel is activated by protein kinase A (PKA) phosphorylation of its R domain and by ATP binding at its nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs). Here we investigated the functional role of a cluster of acidic residues in the amino terminal tail (N-tail) that also modulate CFTR channel gating by an unknown mechanism. 2. A disease-associated mutant that lacks one of these acidic residues (D58N CFTR) exhibited lower macroscopic currents in Xenopus oocytes and faster deactivation following washout of a cAMP -activating cocktail than wild-type CFTR. 3. In excised membrane patches D58N CFTR exhibited a two-fold reduction in single channel open probability due primarily to shortened open channel bursts. 4. Replacing this and two nearby acidic residues with alanines (D47A, E54A, D58A) also reduced channel activity, but had negligible effects on bulk PKA phosphorylation or on the ATP dependence of channel activation. 5. Conversely, the N-tail triple mutant exhibited a markedly inhibited response to AMP-PNP, a poorly hydrolysable ATP analogue that can nearly lock open the wild-type channel. The N-tail mutant had both a slower response to AMP-PNP (activation half-time of 140 {$\pm$} 20 s vs. 21 {$\pm$} 4 s for wild type) and a lower steady-state open probability following AMP-PNP addition (0.68 {$\pm$} 0.08 vs. 0.92 {$\pm$} 0.03 for wild type). 6. Introducing the N-tail mutations into K1250A CFTR, an NBD2 hydrolysis mutant that normally exhibits very long open channel bursts, destabilized the activity of this mutant as evidenced by decreased macroscopic currents and shortened open channel bursts. 7. We propose that this cluster of acidic residues modulates the stability of CFTR channel openings at a step that is downstream of ATP binding and upstream of ATP hydrolysis, probably at NBD2.},

To achieve this goal, we turn to an importance-sampling algorithm, coined well-tempered metadynamics-extended adaptive biasing force (WTM-eABF), aimed at mapping rugged free-energy landscapes, combined with a path-searching algorithm, which we call multidimensional lowest energy (MULE), to identify the underlying minimum free-energy pathway in the collective-variable space of interest. First, the well-tempered feature of the importance-sampling scheme confers to the latter an asymptotic convergence, while the overall algorithm inherits the advantage of high sampling efficiency of its predecessor, meta-eABF, making its performance less sensitive to user-defined parameters. Second, the Dijkstra algorithm implemented in MULE is able to identify with utmost efficiency a pathway that satisfies minimum free energy of activation among all the possible routes in the multidimensional free-energy landscape. Numerical simulations of three molecular assemblies indicate that association of WTM-eABF and MULE constitutes a reliable, efficient and robust approach for exploring coupled movements in complex molecular objects. On account of its ease of use and intrinsic performance, we expect WTM-eABF and MULE to become a tool of choice for both experts and nonexperts interested in the thermodynamics and the kinetics of processes relevant to chemistry and biology.},

  abstract = {Peptide toxins have been valuable probes in efforts to identify amino acid residues that line the permeation pathway of cation-selective channels. However, no peptide toxins have been identified that interact with known anion-selective channels such as the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). CFTR channels are expressed in epithelial cells and are associated with several genetic disorders, including cystic fibrosis and polycystic kidney disease. Several organic inhibitors have been used to investigate the structure of the Cl- permeation pathway in CFTR. However, investigations of the wider cytoplasmic vestibule have been hindered by the lack of a high-affinity blocker that interacts with residues in this area. In this study we show that venom of the scorpion Leiurus quinquestriatus hebraeus reversibly inhibits CFTR, in a voltage-independent manner, by decreasing single-channel mean burst duration and open probability only when applied to the cytoplasmic surface of phosphorylated channels. Venom was able to decrease burst duration and open probability even when CFTR channels were locked open by treatment with either vanadate or adenosine 5{${'}$}-({$\beta$}, {$\gamma$}-imido)-triphosphate, and block was strengthened on reduction of extracellular Cl- concentration, suggesting inhibition by a pore-block mechanism. Venom had no effect on ATP-dependent macroscopic opening rate in channels studied by inside-out macropatches. Interestingly, the inhibitory activity was abolished by proteinase treatment. We conclude that a peptide toxin contained in the scorpion venom inhibits CFTR channels by a pore-block mechanism; these experiments provide the first step toward isolation of the active component, which would be highly valuable as a probe for CFTR structure and function.},

  abstract = {Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is a chloride channel belonging to the ATP binding cassette (ABC) protein superfamily. Currently, it remains unclear how ATP binding causes the opening of the channel gate at the molecular level. To clarify this mechanism, we first constructed an atomic model of the inward-facing CFTR using the X-ray structures of other ABC proteins. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were then performed to explore the structure and dynamics of the inward-facing CFTR in a membrane environment. In the MgATP-bound state, two nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs) formed a head-to-tail type of dimer, in which the ATP molecules were sandwiched between the Walker A and signature motifs. Alternatively, one of the final MD structures in the apo state was similar to that of a "closed-apo" conformation found in the X-ray analysis of ATP-free MsbA. Principal component analysis for the MD trajectory indicated that NBD dimerization causes significant structural and dynamical changes in the transmembrane domains (TMDs), which is likely indicative of the formation of a chloride ion access path. This study suggests that the free energy gain from ATP binding acts as a driving force not only for NBD dimerization but also for NBD-TMD concerted motions. \textcopyright{} 2012 American Chemical Society.}

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Half of adults with cystic fibrosis (CF) develop CF-related diabetes (CFRD). CFRD contributes to worsened pulmonary function and malnutrition. We undertook this study to determine the effect of cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR) modulators on CRFD. METHODS: We reviewed the medical records of adults with CF who followed in the CF clinic at Oklahoma University Medical Center. We collected data for age at diagnosis of CF and CFRD, CF mutations present, first date of ivacaftor therapy either alone or in combination, insulin use, pulmonary function, body mass index data, and home glucose monitoring results. Clinical resolution of CFRD was taken as discontinuation of routine insulin and resolution of high interstitial home glucose values. RESULTS: We identified 69 adult CF patients, of whom 31 had CFRD. Among these 14 CFRD patients taking ivacaftor alone or in combination, four patients completely stopped using insulin. Another patient went from three times a day pre-prandial insulin to using insulin once a week. Home blood glucose and hemoglobin A1c values supported resolution of CFRD. Three patients continued to have hypoglycemia despite stopping insulin. No CFRD patient not taking CFTR modulators markedly changed the insulin regimen. Pulmonary function was preserved in those patients with resolved CFRD (FEV1 +6.75\% {$\pm$}7.6), whereas it worsened in CFRD patients who either were not taking CFTR modulators (FEV1 -2.09\% {$\pm$}3.9) or who had no response of CFRD status (FEV1 -4.9\% {$\pm$}7.6). CONCLUSIONS: About one-third of patients on CFTR modulator therapy had resolution or near resolution of CFRD.},

In this protocol, we provide a general approach and standard setup protocol for MD simulations by using the Gromacs MD suite. [Background] While molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are increasingly getting popular in studying protein dynamics in silico, there is a strong need to correlate the results with experimental observations. It is necessary that the protein model and the chosen environment for the simulations should mimic the native environment as close as possible. In general, there are three key stages in molecular dynamics simulations: Setup, production run, and analysis of the trajectories. The setup includes the input structures, parameters, force-fields and topologies. However, the readymade setup and wrong parameters could adversely affect the outcome making a false assessment of the biological interpretation. In view of a manual setup as a better choice to setup simulations, we through this protocol, provide a general approach and standard setup protocol for MD simulations. Many online/offline tools are available to perform MD simulations. One amongst the open source tools is Gromacs (Abraham et al., 2015; Pronk et al., 2013; Van der Spoel et al.,2005), a robust and popular MD simulations suite available today which supports almost all the major force fields. In this protocol we also refer to simulations of membrane proteins previously performed in vacuum as a temporary alternative to simulations including the membrane.}

The method uniquely defines the length of simulation time required to achieve thermal equilibrium over a broad range of parameters, thus removing ambiguities associated with the traditional heuristic approaches. The proposed protocol saves simulation time and avoids bias introduced by the inclusion of non-equilibrium events. The key element of the procedure involves coupling only the solvent atoms to a standard heat bath. Measuring progress towards thermal equilibration involves simply monitoring the difference in temperature between the solvent and the protein. Here, we report that the results of MD simulations using the above procedure are measurably improved relative to the traditional approaches in terms of root-mean-square deviations and principal components analysis both indicating significantly less undesirable divergence.},

Cystic fibrosis (CF) patients have chronic inflammation in which oxidative stress can be a factor. To examine the hypothesis that the transport of GSH content was defective in CF patients, intracellular and extracellular GSH were measured by HPLC. Four cell lines were used: CFT1 cells [with defective CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), {$\Delta$}F508 homozygous, two clones] and one of the CFT1 clones transfected with either normal CFTR (CFTR repleted) or {$\beta$}-galactosidase. GSH content in the apical fluid was 55\% lower in CFTR-deficient cultures than in CFTR-repleted cells (P {$<$} 0.001). In contrast, intracellular GSH content was similar in CFT1 cells and CFTR-repleted cells. {$\gamma$}-Glutamyl transpeptidase activity, which degrades extracellular GSH, did not account for differences in apical GSH. Rather, GSH efflux of CFTR-deficient cells was lower than that of CFTR-repleted cells. These studies suggested that decreased GSH content in the apical fluid in CF resulted from abnormal GSH transport associated with a defective CFTR.},

  abstract = {Previous cysteine scanning studies of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) chloride channel have identified several transmembrane segments (TMs), including TM1, 3, 6, 9, and 12, as structural components of the pore. Some of these TMs such as TM6 and 12 may also be involved in gating conformational changes. However, recent results on TM1 seem puzzling in that the observed reactive pattern was quite different from those seen with TM6 and 12. In addition, whether TM1 also plays a role in gating motions remains largely unknown. Here, we investigated CFTR's TM1 by applying methanethiosulfonate (MTS) reagents from both cytoplasmic and extracellular sides of the membrane. Our experiments identified four positive positions, E92, K95, Q98, and L102, when the negatively charged MTSES was applied from the cytoplasmic side. Intriguingly, these four residues reside in the extracellular half of TM1 in previously defined CFTR topology; we thus extended our scanning to residues located extracellularly to L102. We found that cysteines introduced into positions 106, 107, and 109 indeed react with extracellularly applied MTS probes, but not to intracellularly applied reagents. Interestingly, whole-cell A107C-CFTR currents were very sensitive to changes of bath pH as if the introduced cysteine assumes an altered pKa-like T338C in TM6. These findings lead us to propose a revised topology for CFTR's TM1 that spans at least from E92 to Y109. Additionally, side-dependent modifications of these positions indicate a narrow region (L102-I106) that prevents MTS reagents from penetrating the pore, a picture similar to what has been reported for TM6. Moreover, modifications of K95C, Q98C, and L102C exhibit strong state dependency with negligible modification when the channel is closed, suggesting a significant rearrangement of TM1 during CFTR's gating cycle. The structural implications of these findings are discussed in light of the crystal structures of ABC transporters and homology models of CFTR.},

  abstract = {Experimental and computational studies have painted a picture of the chloride permeation pathway in cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) as a short narrow tunnel flanked by wider inner and outer vestibules. Although these studies also identified a number of transmembrane segments (TMs) as porelining, the exact location of CFTR's gate(s) remains unknown. Here, using a channel-permeant probe, [Au(CN)2]-, we provide evidence that CFTR bears a gate that coincides with the predicted narrow section of the pore defined as residues 338-341 in TM6. Specifically, cysteines introduced cytoplasmic to the narrow region (i.e., positions 344 in TM6 and 1148 in TM12) can be modified by intracellular [Au(CN)2]-, in both open and closed states, corroborating the conclusion that the internal vestibule does not harbor a gate. However, cysteines engineered to positions external to the presumed narrow region (e.g., 334, 335, and 337 in TM6) are all nonreactive toward cytoplasmic [Au(CN)2]-, in the absence of ATP, whereas they can be better accessed by extracellular [Au(CN)2]-, when the open probability ismarkedly reduced by introducing a second mutation, G1349D. As [Au(CN)2]-, and chloride ions share the same permeation pathway, these results imply a gate is situated between amino acid residues 337 and 344 along TM6, encompassing the very segment that may also serve as the selectivity filter for CFTR. The unique position of a gate in the middle of the ion translocation pathway diverges from those seen in ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters and thus distinguishes CFTR from other members of the ABC transporter family.},

Furthermore, phosphatidylinositol lipids occupy the binding site for capsaicin and other vanilloid ligands, suggesting a mechanism whereby chemical or thermal stimuli elicit channel activation by promoting release of bioactive lipids from a critical allosteric regulatory site.},

Conventional MD-based approaches rely on the first principles of statistical mechanics and assume equilibrium sampling of the phase space. In the current work we demonstrate that accurate absolute binding free energies (ABFE) can also be obtained via theoretically rigorous non-equilibrium approaches. Our investigation of ligands binding to bromodomains and T4 lysozyme reveals that both equilibrium and non-equilibrium approaches converge to the same results. The non-equilibrium approach achieves the same level of accuracy and convergence as an equilibrium free energy perturbation (FEP) method enhanced by Hamiltonian replica exchange. We also compare uni- and bi-directional non-equilibrium approaches and demonstrate that considering the work distributions from both forward and reverse directions provides substantial accuracy gains. In summary, non-equilibrium ABFE calculations are shown to yield reliable and well-converged estimates of protein\textendash ligand binding affinity.},

By contrast, CFTR is regarded as the only exit pathway for HCO(3)(-) in the airways. Here we show that Cl(-)/HCO(3)(-) anion exchange makes a major contribution to transcellular HCO(3)(-) transport in airway serous cells. Real-time measurement of intracellular pH from polarized cultures of human Calu-3 cells demonstrated cAMP/PKA-activated Cl(-)-dependent HCO(3)(-) transport across the luminal membrane via CFTR-dependent coupled Cl(-)/HCO(3)(-) anion exchange. The pharmacological and functional profile of the luminal anion exchanger was consistent with SLC26A4 (pendrin), which was shown to be expressed by quantitative RT-PCR, Western blot, and immunofluorescence. Pendrin-mediated anion exchange activity was confirmed by shRNA pendrin knockdown (KD), which markedly reduced cAMP-activated Cl(-)/HCO(3)(-) exchange. To establish the relative roles of CFTR and pendrin in net HCO(3)(-) secretion, transepithelial liquid secretion rate and liquid pH were measured in wild type, pendrin KD, and CFTR KD cells. cAMP/PKA increased the rate and pH of the secreted fluid. Inhibiting CFTR reduced the rate of liquid secretion but not the pH, whereas decreasing pendrin activity lowered pH with little effect on volume. These results establish that CFTR predominately controls the rate of liquid secretion, whereas pendrin regulates the composition of the secreted fluid and identifies a critical role for this anion exchanger in transcellular HCO(3)(-) secretion in airway serous cells.},

  abstract = {The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) Cl\textendash{} channel contains 12 transmembrane (TM) regions that are presumed to form the channel pore. However, little is known about the relative functional contribution of different TM regions to the pore. We have used patch clamp recording to investigate the functional consequences of point mutations throughout the six transmembrane regions in the N-terminal part of the CFTR protein (TM1-TM6). A range of specific functional assays compared the single channel conductance, anion binding, and anion selectivity properties of different channel variants. Overall, our results suggest that TM1 and -6 play dominant roles in forming the channel pore and determining its functional properties, with TM5 perhaps playing a lesser role. In contrast, TM2, -3, and -4 appear to play only minor supporting roles. These results define transmembrane regions 1 and 6 as major contributors to the CFTR channel pore and have strong implications for emerging structural models of CFTR and related ATP-binding cassette proteins.},

The primal solution is a choline chloride (ChCl)-urea mixture-based ionic liquid with nickel chloride hexahydrate (NiCl\textbackslash textlessinf\textbackslash textgreater2\textbackslash textless/inf\textbackslash textgreater{$\cdot$}6H\textbackslash textlessinf\textbackslash textgreater2\textbackslash textless/inf\textbackslash textgreaterO) dissolved. The proposed ionothermal protocol is attractive and environmental friendly because ChCl and urea are naturally biocompatible compounds. It has been reported that Ni(NH\textbackslash textlessinf\textbackslash textgreater3\textbackslash textless/inf\textbackslash textgreater)\textbackslash textlessinf\textbackslash textgreater6\textbackslash textless/inf\textbackslash textgreaterCl\textbackslash textlessinf\textbackslash textgreater2\textbackslash textless/inf\textbackslash textgreater is an indirect and reversible hydrogen storage material for fuel cells.

Interestingly, with the addition of a small amount of water into the primal solution which has been kept at 150 \textdegree C and open to the air for 40 minutes, NF {$\alpha$}-Ni(OH)\textbackslash textlessinf\textbackslash textgreater2\textbackslash textless/inf\textbackslash textgreater can be obtained. Further annealing of the NF {$\alpha$}-Ni(OH)\textbackslash textlessinf\textbackslash textgreater2\textbackslash textless/inf\textbackslash textgreater at 300 \textdegree C leads to the formation of NF-NiO with a mesoporous structure, which is demonstrated to be a promising pseudo-capacitive electrode material in a KOH aqueous solution. The rapid activation process, good cycling performance, and high specific capacitance of the NF-NiO electrode are attributed to its high surface area (72.9 m\textbackslash textlesssup\textbackslash textgreater2\textbackslash textless/sup\textbackslash textgreater g\textbackslash textlesssup\textbackslash textgreater-1\textbackslash textless/sup\textbackslash textgreater) and the mesoporous structure. We expect that the ionothermal method will have implications for the use of ChCl-urea mixture-based ionic liquids in the large-scale synthesis of advanced functional materials. \textcopyright{} The Royal Society of Chemistry 2013.}

The identification and development of new Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane conductance Regulator (CFTR) modulators is necessary to achieve higher clinical benefit in patients. In this report we describe the characterization of novel potentiators. From a small screening campaign on F508del CFTR, hits were developed leading to the identification of pre-clinical candidates GLPG1837 and GLPG2451, each derived from a distinct chemical series. Both drug candidates enhance WT CFTR activity as well as low temperature or corrector rescued F508del CFTR, and are able to improve channel activity on a series of Class III, IV CFTR mutants. The observed activities in YFP halide assays translated well to primary cells derived from CF lungs when measured using Trans-epithelial clamp circuit (TECC). Both potentiators improve F508del CFTR channel opening in a similar manner, increasing the open time and reducing the closed time of the channel. When evaluating the potentiators in a chronic setting on corrected F508del CFTR, no reduction of channel activity in presence of potentiator was observed. The current work identifies and characterizes novel CFTR potentiators GLPG1837 and GLPG2451, which may offer new therapeutic options for CF patients.},

However, detailed structure-function analyses have only been established for a few of them. This study aimed evaluating the impact of eight N-terminus CFTR natural missense changes on channel behavior. By site-directed mutagenesis, we generated four CFTR variants in the N-terminal cytoplasmic tail (p.P5L, p.S50P, p.E60K, and p.R75Q) and four in the first transmembrane segment of membrane-spanning domain 1 (p.G85E/V, p.Y89C, and p.E92K). Immunoblot analysis revealed that p.S50P, p.E60K, p.G85E/V, and p.E92K produced only core-glycosylated proteins. Immunofluorescence and whole cell patch-clamp confirmed intracellular retention, thus reflecting a defect of CFTR folding and/or trafficking. In contrast, both p.R75Q and p.Y89C had a glycosylation pattern and a subcellular distribution comparable to the wild-type CFTR, while the percentage of mature p.P5L was considerably reduced, suggesting a major biogenesis flaw on this channel. Nevertheless, whole-cell chloride currents were recorded for all three variants. Single-channel patch-clamp analyses revealed that the channel activity of p.R75Q appeared similar to that of the wild-type CFTR, while both p.P5L and p.Y89C channels displayed abnormal gating. Overall, our results predict a major impact of the CFTR missense variants analyzed, except p.R75Q, on the CF phenotype and highlight the importance of the CFTR N-terminus on channel physiology. \textcopyright{} 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Recent scientific advances have made genome editing more efficient, precise, and flexible than ever before. These advances have spurred an explosion of interest from around the globe in the possible ways in which genome editing can improve human health. The speed at which these technologies are being developed and applied has led many policymakers and stakeholders to express concern about whether appropriate systems are in place to govern these technologies and how and when the public should be engaged in these decisions. Human Genome Editing considers important questions about the human application of genome editing including: balancing potential benefits with unintended risks, governing the use of genome editing, incorporating societal values into clinical applications and policy decisions, and respecting the inevitable differences across nations and cultures that will shape how and whether to use these new technologies. This report proposes criteria for heritable germline editing, provides conclusions on the crucial need for public education and engagement, and presents 7 general principles for the governance of human genome editing.},

  abstract = {Intracellular trafficking of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is a focus of attention because it is defective in most patients with cystic fibrosis. DeltaF508 CFTR, which does not mature conformationally, normally does not exit the endoplasmic reticulum, but if induced to do so at reduced temperature is short-lived at the surface. We used external epitope-tagged constructs to elucidate the itinerary and kinetics of wild type and DeltaF508 CFTR in the endocytic pathway and visualized movement of CFTR from the surface to intracellular compartments. Modulation of different endocytic steps with low temperature (16 degrees C) block, protease inhibitors, and overexpression of wild type and mutant Rab GTPases revealed that surface CFTR enters several different routes, including a Rab5-dependent initial step to early endosomes, then either Rab11-dependent recycling back to the surface or Rab7-regulated movement to late endosomes or alternatively Rab9-mediated transit to the trans-Golgi network. Without any of these modulations DeltaF508 CFTR rapidly disappears from and does not return to the cell surface, confirming that its altered structure is detected in the distal as well as proximal secretory pathway. Importantly, however, the mutant protein can be rescued at the plasma membrane by Rab11 overexpression, proteasome inhibitors, or inhibition of Rab5-dependent endocytosis.},

  abstract = {Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a lethal recessive genetic disease caused primarily by the F508del mutation in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). The potentiator VX-770 was the first CFTR modulator approved by the FDA for treatment of CF patients with the gating mutation G551D. Orkambi is a drug containing VX-770 and corrector VX809 and is approved for treatment of CF patients homozygous for F508del, which has folding and gating defects. At least 30\% of CF patients are heterozygous for the F508del mutation with the other allele encoding for one of many different rare CFTR mutations. Treatment of heterozygous F508del patients with VX-809 and VX-770 has had limited success, so it is important to identify heterozygous patients that respond to CFTR modulator therapy. R117H is a more prevalent rare mutation found in over 2,000 CF patients. In this study we investigated the effectiveness of VX-809/VX-770 therapy on restoring CFTR function in human bronchial epithelial (HBE) cells from R117H/F508del CF patients. We found that VX-809 stimulated more CFTR activity in R117H/F508del HBEs than in F508del/F508del HBEs. R117H expressed exclusively in immortalized HBEs exhibited a folding defect, was retained in the ER, and degraded prematurely. VX-809 corrected the R117H folding defect and restored channel function. Because R117 is involved in ion conductance, VX-770 acted additively with VX-809 to restore CFTR function in chronically treated R117H/F508del cells. Although treatment of R117H patients with VX-770 has been approved, our studies indicate that Orkambi may be more beneficial for rescue of CFTR function in these patients.},

Culturing of epithelial cells with irradiated 3T3 fibroblast feeder cells plus the RhoA kinase inhibitor Y-27632 (Y), termed conditionally reprogrammed cell (CRC) technology, enhances cell growth and lifespan while preserving cell-of-origin functionality. We initially determined the electrophysiological and morphological characteristics of conventional versus CRC-expanded non-CF HBE cells. On the basis of these findings, we then created six CF cell CRC populations, three from sequentially obtained CF lungs and three from F508 del homozygous donors previously obtained and cryopreserved using conventional culture methods. Growth curves were plotted, and cells were subcultured, without irradiated feeders plus Y, into air-liquid interface conditions in nonproprietary and proprietary Ultroser G-containing media and were allowed to differentiate. Ussing chamber studies were performed after treatment of F508 del homozygous CF cells with the CFTR modulator VX-809. Bronchial epithelial cells grew exponentially in feeders plus Y, dramatically surpassing the numbers of conventionally grown cells. Passage 5 and 10 CRC HBE cells formed confluent mucociliary air-liquid interface cultures. There were differences in cell morphology and current magnitude as a function of extended passage, but the effect of VX-809 in increasing CFTR function was significant in CRC-expanded F508 del HBE cells. Thus, CRC technology expands the supply of functional primary CF HBE cells for testing CFTR modulators in Ussing chambers.},

  abstract = {Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations allow the exploration of the phase space of biopolymers through the integration of equations of motion of their constituent atoms. The analysis of MD trajectories often relies on the choice of collective variables (CVs) along which the dynamics of the system is projected. We developed a graphical user interface (GUI) for facilitating the interactive choice of the appropriate CVs. The GUI allows: defining interactively new CVs; partitioning the configurations into microstates characterized by similar values of the CVs; calculating the free energies of the microstates for both unbiased and biased (metadynamics) simulations; clustering the microstates in kinetic basins; visualizing the free energy landscape as a function of a subset of the CVs used for the analysis. A simple mouse click allows one to quickly inspect structures corresponding to specific points in the landscape.

  abstract = {The concept of absolute half-cell emf is discussed and defined as V MS-{$\varphi$}M for the reaction M\textrightarrow M+ (solution)+e -(M), where VMS is the electrostatic potential difference between metal electrode and solution and {$\varphi$}M the work function of metal in contact with solution. It is shown that this quantity is equal to VRS-{$\varphi$}R, where VRS is the electrostatic potential difference between a reference electrode in air above the solution and the solution, and {$\varphi$}R the work function in air of this reference. The quantity VRS{${'}$}, the potential difference between reference electrode and the solution surface, was found experimentally by the vibrating condenser method for a number of half-cells, and {$\varphi$}R was determined photoelectrically. It is shown from the variation of VRS{${'}$} with electrolyte concentration that the potential difference betwen the bulk of pure H2O and its air interface is {$\sim$}0.05 V, the surface being negative relative to bulk, and that this potential is increasingly screened out as electrolyte concentration increases. From these results for several different half- cells the absolute value of the standard half-cell emf for H2\textrightarrow 2H+ is found to be -4.73{$\pm$}0.05 V. This result permits the calculation of single ion free energies of solvation. It is shown that the simple Born model as used by Latimer, Pitzer, and Slansky works remarkably well for simple cations, including polyvalent ones, and for spherical anions, but breaks down for complex anions like OH-, NO3-, etc. Ions in which chemical bonding effects to the solvent play an important role show anomalously high solvation energies. The solvation energy of H+ is -10.98 eV in H 2O and varies very little from this value in several different solvents, suggesting that free H+ may predominate in these solvents. This could result from the fact that the small effective radius of free H + leads to a greater solvation energy than the combination of bond formation and solvation of the resultant much larger ion (H solvent) +. Similar arguments can be used to explain why for instance Fe 3+ is not reduced by H2O despite the fact that the third ionization potential of Fe is 30 and that of water 12.6 eV. Other possible applications of the method used in these experiments are discussed. Copyright \textcopyright{} 1977 American Institute of Physics.}

Here we show that the divalent anion Pt(NO2)42- acts as an impermeant voltage-dependent blocker of the CFTR pore when added to the intracellular face of excised membrane patches. Block was of modest affinity (apparent K d 556 {$\mu$}M), kinetically fast, and weakened by extracellular Cl - ions. A mutation in the pore region that alters anion selectivity, F337A, but not another mutation at the same site that has no effect on selectivity (F337Y), had a complex effect on channel block by intracellular Pt(NO2)42- ions. Relative to wild-type, block of F337A-CFTR was weakened at depolarized voltages but strengthened at hyperpolarized voltages. Current in the presence of Pt(NO2) 42- increased at very negative voltages in F337A but not wild-type or F337Y, apparently due to relief of block by permeation of Pt(NO2)42- ions to the extracellular solution. This "punchthrough" was prevented by extracellular Cl- ions, reminiscent of a "lock-in" effect. Relief of block in F337A by Pt(NO2)42- permeation was only observed for blocker concentrations above 300 {$\mu$}M; as a result, block at very negative voltages showed an anomalous concentration dependence, with an increase in blocker concentration causing a significant weakening of block and an increase in Cl- current. We interpret this effect as reflecting concentration-dependent permeability of Pt(NO2)4 2- in F337A, an apparent manifestation of an anomalous mole fraction effect. We suggest that the F337A mutation allows intracellular Pt(NO 2)42- to enter deeply into the CFTR pore where it interacts with multiple binding sites, and that simultaneous binding of multiple Pt(NO2)42- ions within the pore promotes their permeation to the extracellular solution.},

Here we investigate the origin of the voltage dependence of block by intracellular Au(CN)2-, a highly permeant lyotropic anion which also acts as a high-affinity blocker of Cl- permeation. Not only the affinity, but also the voltage dependence of block by intracellular Au(CN)2- ions is strongly dependent on extracellular Cl- concentration; following replacement of most extracellular Cl- by glucose or by impermeant anions, block by Au(CN)2- shows greatly weakened voltage dependence. This suggests that coupled movement of Au(CN)2- and Cl- ions within the pore contributes to the voltage dependence of block. This explanation requires that interactions between different anions take place within the pore, implying simultaneous binding of multiple anions to intrapore sites. Other anions are able to substitute for extracellular Cl- and interact with intracellular Au(CN 2- ions. Analysis of the effects of different extracellular anions on the apparent affinity and voltage dependence of block by intracellular Au(CN)2- ions suggests that extracellular anions do not need to permeate through the channel in order to destabilize Au(CN)2- binding within the pore, implying that this destabilizing effect results from binding to an externally accessible site in the permeation pathway. We propose that multiple anions can bind simultaneously within the CFTR channel pore, and that repulsive interactions between bound anions speeds anion exit from the pore.},

In agreement with the experiments that demonstrate the influence of electrostatic potential on the thrombin/aptamer complex, our computations show that the application of positive electric field successfully unbinds the thrombin from the aptamer. Results from umbrella sampling simulations reveal that there is a decrease in the free energy of binding between the thrombin and aptamer in presence of positive electric fields. Hydrogen bonding and non-bonded interaction energies, and hence the free energy of binding, between the thrombin and its aptamer reduce as the applied electric field is shifted from negative to positive values. Our analyses demonstrate that application of electrical stimulus modifies the molecular interactions within the complex and consequently, electrical field can be used to modulate the association between the thrombin and its aptamer.}

It would be of interest to assess the extent that Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (CFTR), a functional channel, fits the ATP Switch model for ABC transporters. Additional transporter mechanisms, namely those of Pgp and HlyB, are discussed for perspective. Literature search of databases selected key references in comparing and contrasting the gating mechanism. CFTR is a functional chloride channel facilitating transmembrane anion flow down electrochemical gradients. A dysfunctional CFTR protein results in cystic fibrosis, a fatal pleiotropic disease currently managed symptomatically.

In this work, the performance of benign solvents, namely deep eutectic solvents (DES), in the separation of aromatic-aliphatic hydrocarbon azeotropic mixtures via liquid-liquid extraction (LLE) was evaluated. The DES studied in this work were based on different ammonium salts (cholinium chloride, [Ch]Cl, benzylcholinium chloride, [BzCh]Cl, and tetrabutylammonium chloride, [N4444]Cl) as hydrogen bond acceptor (HBA) and one organic acid (levulinic acid, LevA) as hydrogen bond donor (HBD), always in the mole ratio of 1 HBA:2 HBD. The thermophysical properties, namely density and viscosity, of the three used DES were measured in the temperature range T = (293.15 up to 353.15) K and at atmospheric pressure. The phase equilibria diagrams of all ternary systems were determined at T = 298.15 K and at atmospheric pressure using 1H NMR spectroscopy. The results showed that the introduction of a more hydrophobic HBA in the DES promotes the improvement of the distribution coefficient, while playing with the aromaticity of the DES leads to higher selectivity. In addition, the performance of the predictive conductor-like screening model for real solvent (COSMO-RS) model in the description of these systems was also evaluated. COSMO-RS is capable of quantitatively predicting the phase behavior and tie-lines for ternary mixtures containing DES as well as of estimating the trend of distribution ratio and selectivity.},

An unbalance in this concentration can lead to neuronal death and to severe neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's or Parkinson's. Glutamate transporters play a crucial role in this respect because they are responsible for the reuptake of the neurotransmitter from the synaptic cleft, thus controlling the glutamate concentration. Understanding the molecular mechanism of this transporter can provide the possibility of an exogenous control. Structural studies have shown that this transporter can assume at least three conformations, thus suggesting a pronounced dynamical behavior. However, some intermediate states that lead to the substrate internalization have not been characterized and many aspects of the transporter mechanism still remain unclear. Here, using metadynamics simulations, we investigate the substrate uptake from the synaptic cleft and its release in the intracellular medium. In addition, we focus on the role of ions and substrate during these processes and on the stability of the different conformations assumed by the transporter. The present dynamical results can complement available X-ray data and provide a thorough description of the entire process of substrate uptake, internalization, and release.},

  abstract = {The Transient Receptor Potential (TRP) protein superfamily is a group of cation channels expressed in various cell types and involved in respiratory diseases such as cystic fibrosis (CF), the genetic disease caused by CF Transmembrane conductance Regulator (CFTR) mutations. In human airway epithelial cells, there is growing evidence for a functional link between CFTR and TRP channels. TRP channels contribute to transmitting extracellular signals into the cells and, in an indirect manner, to CFTR activity via a Ca2+ rise signaling. Indeed, mutated CFTR-epithelial cells are characterized by an increased Ca2+ influx and, on the opposite, by a decreased of magnesium influx, both being mediated by TRP channels. This increasing cellular Ca2+ triggers the activation of calcium-activated chloride channels (CaCC) or CFTR itself, via adenylyl cyclase, PKA and tyrosine kinases activation, but also leads to an exaltation of the inflammatory response. Another shortcoming in mutated CFTR-epithelial cells is a [Mg2+]i decrease, associated with impaired TRPM7 functioning. This deregulation has to be taken into consideration in CF physiopathology, as Mg2+ is required for ATP hydrolysis and CFTR activity. The modulation of druggable TRP channels could supplement CF therapy either an anti-inflammatory drug or for CFTR potentiation, according to the balance between exacerbation and respite phases. The present paper focus on TRPA1, TRPC6, TRPM7, TRPV2, TRPV4, TRPV6 and ORAI 1, the proteins identified, for now, as dysfunctional channels, in CF cells.},

CD has the advantage that measurements may be made on multiple samples containing {$\leq$}20 {$\mu$}g of proteins in physiological buffers in a few hours. However, it does not give the residue-specific information that can be obtained by x-ray crystallography or NMR.},

The present work attempts to resolve this difficulty using molecular dynamics simulations with the AMOEBA polarizable force field and perturbation techniques to directly compute absolute solvation free energies for potassium, sodium, and chloride ions in liquid water and formamide. Corresponding calculations are also performed with two widely used nonpolarizable force fields. The simulations with the polarizable force field accurately reproduce in vacuo quantum mechanical results, experimental ion-cluster solvation enthalpies, and experimental solvation free energies for whole salts, while the other force fields do not. The results indicate that calculations with a polarizable force field can capture the thermodynamics of ion solvation and that the solvation free energies of the individual ions differ by several kilocalories from commonly cited values.},

Our method aims at rare events, which currently cannot be predicted with traditional molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, since these currently are limited to time scales shorter than a few nanoseconds. Given an initial conformation of the system, our method identifies one or more product states, which may be separated from the initial state by free energy barriers that are large on the scale of thermal energy. It also provides an approximate reaction path, which can be used to determine barrier heights or reaction rates with the usual techniques. The method employs an artificial potential that destabilizes the initial conformation and, thereby, lowers free energy barriers of structural transitions. As a result, transitions are accelerated and may be observed in MD simulations. An analytical estimate for the acceleration factor is given. The method is applied to two test systems, an argon microcluster and a simplified protein model. By these studies we demonstrated that our method is capable of shortening mean transition times from 0.5 s (argon cluster) and 1.4 ns (protein model) to a few picoseconds. These results suggest that our method is particularly well suited to study biochemically relevant conformational motions in proteins at a microsecond time scale. \textcopyright{} 1995 The American Physical Society.}

Interestingly, selfassembled nanoporous network of Ag films with ligament and channel width in the range of 20-80 nm was formed on the copper alloy substrate from 0.01 M AgCl DES solution either at room temperature or at 50 \textdegree C. The as-deposited porous Ag films exhibited hydrophilic properties.

While RL biases the data generation process towards arbitrary metrics, the GAN component of the reward function ensures that the model still remembers information learned from data. We build upon previous results that incorporated GANs and RL in order to generate sequence data and test this model in several settings for the generation of molecules encoded as text sequences (SMILES) and in the context of music generation, showing for each case that we can effectively bias the generation process towards desired metrics.},

CFTR modulators are a novel class of drugs that directly target the molecular defect. CFTR modulators include potentiators that result in improved activity of the channel; correctors that help the protein traffic to the cell surface properly; and readthrough agents that restore full-length CFTR by suppression of premature termination codons, among other novel classes more recently established. While some of these drugs, CFTR potentiators in particular, have provided remarkable improvements for CF patients, others have yet to achieve profoundly improved outcomes, and many CF patients are not yet impacted by CFTR modulators due to lack of knowledge regarding susceptibility of their mutations to treatment. One limitation to expanding these types of therapies to the maximum number of patients with CF is the lack of rigorously validated clinical biomarkers that can determine efficacy on an individual basis, as well as few pre-clinical tools that can predict whether an individual with a rare combination of mutant alleles will respond to a particular CFTR modulator regimen. In this review, we discuss the various groups of CFTR modulators and their status in clinical development, as well as address the current literature on biomarkers, pre-clinical cellbased tools, and the role of pharmacometrics in creating therapeutic strategies to improve the lives of all patients with cystic fibrosis, regardless of their specific mutation.},

  abstract = {The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator forms an anion- selective channel. We previously showed that charge selectivity, the ability to discriminate between anions and cations, occurs near the cytoplasmic end of the channel. The molecular determinants of charge selectivity, however, are unknown. We investigated the role of Arg352, a residue flanking the predicted cytoplasmic end of the M6 segment, in the mechanism of charge selectivity. We determined the Cl- to Na+ permeability ratio (P(Cl)/P(Na)) from the reversal potential measured in a 10-fold NaCl gradient. For the wild type, P(Cl)/P(Na) was 36 (range of 28-51). For the R352H mutant, P(Cl)/P(Na) was dependent on cytoplasmic pH. At pH 5.4, the P(Cl)/P(Na) was 33 (range of 27-41), similar to that of the wild type, but at pH 7.2, where the histidine should be largely uncharged, P(Cl)/P(Na) was 3 (range of 2.9-3.1). For the R352C and R352Q mutants, P(Cl)/P(Na) was 7 (range of 6-8) and 4 (range of 3.5-4.4), respectively. Furthermore, Na+ which does not carry a significant fraction of the current through the wild type is measurably conducted through R352Q. Thus, the charge of the side chain at position 352 is a strong determinant of charge selectivity. In the wild type, the positive charge on Arg352 contributes to an electrostatic potential in the channel that forms a barrier to cation permeation. Mutation of Arg352 did not alter the halide selectivity sequence. Selectivity among halides must involve other residues.},

Taking advantage of this, we performed molecular dynamics simulations of the translocon in a fully solvated lipid bilayer, examining the translocation abilities of monomeric SecYE{$\beta$} by forcing two helices comprised of different amino acid sequences to cross the channel. The simulations revealed that the so-called plug of SecYE{$\beta$} swings open during translocation, closing thereafter. Likewise, it was established that the so-called pore ring region of SecYE{$\beta$} forms an elastic, yet tight, seal around the translocating oligopeptides. The closed state of the channel was found to block permeation of all ions and water molecules; in the open state, ions were blocked. Our results suggest that the SecYE{$\beta$} monomer is capable of forming an active channel.},

The ultimate goal of such detailed simulations is to produce trajectories in which the behavior of the system is as realistic as possible. A critical aspect that requires consideration in the case of biological membrane systems is the existence of a net electric potential difference across the membrane. For meaningful computations, it is important to have well validated methodologies for incorporating the latter in molecular dynamics simulations. A widely used treatment of the membrane potential in molecular dynamics consists of applying an external uniform electric field E perpendicular to the membrane. The field acts on all charged particles throughout the simulated system, and the resulting applied membrane potential V is equal to the applied electric field times the length of the periodic cell in the direction perpendicular to the membrane. A series of test simulations based on simple membrane-slab models are carried out to clarify the consequences of the applied field. These illustrative tests demonstrate that the constant-field method is a simple and valid approach for accounting for the membrane potential in molecular dynamics studies of biomolecular systems.

  abstract = {Although the concept of an artificial photosynthetic reaction center that mimics natural electron-and energy-transfer processes is an old one, in recent years major advances have occurred. In this review, some relatively simple molecular dyads that mimic certain aspects of photosynthetic electron transfer and singlet or triplet energy transfer are described. Dyads of this type have proven to be extremely useful for elucidating basic photochemical principles. In addition, their limitations, particularly in the area of temporal stabilization of electronic charge separation, have inspired the development of much more complex multicomponent molecular devices. The use of the basic principles of photoinitiated electron transfer to engineer desirable properties into the more complex species is exemplified. The multiple electrontransfer pathways available with these molecules make it possible to fine-tune the systems in ways that are impossible with simpler molecules. The study of these devices not only contributes to our understanding of natural photosynthesis, but also aids in the design of artificial solar energy harvesting systems and provides an entry into the nascent field of molecular electronics.},

  abstract = {Deep eutectic solvents (DESs) have been used in the synthesis of nitrogen-doped carbons exhibiting a hierarchical porous structure. The CO 2 sorption capacity of these solid sorbents was extraordinary because of their relatively high nitrogen content and their bimodal porous structure where micropores provide high surface areas (ca. 700 m 2 g -1) and macropores provide accessibility to such a surface. DESs were composed of resorcinol, 3-hydroxypyridine and choline chloride in 2:2:1 and 1:1:1 molar ratios. Polycondensation of resorcinol and 3-hydroxypyridine (with formaldehyde) promoted DES segregation in a spinodal-like decomposition process by the formation of a polymer rich phase and a depleted polymer phase. Thus, DESs played a multiple role in the synthetic process; the liquid medium that ensured reagents homogenization, the structure-directing agent that is responsible for the achievement of the hierarchical structure, and the source of carbon and nitrogen of the solid sorbent obtained after carbonization. Interestingly, the homogeneous incorporation of nitrogen at the solution stage of the synthetic process (rather than by post-treatment of the preformed carbon) allowed the achievement of significant nitrogen contents even in carbons obtained at relatively high temperatures (e.g. 8-12 at\% for 600 \textdegree C and ca. 5 at\% for 800 \textdegree C). It is worth noting that, despite thermal treatments at high temperatures tend to decrease the nitrogen content, the high surface area of the solid sorbents obtained at 800 \textdegree C contributed to a significant enhancement of CO 2 capture while providing superior selectivity, recyclability and stability. \textcopyright{} 2011 The Royal Society of Chemistry.}

All DESs showed good ability to extract thiophene with the best extraction efficiency (35\%) being observed for the sulfolane-based DES. The extraction efficiency can be further enhanced to reach 98\% when five extraction cycles are performed. Moreover, the DESs were easily regenerated using rotary evaporation. In addition,1H NMR analysis is used to elucidate the extraction mechanism. Finally, the COSMO-RS model was used to predict the ternary tie lines for the studied systems and the NRTL model allowed, correlating the experimental data with an average root-mean-square deviation of {$<$}2\% for all DESs.

This article illustrates concepts and results of geometric numerical integration on the important example of the St\"ormer\textendash Verlet method. It thus presents a cross-section of the recent monograph by the authors, enriched by some additional material.             After an introduction to the Newton\textendash St\"ormer\textendash Verlet\textendash leapfrog method and its various interpretations, there follows a discussion of geometric properties: reversibility, symplecticity, volume preservation, and conservation of first integrals. The extension to Hamiltonian systems on manifolds is also described. The theoretical foundation relies on a backward error analysis, which translates the geometric properties of the method into the structure of a modified differential equation, whose flow is nearly identical to the numerical method. Combined with results from perturbation theory, this explains the excellent long-time behaviour of the method: long-time energy conservation, linear error growth and preservation of invariant tori in near-integrable systems, a discrete virial theorem, and preservation of adiabatic invariants.},

Defining conformational states, however, remains a difficult and increasingly common problem, with many existing methods based on arbitrary or potentially unrepresentative measures. Furthermore, the expanding length of molecular dynamics simulations and direct observation of transitions between different energy basins suggest that this issue will only become evermore important. Methods commonly used to characterize conformational states include principal component analysis, root-mean-square deviation-based clustering, and geometric measurements such as hinge angles and distances. Here we present a method where the eigenvector frequencies derived from a Gaussian network model (Bahar, I.; Atilgan, A. R.; Erman, B. Folding Des. 1997, 2, 173-181) of a trajectory of structures from a molecular dynamics simulation are used to describe the state of the protein at each time point. We apply the method to three proteins that share the same fold as the type II periplasmic binding proteins: The lysine-arginine-ornithine-binding protein, the glutamine-binding protein, and the ligand-binding domain from the NR1 N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor. We find that the method can distinguish different states in good agreement with a variety of previous analyses and additionally provides information on the dynamic properties of that system at a given time point. \textcopyright{} 2007 American Chemical Society.}

This study examined the coefficient of fat absorption (CFA), symptoms, quality of life (QoL) and the accuracy of faecal elastase-1 (FE-1) measurement to predict PEI. METHODS: Forty patients were analysed following resection for pancreatic malignancy. The primary endpoint was PEI diagnosis defined by CFA {$<$}93\%; secondary endpoints were PEI diagnosis using FE-1 {$<$}200 {$\mu$}g/g, body mass index (BMI), and symptom and QoL analysis. Interventions were 3-day stool collection, EORTC QLQ-C30 (version 1) questionnaire and patient's diary, at 6 weeks and 3, 6 and 12 months after surgery. RESULTS: CFA {$<$}93\% was present in 67\% of patients at 6 weeks and in 55\% at 12 months. PEI using FE-1 was present in 77 and 83\% of patients, respectively. No significant changes between time-points were observed. Sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV and accuracy for FE-1 in detecting CFA {$<$}93\% were 91, 35, 70, 71 and 70\%, respectively. CFA and FE-1 levels were uncorrelated. Overall, QoL increased at 6 (p = 0.0212) and 12 (p {$<$} 0.0001) months after surgery, mainly driven by physical, role and social functioning, and by appetite. Importantly, however, BMI and symptoms were unaffected by PEI, which suggests a subclinical presentation; such patients had attributes indicating poorer QoL (notably insomnia, p = 0.0012). CONCLUSIONS: PEI was common and sustained following resection and not associated with significant symptoms. These patients had a tendency toward poorer QoL. FE-1 is a poor surrogate for diagnosing impaired fat absorption. Postoperative pancreatic enzyme replacement should be considered more routinely. and IAP.},

The first and fourth extracytoplasmic loops (ELs) contain {$\sim$}15 and 30 residues, respectively; the other four ELs are extremely short. To examine the influence of missense mutants in ELs detected in patients with cystic fibrosis, we have expressed them in mammalian (baby hamster kidney (BHK21)) cells and assessed their biosynthetic processing and chloride channel activity. In contrast to previous findings that 18 of 30 disease-associated missense mutations in cytoplasmic loops caused retention of the nascent polypeptides in the endoplasmic reticulum, all the EL mutants studied matured and were transported to the cell surface. This pronounced asymmetry is consistent with the notion that endoplasmic reticulum quality control of nascent CFTR is exerted primarily on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane. Although this set of EL mutations has little effect on CFTR maturation, most of them seriously compromise its chloride channel activity. Substitutions at six different positions in EL1 and single positions in EL2 and EL4 all destabilized the open state, some of them severely, indicating that the ELs contribute to the stability of the CFTR ion pore.}

Key to the manipulation of the particle assembly is an understanding of the interaction between the particles and solvent. Here, we employ a comprehensive in situ approach, together with ex situ SEM imaging, to study supported palladium nanoparticles, electrodeposited from a 2:1 urea:choline Cl- DES. Using cyclic voltammetry, we confirm the expected adsorption of electroactive species onto the deposited particles. On the basis of our experimental results, we conclude that the electrodeposited nanoparticles assemble into 2-D superstructures, rich in adsorbed species. The abundance of these adsorbed species, within the superstructure, induces an anionic layer above them, which can be observed by ultrasmall-angle X-ray scattering (USAXS) as well as electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The surface charge of the particles is, therefore, not neutralized locally, as is the case with traditional colloidal systems. We also show that these otherwise stable nanoparticles readily aggregate when the DES is removed. Thus, the stability of these particles is contingent upon the presence of the DES. \textcopyright{} 2013 American Chemical Society.}

To expand treatment eligibility, we stably expressed 43 rare missense CFTR variants associated with moderate CF from a single site in the genome of human CF bronchial epithelial (CFBE41o-) cells. The magnitude of drug response was highly correlated with residual CFTR function for the potentiator ivacaftor, the corrector lumacaftor, and ivacaftor-lumacaftor combination therapy. Response of a second set of 16 variants expressed stably in Fischer rat thyroid (FRT) cells showed nearly identical correlations. Subsets of variants were identified that demonstrated statistically significantly higher responses to specific treatments. Furthermore, nearly all variants studied in CFBE cells (40 of 43) and FRT cells (13 of 16) demonstrated greater response to ivacaftor-lumacaftor combination therapy than either modulator alone. Together, these variants represent 87\% of individuals in the CFTR2 database with at least 1 missense variant. Thus, our results indicate that most individuals with CF carrying missense variants are (a) likely to respond modestly to currently available modulator therapy, while a small fraction will have pronounced responses, and (b) likely to derive the greatest benefit from combination therapy.},

  abstract = {Background: The advent of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator protein (CFTR) modulators like ivacaftor have revolutionised the treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF). However, due to the plethora of variances in disease manifestations in CF, there are inherent challenges in unified responses under CFTR modulator treatment arising from variability in patient outcomes. The pharmacokinetic (PK) data available for ivacaftor-lumacaftor cystic fibrosis (CF) transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) modulator drug combination is limited., Methods: Secondary objectives were to identify (1) patient characteristics and (2) the interactions between ivacaftor-lumacaftor responsible for interindividual variability (IIV)., Results: Peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) of ivacaftor - lumacaftor were {$>$}10 fold lower than expected compared to label information. The one-way ANOVA indicated that the patient site had an effect on Cmax values of ivacaftor metabolites ivacaftor-M1, ivacaftor-M6, and lumacaftor (p {$<$} 0.001, p {$<$} 0.001, and p {$<$} 0.001, respectively). The Spearman's rho test indicated that patient weight and age have an effect on the Cmax of lumacaftor (p = 0.003 and p {$<$} 0.001, respectively) and ivacaftor metabolite M1 (p = 0.020 and p {$<$} 0.001, respectively). Age (p {$<$} 0.001) was found to effect on Cmax of ivacaftor M6 and on Tmax of ivacaftor M1 (p = 0.026). A large impact of patient characteristics on the IIV of PK parameters Cmax and Tmax, was observed among the CF patients., Conclusion: Understanding the many sources of variability can help reduce this individual patient variability and ensure consistent patient outcomes.},

  abstract = {The outlier flooding method (OFLOOD) has been proposed as an enhanced conformational sampling method of proteins. In OFLOOD, rarely occurring states of proteins are detected as sparse conformational distributions (outliers) with a clustering algorithm. The detected outliers are intensively resampled with short-time molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. As a set of cycles, OFLOOD repeats selections of outliers and their conformational resampling. Herein, as an essential issue to be tackled to perform OFLOOD efficiently, a selection rule for outliers should be carefully specified. Generally, many outliers are detected from distributions on conformational subspaces with the clustering. Judging from its computational costs, it is unreasonable to select all the detected outliers upon the conformational resampling. Therefore, it is important to consider which outliers should be selected from the sparse distributions when restarting their short-time MD simulations with limited computational costs. In this sense, we investigated the conformational sampling efficiency of OFLOOD by changing the selection rules for outliers. To address the conformational sampling efficiency of OFLOOD depending on its selection rules, outliers to be resampled were selected by focusing their probability occurrences (populations of outliers). As a comparison, a random selection rule for outliers was also considered. Through the present assessment, the random selection of outliers showed the most efficient conformational sampling efficiency compared to the other OFLOOD trials using the biased selection rules, indicating that a variety of outliers should be selected and resampled during the OFLOOD cycles. In conclusion, the random outlier selection rule is the best strategy to perform OFLOOD efficiently.}

These proteins and the different steps of the endocytic process that they mediate have been studied in detail. However, we still lack a good understanding of how all these different components work together in a highly coordinated manner to drive vesicle formation. Nevertheless, studies in recent years have provided several important insights into how endocytic vesicles are built, starting from initiation, cargo loading and the mechanisms governing membrane bending to membrane scission and the release of the vesicle into the cytoplasm.},

  abstract = {The multilevel summation method (MSM) offers an efficient algorithm utilizing convolution for evaluating long-range forces arising in molecular dynamics simulations. Shifting the balance of computation and communication, MSM provides key advantages over the ubiquitous particle-mesh Ewald (PME) method, offering better scaling on parallel computers and permitting more modeling flexibility, with support for periodic systems as does PME but also for semiperiodic and nonperiodic systems. The version of MSM available in the simulation program NAMD is described, and its performance and accuracy are compared with the PME method. The accuracy feasible for MSM in practical applications reproduces PME results for water property calculations of density, diffusion constant, dielectric constant, surface tension, radial distribution function, and distancedependent Kirkwood factor, even though the numerical accuracy of PME is higher than that of MSM. Excellent agreement between MSM and PME is found also for interface potentials of air-water and membrane-water interfaces, where long-range Coulombic interactions are crucial. Applications demonstrate also the suitability of MSM for systems with semiperiodic and nonperiodic boundaries. For this purpose, simulations have been performed with periodic boundaries along directions parallel to a membrane surface but not along the surface normal, yielding membrane pore formation induced by an imbalance of charge across the membrane. Using a similar semiperiodic boundary condition, ion conduction through a graphene nanopore driven by an ion gradient has been simulated. Furthermore, proteins have been simulated inside a single spherical water droplet. Finally, parallel scalability results show the ability of MSM to outperform PME when scaling a system of modest size (less than 100 K atoms) to over a thousand processors, demonstrating the suitability of MSM for large-scale parallel simulation.},

In these DESs the molar ratio of choline chloride to urea, ethylene glycol and glycerol is 1:2. Results showed that the polarity and hydrogen bond donor ability of the DESs decreases with increasing mole fraction of dimethyl sulfoxide as a molecular solvent, while hydrogen bond acceptor ability of the media increases with mole fraction of DMSO. Deviation from ideal behavior, observed for solvatochromic parameters, confirmed preferential solvation of the solutes in these media. On the other hand, molecular dynamic simulations and quantum mechanics calculations concluded interaction energies between DES components and showed clearly different compositions in the solvation shells of the solutes in the solvent mixtures.},

  abstract = {Molecular dynamics simulations of biomolecules produce a very high dimensional time-series dataset. Performing analysis necessarily involves projection onto a lower dimensional space. A priori selection of projection coordinates requires (perhaps unavailable) prior information or intuition about the system. At best, such a projection can only confirm the intuition. At worst, a poor projection can obscure new features of the system absent from the intuition. Previous statistical methods such a time-structure based independent component analysis (tICA) and Markov state modeling (MSMs) have offered relatively unbiased means of projecting conformations onto coordinates or state labels, respectively. These analyses are underpinned by the propagator formalism and the assumption that slow dynamics are biologically interesting. Although arising from the same mathematics, tICA and MSMs have different strengths and weaknesses. We introduce a unifying method which we term ``landmark kernel tICA'' (lktICA) which uses a variant of the Nystr\"om kernel approximation to permit approximate non-linear solutions to the tICA problem. We show that lktICA is equivalent to MSMs with ``soft'' states. We demonstrate the advantages of this united method by finding improved projections of (a) a 1D potential surface (b) a peptide folding trajectory and (c) an ion channel conformational change.}

The reaction, which involves gamma phosphate cleavage from ATP, converting it to ADP, has been suggested to occur via an associative or dissociative mechanism dependent upon the surrounding environment. Prior quantum chemical studies suffered from short simulation time scales failing to capture free energy contributions due to relaxation of the surrounding aqueous environment. We have developed a highly parallelized QM/MM implementation in the NAMD and OpenAtom simulation packages, using the dual grid, dual length scale method for combined plane-wave and Euler exponential spline-based QM/MM simulations. This approach, using message-driven parallel quantum and classical dynamics, permits sufficient time scale simulations for quantum chemical events such as ATP hydrolysis and is found to accurately and reliably include the free energy contributions of solvent relaxation to hydrolysis. In this paper, we describe the application of the dual grid, dual length plane-wave-based QM/MM method to study both the associative and dissociative mechanisms of ATP hydrolysis, accounting for the free energy contribution from solvent relaxation, as well as for the key role of Mg 2+ in the reaction. \textcopyright{} 2012 American Chemical Society.}

  abstract = {The advent of Cystic fibrosis transmembrane receptor (CFTR) modulators in 2012 was a critical event in the history of cystic fibrosis (CF) treatment. Unlike traditional therapies that target downstream effects of CFTR dysfunction, CFTR modulators aim to correct the underlying defect at the protein level. These genotype-specific therapies are now available for an increasing number of CF patients, transforming the way we view the condition from a life-limiting disease to one that can be effectively managed. Several studies have demonstrated the vast improvement CFTR modulators have on normalization of sweat chloride, CFTR function, clinical endpoints, and frequency of pulmonary exacerbation. However, their impact on other aspects of the disease, such as pathogenic burden and airway infection, remain under explored. Frequent airway infections as a result of increased susceptibility and impaired innate immune response are a serious problem within CF, often leading to accelerated decline in lung function and disease progression. Current evidence suggests that CFTR modulators are unable to eradicate pathogenic organisms in those with already established lung disease. However, this may not be the case for those with relatively low levels of disease progression and conserved microbial diversity, such as young patients. Furthermore, it remains unknown whether the restorative effects exerted by CFTR modulators extend to immune cells, such as phagocytes, which have the potential to modulate the response of people with CF (pwCF) to infection. Throughout this review, we look at the potential impact of CFTR modulators on airway infection in CF and their ability to shape impaired pulmonary defences to pathogens.},

Here we report the cryo-EM 3D structure of the human Bact spliceosome at 3.4 \AA{} resolution. In the Bact state, the spliceosome is activated but not catalytically primed, so that it is functionally blocked prior to the first catalytic step of splicing. The spliceosomal core is similar to the yeast Bact spliceosome; important differences include the presence of the RNA helicase aquarius and peptidyl prolyl isomerases. To examine the overall dynamic behavior of the purified spliceosome, we developed a principal component analysis-based approach. Calculating the energy landscape revealed eight major conformational states, which we refined to higher resolution. Conformational differences of the highly flexible structural components between these eight states reveal how spliceosomal components contribute to the assembly of the spliceosome, allowing it to generate a dynamic interaction network required for its subsequent catalytic activation. A new approach to analyzing cryo-EM data reports on conformational dynamics in the human spliceosome.}

It is found that the effect of weak fields on ionic hydration can be neglected. Strong fields greatly disturb the water orientation in the hydration shells of ions, though ion coordination number remains almost unchanged. Under strong fields, the first hydration shell of ions is significantly weakened and the ion-water interaction energy is dramatically reduced; surprisingly, the second hydration shells of Cl- and Na+ are slightly structured because of the optimal water orientation; moreover, ionic hydration structures become asymmetrical along the field direction because of the uniformly aligned water dipoles. Compared with Na+ and Pb2+, the hydration of Cl- is less disturbed by external fields, probably ascribed to the different water reorientation around anions and cations as well as the different structure-maker/breaker nature of the ions. Additionally, strong fields significantly enhance ion mobility and remarkably shorten the water residence time in the hydration shell. This work demonstrates that applying strong fields is an effective way to weaken ion hydration.}

We tested template-free structure prediction with a challenging TM CASP14 target and several TM protein structures published after AlphaFold2 training.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) modulators correct the basic defect caused by CFTR mutations. Improvements in health outcomes have been achieved with the combination of a CFTR corrector and potentiator in people with cystic fibrosis homozygous for the F508del mutation. The addition of elexacaftor (VX-445), a next-generation CFTR corrector, to tezacaftor plus ivacaftor further improved F508del-CFTR function and clinical outcomes in a phase 2 study in people with cystic fibrosis homozygous for the F508del mutation. METHODS: This phase 3, multicentre, randomised, double-blind, active-controlled trial of elexacaftor in combination with tezacaftor plus ivacaftor was done at 44 sites in four countries. Eligible participants were those with cystic fibrosis homozygous for the F508del mutation, aged 12 years or older with stable disease, and with a percentage predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 s (ppFEV1) of 40-90\%, inclusive. After a 4-week tezacaftor plus ivacaftor run-in period, participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to 4 weeks of elexacaftor 200 mg orally once daily plus tezacaftor 100 mg orally once daily plus ivacaftor 150 mg orally every 12 h versus tezacaftor 100 mg orally once daily plus ivacaftor 150 mg orally every 12 h alone. The primary outcome was the absolute change from baseline (measured at the end of the tezacaftor plus ivacaftor run-in) in ppFEV1 at week 4. Key secondary outcomes were absolute change in sweat chloride and Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire-Revised respiratory domain (CFQ-R RD) score. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03525548. FINDINGS: Between Aug 3 and Dec 28, 2018, 113 participants were enrolled. Following the run-in, 107 participants were randomly assigned (55 in the elexacaftor plus tezacaftor plus ivacaftor group and 52 in the tezacaftor plus ivacaftor group) and completed the 4-week treatment period. The elexacaftor plus tezacaftor plus ivacaftor group had improvements in the primary outcome of ppFEV1 (least squares mean [LSM] treatment difference of 10{$\cdot$}0 percentage points [95\% CI 7{$\cdot$}4 to 12{$\cdot$}6], p{$<$}0{$\cdot$}0001) and the key secondary outcomes of sweat chloride concentration (LSM treatment difference -45{$\cdot$}1 mmol/L [95\% CI -50{$\cdot$}1 to -40{$\cdot$}1], p{$<$}0{$\cdot$}0001), and CFQ-R RD score (LSM treatment difference 17{$\cdot$}4 points [95\% CI 11{$\cdot$}8 to 23{$\cdot$}0], p{$<$}0{$\cdot$}0001) compared with the tezacaftor plus ivacaftor group. The triple combination regimen was well tolerated, with no discontinuations. Most adverse events were mild or moderate; serious adverse events occurred in two (4\%) participants receiving elexacaftor plus tezacaftor plus ivacaftor and in one (2\%) receiving tezacaftor plus ivacaftor. INTERPRETATION: Elexacaftor plus tezacaftor plus ivacaftor provided clinically robust benefit compared with tezacaftor plus ivacaftor alone, with a favourable safety profile, and shows the potential to lead to transformative improvements in the lives of people with cystic fibrosis who are homozygous for the F508del mutation.

Their biocompatibility was determined by long-term measurement of the overall mean relative enzyme activities. These were maximally reduced by about 10-15\% when up to 200 g IL l-1 was added. Sitting-drop vapor diffusion crystallization experiments revealed that the addition of some of the ILs led to less crystal polymorphism and precipitation was avoided reliably even at larger NaCl concentrations. The addition of ILs tended to result in larger crystals. The kinetics of lysozyme crystallization were significantly enhanced using ILs as crystallization additives, e.g. by a factor of 5.5 when 100 g ethanolammonium formate l-1 was added. ILs with "soft" anions, such as formate or glycolate, were superior to ILs with "hard" anions, like nitrate. \textcopyright{} 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

Chaperones of the Hsp70 class and their partner proteins interact with nascent polypeptide chains on ribosomes and prevent their premature (mis)folding at least until a domain capable of forming a stable structure is synthesized. For many proteins, completion of folding requires the subsequent interaction with one of the large oligomeric ring-shaped proteins of the chaperonin family, which is composed of the GroEL-like proteins in eubacteria, mitochondria, and chloroplasts, and the TRiC family in eukaryotic cytosol and archaea. These proteins bind partially folded polypeptide in their central cavity and promote folding by ATP-dependent cycles of release and rebinding. In these reactions, molecular chaperones interact predominantly with the hydrophobic surfaces exposed by nonnative polypeptides, thereby preventing incorrect folding and aggregation.},

  abstract = {Enhanced sampling algorithms have emerged as powerful methods to extend the potential of molecular dynamics simulations and allow the sampling of larger portions of the configuration space of complex systems. This review aims to present the unifying principles and differences of several computational methods for enhanced sampling in molecular simulations of biomolecules, soft matter and molecular crystals. Indeed, despite the apparent abundance and divergence of such methods, the principles at their core can be boiled down to a few statistical and physical principles. To enable comparisons, the various methods are introduced using the same terminology and notation. We then illustrate in which ways many different methods combine principles from a smaller class of enhanced sampling concepts. This review is intended for scientists with an understanding of the basics of molecular dynamics simulations and statistical physics who want a deeper understanding of the ideas that underlie various enhanced sampling methods and the relationships between them. We expect this to help scientists make informed decisions about which method to use. This ``living'' review is intended to be updated to continue to reflect the wealth of sampling methods as they emerge in the literature.},

Although the derivation of the algorithm is presented in terms of matrices, no matrix matrix multiplications are needed and only the nonzero matrix elements have to be stored, making the method useful for very large molecules. At the same accuracy, the LINCS algorithm is three to four times faster than the SHAKE algorithm. Parallelization of the algorithm is straightforward. \textcopyright{} 1997 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.

Changes to the membrane environment including lipid composition, specifically lipid microdomains, may be responsible for enabling capacitation. To study the effect of lipid environment on proteins, liposomes were created using lipids extracted from bull sperm membranes, with or without a protein (Na+ K+-ATPase or {$\alpha$}-amylase). Protein incorporation, function, and orientation were determined. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) confirmed protein inclusion in the lipid bilayer, and protein function was confirmed using a colourometric assay of phosphate production from ATP cleavage. In the native lipid liposomes, ATPase was oriented with the {$\beta$} subunit facing the outer leaflet, while changing the lipid composition to 50\% native lipids and 50\% exogenous lipids significantly altered this orientation of Na+ K+-ATPase within the membranes.},

Parameters are explored for multicomponent bilayers composed of unsaturated lipids DOPC and DOPE, mixed-chain saturation POPC and POPE, and anionic lipids found in bacteria: POPG and cardiolipin. A nonbond representation obtained from multiscale force matching is adapted for these lipids and combined with an improved bonding description of cholesterol. Equilibrating the area per lipid yields robust bilayer simulations and properties for common lipid mixtures with the exception of pure DOPE, which has a known tendency to form nonlamellar phase. The models maintain consistency with an existing lipid-protein interaction model, making the force field of general utility for studying membrane proteins in physiologically representative bilayers.},

Five nonbasic and six basic nitrogen compounds were included in this study. The activity coefficient at infinite dilution, {$\gamma\infty$}, of each nitrogen compound in the DESs was predicted; and the values are used to screen the DESs on the basis of selectivity, capacity, and performance index at infinite dilution (S{$\infty$}, C{$\infty$}, and PI). The extraction of nitrogen compounds using DES is driven by hydrogen-bonding interaction. It was found that nonbasic compounds report higher S{$\infty$} and C{$\infty$} than basic compounds. Ammonium-based DESs give higher S{$\infty$} but phosphonium-based DESs report higher C{$\infty$}. DESs combined with Cl-anion give higher S{$\infty$}, but those with Br-anion report higher C{$\infty$}. DESs with alcohol- and amide-based HBDs give higher S{$\infty$} but HBDs with carboxylic acid group report high C{$\infty$}. Molar ratio has little effect toward S{$\infty$} and C{$\infty$}. DESs with high values of S{$\infty$} generally have high PI.}

The performance of each DES was determined from the distribution ratio and selectivity values calculated using experimental (liquid + liquid) equilibrium data of the ternary systems ethylbenzene + n-octane + DESs. The DES with only ethylene glycol had a high selectivity but a low distribution ratio, whereas the DES with only pyridine had a high distribution ratio but a low selectivity. For the other DESs, adding pyridine increased the distribution ratio, and increasing the molar ratio of ethylene glycol increased the selectivity. Generally, whenever the selectivity increased, the distribution ratio decreased, and vice versa. The nonrandom two-liquid model was used to correlate the experimental data, and the average root mean square deviation (RMSD) between correlated and experimental tie lines was 1.4\%. Moreover, the Conductor-like Screening Model for Real Solvents was successfully used to predict the ternary tie lines for the studied systems with an average RMSD of 3.7\%.},

In this work and based on our previous predictions, tetrabutylammonium bromide + ethylene glycol and tetrabutylphosphonium bromide + ethylene glycol DESs at molar ratio 1:2 were explored experimentally for the removal of pyrrole, pyridine, indoline and quinoline from a model diesel compound, n-hexadecane. Ternary (liquid + liquid) equilibrium experiments were conducted at room temperature with nitrogen concentrations in the feed ranging from (5 to 50) wt\%. 1H NMR spectroscopy was used for compositional analysis of the extract and raffinate phases. No amount of the solvent in the raffinate phases was detected; indicating minimal cross contamination. Also, it was found that all systems exhibit Type I phase behavior with positive slopes which indicate that small amount of solvents is required to remove the nitrogen compounds. Moreover, the distribution ratio and selectivity values are all greater than unity with higher values reported for non-basic nitrogen compounds. COSMO-RS predictions of the ternary tie lines were in good agreement with experimental data with average RMSD value of 2.51\%. The experimental data were also well correlated with NRTL model with average RMSD value of 0.60\%.},

  abstract = {Most proteins assemble into multisubunit complexes1. The persistence of these complexes across evolutionary time is usually explained as the result of natural selection for functional properties that depend on multimerization, such as intersubunit allostery or the capacity to do mechanical work2. In many complexes, however, multimerization does not enable any known function3. An alternative explanation is that multimers could become entrenched if substitutions accumulate that are neutral in multimers but deleterious in monomers; purifying selection would then prevent reversion to the unassembled form, even if assembly per se does not enhance biological function3\textendash 7. Here we show that a hydrophobic mutational ratchet systematically entrenches molecular complexes. By applying ancestral protein reconstruction and biochemical assays to the evolution of steroid hormone receptors, we show that an ancient hydrophobic interface, conserved for hundreds of millions of years, is entrenched because exposure of this interface to solvent reduces protein stability and causes aggregation, even though the interface makes no detectable contribution to function. Using structural bioinformatics, we show that a universal mutational propensity drives sites that are buried in multimeric interfaces to accumulate hydrophobic substitutions to levels that are not tolerated in monomers. In a database of hundreds of families of multimers, most show signatures of long-term hydrophobic entrenchment. It is therefore likely that many protein complexes persist because a simple ratchet-like mechanism entrenches them across evolutionary time, even when they are functionally gratuitous.},

  abstract = {The concept of homeostasis has been inextricably linked to the function of the kidneys for more than a century when it was recognized that the kidneys had the ability to maintain the "internal milieu" and allow organisms the "physiologic freedom" to move into varying environments and take in varying diets and fluids. Early ingenious, albeit rudimentary, experiments unlocked a wealth of secrets on the mechanisms involved in the formation of urine and renal handling of the gamut of electrolytes, as well as that of water, acid, and protein. Recent scientific advances have confirmed these prescient postulates such that the modern clinician is the beneficiary of a rich understanding of the nephron and the kidney's critical role in homeostasis down to the molecular level. This review summarizes those early achievements and provides a framework and introduction for the new CJASN series on renal physiology.},

However, this experimental information deals with inactive states of the channel, either in an apo, quiescent conformation, in which nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs) are widely separated or in an ATP-bound, yet closed conformation. Here, we show that 3D structure models of the open and closed forms of the channel, now further supported by metadynamics simulations and by comparison with the cryo-EM data, could be used to gain some insights into critical features of the conformational transition toward active CFTR forms. These critical elements lie within membrane-spanning domains but also within NBD1 and the N-terminal extension, in which conformational plasticity is predicted to occur to help the interaction with filamin, one of the CFTR cellular partners.},

ATP-binding cassette (ABC) exporters are highly dynamic membrane proteins that extrude a wide range of substances from the cytosol4\textendash 6 and thereby contribute to essential cellular processes, adaptive immunity and multidrug resistance7,8. Despite their importance, the coupling of nucleotide binding, hydrolysis and release to the conformational dynamics of these proteins remains poorly resolved, especially for heterodimeric and/or asymmetric ABC exporters that are abundant in humans. Here we present eight high-resolution cryo-EM structures that delineate the full functional cycle of an asymmetric ABC exporter in a lipid environment. Cryo-EM analysis under active turnover conditions reveals distinct inward-facing (IF) conformations\textemdash one of them with a bound peptide substrate\textemdash and previously undescribed asymmetric post-hydrolysis states with dimerized nucleotide-binding domains and a closed extracellular gate. By decreasing the rate of ATP hydrolysis, we could capture an outward-facing (OF) open conformation\textemdash an otherwise transient state vulnerable to substrate re-entry. The ATP-bound pre-hydrolysis and vanadate-trapped states are conformationally equivalent; both comprise co-existing OF conformations with open and closed extracellular gates. By contrast, the post-hydrolysis states from the turnover experiment exhibit asymmetric ATP and ADP occlusion after phosphate release from the canonical site and display a progressive separation of the nucleotide-binding domains and unlocking of the intracellular gate. Our findings reveal that phosphate release, not ATP hydrolysis, triggers the return of the exporter to the IF conformation. By mapping the conformational landscape during active turnover, aided by mutational and chemical modulation of kinetic rates to trap the key intermediates, we resolved fundamental steps of the substrate translocation cycle of asymmetric ABC transporters.},

This book argues that the key to understanding selves and consciousness is a special kind of abstract feedback loop inhabiting our brains. Deep down, a human brain is a chaotic soup of particles, on a higher level it is a jungle of neurons, and on a yet higher level it is a network of abstractions that we call "symbols." The most central and complex symbol in your brain or mine is the one we both call "I."

The quantum theory of nuclear magnets is presented within a strong physical framework, supported by figures. The book assumes only a basic knowledge of complex numbers and matrices, and provides the reader with numerous worked examples and exercises to encourage understanding. With the explicit aim of carefully developing the subject from the beginning, the text starts with coverage of quarks and nucleons and progresses through to a detailed explanation of several important NMR experiments, including NMR imaging, COSY, NOESY and TROSY. Completely revised and updated, the Second Edition features new material on the properties and distributions of isotopes, chemical shift anisotropy and quadrupolar interactions, Pake patterns, spin echoes, slice selection in NMR imaging, and a complete new chapter on the NMR spectroscopy of quadrupolar nuclei. New appendices have been included on Euler angles, and coherence selection by field gradients. As in the first edition, all material is heavily supported by graphics, much of which is new to this edition. Written for undergraduates and postgraduate students taking a first course in NMR spectroscopy and for those needing an up-to-date account of the subject, this multi-disciplinary book will appeal to chemical, physical, material, life, medical, earth and environmental scientists. The detailed physical insights will also make the book of interest for experienced spectroscopists and NMR researchers. \textbullet{} An accessible and carefully written introduction, designed to help students to fully understand this complex and dynamic subject \textbullet{} Takes a multi-disciplinary approach, focusing on basic principles and concepts rather than the more practical aspects \textbullet{} Presents a strong pedagogical approach throughout, with emphasis placed on individual spins to aid understanding \textbullet{} Includes numerous worked examples, problems, further reading and additional notes **Praise from the reviews of the First Edition:** \_"This is an excellent book... that many teachers of NMR spectroscopy will cherish...\_ \_It deserves to be a `classic' among NMR spectroscopy texts\_\_."\_ NMR IN BIOMEDICINE \_"I strongly recommend this book to everyone\textbackslash ldotsit is probably the best modern comprehensive description of the subject."\_ ANGEWANDTE CHEMIE, INTERNATIONAL EDITION},

  abstract = {Previous studies have shown that the method of hydrogen mass repartitioning (HMR) is a potentially useful tool for accelerating molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. By repartitioning the mass of heavy atoms into the bonded hydrogen atoms, it is possible to slow the highest-frequency motions of the macromolecule under study, thus allowing the time step of the simulation to be increased by up to a factor of 2. In this communication, we investigate further how this mass repartitioning allows the simulation time step to be increased in a stable fashion without significantly increasing discretization error. To this end, we ran a set of simulations with different time steps and mass distributions on a three-residue peptide to get a comprehensive view of the effect of mass repartitioning and time step increase on a system whose accessible phase space is fully explored in a relatively short amount of time. We next studied a 129-residue protein, hen egg white lysozyme (HEWL), to verify that the observed behavior extends to a larger, more-realistic, system. Results for the protein include structural comparisons from MD trajectories, as well as comparisons of pKa calculations via constant-pH MD. We also calculated a potential of mean force (PMF) of a dihedral rotation for the MTS [(1-oxyl-2,2,5,5-tetramethyl-pyrroline-3-methyl)methanethiosulfonate] spin label via umbrella sampling with a set of regular MD trajectories, as well as a set of mass-repartitioned trajectories with a time step of 4 fs. Since no significant difference in kinetics or thermodynamics is observed by the use of fast HMR trajectories, further evidence is provided that long-time-step HMR MD simulations are a viable tool for accelerating MD simulations for molecules of biochemical interest.},

On the basis of detectable anti-EA and/or the early absence and late emergence of anti-EBNA, four of these 14 individuals showed evidence of a current or very recent primary Epstein-Barr virus infection. The other ten patients showed antibody patterns indicative of Epstein-Barr virus infections in the past, and no firm conclusions could be drawn with regard to the specificity of their heterophil reactions. It was assumed, however, that some represented atypical clinical forms of EBV infection and that timing of specimen collection was a factor in explaining the paucity of Downey cells. In three patients, the absorbed heterophil-positive reactions persisted with little change in titer for at least 22 mo and thus might represent false-positive tests.},

E1 enzymes activate UBLs by catalysing UBL carboxy-terminal adenylation, forming a covalent E1 {$\sim$} UBL thioester intermediate, and generating a thioester-linked E2 {$\sim$} UBL product, which must be released for subsequent reactions. Here we report the structural analysis of a trapped UBL activation complex for the human NEDD8 pathway, containing NEDD8's heterodimeric E1 (APPBP1-UBA3), two NEDD8s (one thioester-linked to E1, one noncovalently associated for adenylation), a catalytically inactive E2 (Ubc12), and MgATP. The results suggest that a thioester switch toggles E1-E2 affinities. Two E2 binding sites depend on NEDD8 being thioester-linked to E1. One is unmasked by a striking E1 conformational change. The other comes directly from the thioester-bound NEDD8. After NEDD8 transfer to E2, reversion to an alternate E1 conformation would facilitate release of the E2 {$\sim$} NEDD8 thioester product. Thus, transferring the UBL's thioester linkage between successive conjugation enzymes can induce conformational changes and alter interaction networks to drive consecutive steps in UBL cascades. \textcopyright 2007 Nature Publishing Group.}

  abstract = {Ewald summation, which has become the de facto standard for computing electrostatic interactions in biomolecular simulations, formally requires that the simulation box is neutral. For non-neutral systems, the Ewald algorithm implicitly introduces a uniform background charge distribution that effectively neutralizes the simulation box. Because a uniform distribution of counter charges typically deviates from the spatial distribution of counterions in real systems, artifacts may arise, in particular in systems with an inhomogeneous dielectric constant. Here, we derive an analytical expression for the effect of using an implicit background charge instead of explicit counterions, on the chemical potential of ions in heterogeneous systems, which (i) provides a quantitative criterium for deciding if the background charge offers an acceptable trade-off between artifacts arising from sampling problems and artifacts arising from the homogeneous background charge distribution, and (ii) can be used to correct this artifact in certain cases. Our model quantifies the artifact in terms of the difference in charge density between the non-neutral system with a uniform neutralizing background charge and the real neutral system with a physically correct distribution of explicit counterions. We show that for inhomogeneous systems, such as proteins and membranes in water, the artifact manifests itself by an overstabilization of ions inside the lower dielectric by tens to even hundreds kilojoules per mole. We have tested the accuracy of our model in molecular dynamics simulations and found that the error in the calculated free energy for moving a test charge from water into hexadecane, at different net charges of the system and different simulation box sizes, is correctly predicted by the model. The calculations further confirm that the incorrect distribution of counter charges in the simulation box is solely responsible for the errors in the PMFs.},

We demonstrate the direct binding of VX-809 to the first nucleotide-binding domain (NBD1) of human CFTR. Disruption of the interaction between C-terminal helices and the NBD1 core upon VX-809 binding is observed from chemical shift changes in the NMR spectra of residues in the helices and on the surface of b-strands S3, S9, and S10. Binding to VX-809 leads to a significant negative shift in NBD1 thermal melting temperature (Tm), pointing to direct VX-809 interaction shifting the NBD1 conformational equilibrium. An inter-residue correlation analysis of the chemical shift changes provides evidence of allosteric coupling between the direct binding site and the NBD1:CL4 interface, thus enabling effects on the interface in the absence of direct binding in that location. These NMR binding data and the negative Tm shifts are very similar to those previously reported by us for binding of the dual corrector-potentiator CFFT-001 to NBD1 (Hudson et al., 2012), suggesting that the two compounds may share some aspects of their mechanisms of action. Although previous studies have shown an important role for VX-809 in modulating the conformation of the first membrane spanning domain (Aleksandrov et al., 2012; Ren et al., 2013), this additional mode of VX-809 binding provides insight into conformational dynamics and allostery within CFTR.},

The atoms displayed in each representation are chosen using an extensive atom selection syntax, which includes Boolean operators and regular expressions. VMD provides a complete graphical user interface for program control, as well as a text interface using the Tcl embeddable parser to allow for complex scripts with variable substitution, control loops, and function calls. Full session logging is supported, which produces a VMD command script for later playback. High-resolution raster images of displayed molecules may be produced by generating input scripts for use by a number of photorealistic image-rendering applications. VMD has also been expressly designed with the ability to animate molecular dynamics (MD) simulation trajectories, imported either from files or from a direct connection to a running MD simulation. VMD is the visualization component of MDScope, a set of tools for interactive problem solving in structural biology, which also includes the parallel MD program NAMD, and the MDCOMM software used to connect the visualization and simulation programs. VMD is written in C++, using an object-oriented design; the program, including source code and extensive documentation, is freely available via anonymous ftp and through the World Wide Web.},

Extracellular gate opening and closure are key steps of the transport cycle, but the underlying mechanism is poorly understood. Here, we generated a synthetic single domain antibody (sybody) that recognizes the heterodimeric ABC exporter TM287/288 exclusively in the presence of ATP, which was essential to solve a 3.2\,\AA{} crystal structure of the outward-facing transporter. The sybody binds to an extracellular wing and strongly inhibits ATPase activity by shifting the transporter's conformational equilibrium towards the outward-facing state, as shown by double electron-electron resonance (DEER). Mutations that facilitate extracellular gate opening result in a comparable equilibrium shift and strongly reduce ATPase activity and drug transport. Using the sybody as conformational probe, we demonstrate that efficient extracellular gate closure is required to dissociate the NBD dimer after ATP hydrolysis to reset the transporter back to its inward-facing state.},

First, it is the only ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter that is known to be an ion channel-almost all others function as transport ATPases. Second, CFTR is the only ligand-gated channel that consumes its ligand (ATP) during the gating cycle-a consequence of its enzymatic activity as an ABC transporter. We discuss these special properties of CFTR in the context of its evolutionary history as an ABC transporter. Other topics include the mechanisms by which CFTR gating is regulated by phosphorylation of its unique regulatory domain and our current view of the CFTR permeation pathway (or pore). Understanding these basic operating principles of the CFTR channel is central to defining the mechanisms of action of prospective cystic fibrosis drugs and to the development of new, rational treatment strategies. \textcopyright{} 2013 Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press; all rights reserved.},

We present atomistic Molecular Dynamics simulations of the core of {$\alpha$}-synuclein using enhanced sampling techniques to describe the conformational and binding free energy landscapes of fragments implicated in fibril stabilization. The theoretical framework is derived to combine the free energy profiles of the fragments into the reaction free energy of a protein binding to a fibril. Our study shows that individual fragments in solution have a propensity toward attaining non-{$\beta$} conformations, indicating that in a fibril {$\beta$}-strands are stabilized by interactions with other strands. We show that most dimers of hydrogen-bonded fragments are unstable in solution, while hydrogen bonding stabilizes the collective binding of five fragments to the end of a fibril. Hydrophobic effects make further contributions to the stability of fibrils. This study is the first of its kind where structural and binding preferences of the five major fragments of the hydrophobic core of {$\alpha$}-synuclein have been investigated. This approach improves sampling of intrinsically disordered proteins, provides information on the binding mechanism between the core sequences of {$\alpha$}-synuclein, and enables the parametrization of coarse grained models.}

  abstract = {The ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter superfamily includes many proteins of clinical relevance, with genes expressed in all domains of life. Although most members use the energy of ATP binding and hydrolysis to accomplish the active import or export of various substrates across membranes, the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is the only known animal ABC transporter that functions primarily as an ion channel. Defects in CFTR, which is closely related to ABCC subfamily members that bear function as bona fide transporters, underlie the lethal genetic disease cystic fibrosis. This article seeks to integrate structural, functional, and genomic data to begin to answer the critical question of how the function of CFTR evolved to exhibit regulated channel activity. We highlight several examples wherein preexisting features in ABCC transporters were functionally leveraged as is, or altered by molecular evolution, to ultimately support channel function. This includes features that may underlie (1) construction of an anionic channel pore from an anionic substrate transport pathway, (2) establishment and tuning of phosphoregulation, and (3) optimization of channel function by specialized ligand\textendash channel interactions. We also discuss how divergence and conservation may help elucidate the pharmacology of important CFTR modulators.}

We observe an enrichment of cholesterol in the outer leaflet and a general non-ideal lateral mixing of the different lipid species. Transient domains with liquid-ordered character form and disappear on the microsecond time scale. These domains are coupled across the two membrane leaflets. In the outer leaflet, distinct nanodomains consisting of gangliosides are observed. Phosphoinositides show preferential clustering in the inner leaflet. Our data provide a key view on the lateral organization of lipids in one of lifes fundamental structures, the cell membrane.}

By modulation of these properties, membrane protein function can be affected. Furthermore, inhomogeneous lipid mixing and domains of lipid enrichment/depletion can sort proteins and provide optimal local environments. Recent coarse-grained (CG) Martini molecular dynamics efforts have provided glimpses into lipid organization of different PMs: an "Average"and a "Brain"PM. Their high complexity and large size require long simulations ({$\sim$}80 {$\mu$}s) for proper sampling. Thus, these simulations are computationally taxing. This level of complexity is beyond the possibilities of all-atom simulations, raising the question - what complexity is needed for "realistic"bilayer properties? We constructed CG Martini PM models of varying complexity (63 down to 8 different lipids). Lipid tail saturations and headgroup combinations were kept as consistent as possible for the "tissues'"(Average/Brain) at three levels of compositional complexity. For each system, we analyzed membrane properties to evaluate which features can be retained at lower complexity and validate eight-component bilayers that can act as reliable mimetics for Average or Brain PMs. Systems of reduced complexity deliver a more robust and malleable tool for computational membrane studies and allow for equivalent all-atom simulations and experiments.},

We propose here a change in perspective that shifts the focus from the bias to the probability distribution reconstruction while retaining some of the key characteristics of metadynamics, such as flexible on-the-fly adjustments to the free energy estimate. The result is an enhanced sampling method that presents a drastic improvement in convergence speed, especially when dealing with suboptimal and/or multidimensional sets of collective variables. The method is especially robust and easy to use and in fact requires only a few simple parameters to be set, and it has a straightforward reweighting scheme to recover the statistics of the unbiased ensemble. Furthermore, it gives more control of the desired exploration of the phase space since the deposited bias is not allowed to grow indefinitely and it does not push the simulation to uninteresting high free energy regions. We demonstrate the performance of the method in a number of representative examples.},

The bias potential is a function of a few collective variables and is gradually modified according to the underlying free energy surface. We show that when the collective variables are suboptimal, there is an exploration\textendash convergence tradeoff, and one must choose between a quickly converging bias that will lead to fewer transitions or a slower to converge bias that can explore the phase space more efficiently but might require a much longer time to produce an accurate free energy estimate. The recently proposed on-the-fly probability enhanced sampling (OPES) method focuses on fast convergence, but there are cases where fast exploration is preferred instead. For this reason, we introduce a new variant of the OPES method that focuses on quickly escaping metastable states at the expense of convergence speed. We illustrate the benefits of this approach in prototypical systems and show that it outperforms the popular metadynamics method.},

  abstract = {Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is an inherited disease caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) ion channel. Mutations in CFTR cause impaired chloride ion transport in the epithelial tissues of patients leading to cardiopulmonary decline and pancreatic insufficiency in the most severely affected patients. CFTR is composed of twelve membrane-spanning domains, two nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs), and a regulatory domain. The most common mutation in CFTR is a deletion of phenylalanine at position 508 ({$\delta$}F508) in NBD1. Previous research has primarily concentrated on the structure and dynamics of the NBD1 domain; However numerous pathological mutations have also been found in the lesser-studied NBD2 domain. We have investigated the amino acid coevolved network of interactions in NBD2, and the changes that occur in that network upon the introduction of CF and CF-related mutations (S1251N(T), S1235R, D1270N, N1303K (T)). Extensive coupling between the {$\alpha$}- and {$\beta$}-subdomains were identified with residues in, or near Walker A, Walker B, H-loop and C-loop motifs. Alterations in the predicted residue network varied from moderate for the S1251T perturbation to more severe for N1303T. The S1235R and D1270N networks varied greatly compared to the wildtype, but these CF mutations only affect ion transport preference and do not severely disrupt CFTR function, suggesting dynamic flexibility in the network of interactions in NBD2. Our results also suggest that inappropriate interactions between the {$\beta$}-subdomain and Q-loop could be detrimental. We also identified mutations predicted to stabilize the NBD2 residue network upon introduction of the CF and CF-related mutations, and these predicted mutations are scored as benign by the MUTPRED2 algorithm. Our results suggest the level of disruption of the coevolution predictions of the amino acid networks in NBD2 does not have a straightforward correlation with the severity of the CF phenotypes observed.}

To predict the microscopic origins of their voltage\textendash conductance characteristics, here we applied dissipation-corrected targeted molecular dynamics in combination with Langevin equation simulations to potassium diffusion through the gramicidin A channel as a test system. Performing a nonequilibrium principal component analysis on backbone dihedral angles, we find coupled protein-ion dynamics to occur during ion transfer. The dissipation-corrected free energy profiles correspond well to predictions from other biased simulation methods. The incorporation of an external electric field in Langevin simulations enables the prediction of macroscopic observables in the form of I\textendash V characteristics.},

  abstract = {Atomistic description of protein fibril formation has been elusive due to the complexity and long time scales of the conformational search. Here, we develop a multiscale approach combining numerous atomistic simulations in explicit solvent to construct Markov State Models (MSMs) of fibril growth. The search for the in-register fully bound fibril state is modeled as a random walk on a rugged two-dimensional energy landscape defined by {$\beta$}-sheet alignment and hydrogen-bonding states, whereas transitions involving states without hydrogen bonds are derived from kinetic clustering. The reversible association/dissociation of an incoming peptide and overall growth kinetics are then computed from MSM simulations. This approach is applied to derive a parameter-free, comprehensive description of fibril elongation of A{$\beta$}16\textendash 22 and how it is modulated by phenylalanine-to-cyclohexylalanine (CHA) mutations. The trajectories show an aggregation mechanism in which the peptide spends most of its time trapped in misregistered {$\beta$}-sheet states connected by weakly bound states twith short lifetimes. Our results recapitulate the experimental observation that mutants CHA19 and CHA1920 accelerate fibril elongation but have a relatively minor effect on the critical concentration for fibril growth. Importantly, the kinetic consequences of mutations arise from cumulative effects of perturbing the network of productive and nonproductive pathways of fibril growth. This is consistent with the expectation that nonfunctional states will not have evolved efficient folding pathways and, therefore, will require a random search of configuration space. This study highlights the importance of describing the complete energy landscape when studying the elongation mechanism and kinetics of protein fibrils.},

Our code can efficiently scale up to the entire Summit supercomputer, reaching 86 PFLOPS in double precision (43\% of the peak) and 137 PFLOPS in mixed precision.

  abstract = {Free Energy Perturbation with Replica Exchange Molecular Dynamics (FEP/REMD) offers a powerful strategy to improve the convergence of free energy computations. In particular, it has been shown previously that a FEP/REMD scheme allowing random moves within an extended replica ensemble of thermodynamic coupling parameters ``lambda'' can improve the statistical convergence in calculations of absolute binding free energy of ligands to proteins [J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2009, 5, 2583]. In the present study, FEP/REMD is extended and combined with an accelerated MD simulations method based on Hamiltonian replica-exchange MD (H-REMD) to overcome the additional problems arising from the existence of kinetically trapped conformations within the protein receptor. In the combined strategy, each system with a given thermodynamic coupling factor lambda in the extended ensemble is further coupled with a set of replicas evolving on a biased energy surface with boosting potentials used to accelerate the inter-conversion among different rotameric states of the side chains in the neighborhood of the binding site. Exchanges are allowed to occur alternatively along the axes corresponding to the thermodynamic coupling parameter lambda and the boosting potential, in an extended dual array of coupled lambda- and H-REMD simulations. The method is implemented on the basis of new extensions to the REPDSTR module of the biomolecular simulation program CHARMM. As an illustrative example, the absolute binding free energy of p-xylene to the nonpolar cavity of the L99A mutant of T4 lysozyme was calculated. The tests demonstrate that the dual lambda-REMD and H-REMD simulation scheme greatly accelerates the configurational sampling of the rotameric states of the side chains around the binding pocket, thereby improving the convergence of the FEP computations.},

The model can fully explain recent experimental data, and it predicts cellular volume and pressure for several models of cell cortical mechanics. Moreover, we show that when cells are subjected to an externally applied load, such as in an atomic force microscopy indentation experiment, active regulation of volume and pressure leads to a complex cellular response. Instead of the passive mechanics of the cortex, the observed cell stiffness depends on several factors working together. This provides a mathematical explanation of rate-dependent response of cells under force.},

  abstract = {Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is a unique member of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) protein superfamily. Unlike most other ABC proteins that function as active transporters, CFTR is an ATP-gated chloride channel. The opening of CFTR's gate is associated with ATP-induced dimerization of its two nucleotide-binding domains (NBD1 and NBD2), whereas gate closure is facilitated by ATP hydrolysis-triggered partial separation of the NBDs. This generally held theme of CFTR gating\textemdash a strict coupling between the ATP hydrolysis cycle and the gating cycle\textemdash is put to the test by our recent finding of a short-lived, post-hydrolytic state that can bind ATP and reenter the ATP-induced original open state. We accidentally found a mutant CFTR channel that exhibits two distinct open conductance states, the smaller O1 state and the larger O2 state. In the presence of ATP, the transition between the two states follows a preferred O1\textrightarrow O2 order, a telltale sign of a violation of microscopic reversibility, hence demanding an external energy input likely from ATP hydrolysis, as such preferred gating transition was abolished in a hydrolysis-deficient mutant. Interestingly, we also observed a considerable amount of opening events that contain more than one O1\textrightarrow O2 transition, indicating that more than one ATP molecule may be hydrolyzed within an opening burst. We thus conclude a nonintegral stoichiometry between the gating cycle and ATP consumption. Our results lead to a six-state gating model conforming to the classical allosteric mechanism: both NBDs and transmembrane domains hold a certain degree of autonomy, whereas the conformational change in one domain will facilitate the conformational change in the other domain.},

One of the compounds, Ivacaftor or Kalydeco, which has been approved for clinical use since 2012, acts by promoting the gating function of CFTR. Our recent studies have led to a gating model that features energetic coupling between nucleotide-binding domain (NBD) dimerization and gate opening/closing in CFTR's transmembrane domains (TMDs). Based on this model, we showed that ATP analogs can enhance CFTR gating by facilitating NBD dimerization, whereas Ivacaftor works by stabilizing the open channel conformation of the TMDs. This latter idea also explains the near omnipotence of Ivacaftor. Furthermore, this model identifies multiple approaches to synergistically boost the open probability of CFTR by influencing distinct molecular events that control gating conformational changes.},

Although the epithelium lacks nerves, it is excitable; electrically stimulating the epithelium initiates a propagated action potential. The average resting potential of the epithelial cells is -46 mV. The action potential, recorded with an intracellular electrode, is an all-or-nothing, positive, overshooting spike. The epithelial cells are electrically coupled. The passive electrical properties of the epithelium were determined from the decrement in membrane hyperpolarization with distance from an intracellular, positive current source. The two-dimensional space constant of the epithelium is 1.3 mm, the internal longitudinal resistivity of the cytoplasm and intercellular junctions is 196 omega cm, and the resistivity of both apical and basal cell membranes is greater than 23 k omega cm2. Although the membrane resistivity is high, the transverse resistivity of the epithelium is quite low (7.5 omega cm2), indicating that the epithelium is leaky with a large, transverse, paracellular shunt.},

Through an enormous experimental effort1\textendash 4, the structures of around 100,000 unique proteins have been determined5, but this represents a small fraction of the billions of known protein sequences6,7. Structural coverage is bottlenecked by the months to years of painstaking effort required to determine a single protein structure. Accurate computational approaches are needed to address this gap and to enable large-scale structural bioinformatics. Predicting the three-dimensional structure that a protein will adopt based solely on its amino acid sequence\textemdash the structure prediction component of the `protein folding problem'8\textemdash has been an important open research problem for more than 50~years9. Despite recent progress10\textendash 14, existing methods fall far~short of atomic accuracy, especially when no homologous structure is available. Here we provide the first computational method that can regularly predict protein structures with atomic accuracy even in cases in which no similar structure is known. We validated an entirely redesigned version of our neural network-based model, AlphaFold, in the challenging 14th Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction (CASP14)15, demonstrating accuracy competitive with experimental structures in a majority of cases and greatly outperforming other methods. Underpinning the latest version of AlphaFold is a novel machine learning approach that incorporates physical and biological knowledge about protein structure, leveraging multi-sequence alignments, into the design of the deep learning algorithm.},

  abstract = {Chloride (Cl-) and bicarbonate (HCO3-) are two major anions and their permeation through anion channels plays essential roles in our body. However, the mechanism of ion selection by the anion channels is largely unknown. Here, we provide evidence that pore dilatation increases the bicarbonate permeability (P HC O3/ Cl ) of anion channels by reducing energy barriers of size-exclusion and ion dehydration of HCO3- permeation. Molecular, physiological and computational analyses of major anion channels, such as cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), anoctamin-1(ANO1/TMEM16A) and the glycine receptor (GlyR), revealed that the ion selectivity of anion channels is basically determined by the electric permittivity and diameter of the pore. Importantly, cellular stimuli dynamically modulate the anion selectivity of CFTR and ANO1 by changing the pore size. In addition, pore dilatation by a mutation in the pore-lining region alters the anion selectivity of GlyR. Changes in pore size affected not only the energy barriers of size exclusion but that of ion dehydration by altering the electric permittivity of water-filled cavity in the pore. The dynamic increase in P HC O3/ Cl by pore dilatation may have many physiological and pathophysiological implications ranging from epithelial HCO3- secretion to neuronal excitation.}

To address this, we developed and implemented strategies in the GENESIS molecular dynamics package designed for large numbers of processors. Long-range electrostatic interactions were parallelized by minimizing the number of processes involved in communication. A novel algorithm was implemented for nonbonded interactions to increase single instruction multiple data (SIMD) performance, reducing memory usage for ultra large systems. Memory usage for neighbor searches in real-space nonbonded interactions was reduced by approximately 80\%, leading to significant speedup. Using experimental data describing physical 3D chromatin interactions, we constructed the first atomistic model of an entire gene locus (GATA4). Taken together, these developments enabled the first billion-atom simulation of an intact biomolecular complex, achieving scaling to 65,000 processes (130,000 processor cores) with 1 ns/day performance.

  abstract = {Efficient endocytosis of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is mediated by a tyrosine-based internalization signal in the CFTR carboxyl-terminal tail 1424YDSI1427. In the present studies, two naturally occurring cystic fibrosis mutations in the amino terminus of CFTR, R31C, and R31L were examined. To determine the defect that these mutations cause, the Arg-31 mutants were expressed in COS-7 cells and their biogenesis and trafficking to the cell surface tested in metabolic pulse-chase and surface biotinylation assays, respectively. The results indicated that both Arg-31 mutants were processed to band C at {$\sim$}50\% the efficiency of the wild-type protein. However, once processed and delivered to the cell surface, their half-lives were the same as wildtype protein. Interestingly, indirect immunofluorescence and cell surface biotinylation indicated that the surface pool was much smaller than could be accounted for based on the biogenesis defect alone. Therefore, the Arg-31 mutants were tested in internalization assays and found to be internalized at 2x the rate of the wild-type protein. Patch clamp and 6-methoxy-N-(3-sulfopropyl)quinolinium analysis confirmed reduced amounts of functional Arg-31 channels at the cell surface. Together, the results suggest that both R31C and R31L mutations compromise biogenesis and enhance internalization of CFTR. These two additive effects contribute to the loss of surface expression and the associated defect in chloride conductance that is consistent with a disease phenotype. \textcopyright{} 2006 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.},

  abstract = {The most common mutation in the cystic fibrosis (CF) transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene, Delta F508, results in the production of a misfolded protein that is rapidly degraded. The mutant protein is temperature sensitive, and prior studies indicate that the low-temperature-rescued channel is poorly responsive to physiological stimuli, and is rapidly degraded from the cell surface at 37 degrees C. In the present studies, we tested the effect of a recently characterized pharmacological corrector, 2-(5-chloro-2-methoxy-phenylamino)-4'-methyl-[4,5'bithiazolyl-2'-yl]-phenyl-methanone (corr-4a), on cell surface stability and function of the low-temperature-rescued Delta F508 CFTR. We demonstrate that corr-4a significantly enhanced the protein stability of rescued Delta F508 CFTR for up to 12 hours at 37 degrees C (P {$<$} 0.05). Using firefly luciferase-based reporters to investigate the mechanisms by which low temperature and corr-4a enhance rescue, we found that low-temperature treatment inhibited proteasomal function, whereas corr-4a treatment inhibited the E1-E3 ubiquitination pathway. Ussing chamber studies indicated that corr-4a increased the cAMP-mediated Delta F508 CFTR response by 61\% at 6 hours (P {$<$} 0.05), but not at later time points. However, addition of the CFTR channel activator, 4-methyl-2-(5-phenyl-1H-pyrazol-3-yl)-phenol, significantly augmented cAMP-stimulated currents, revealing that the biochemically detectable cell surface Delta F508 CFTR could be stimulated under the right conditions. Our studies demonstrate that stabilizing rescued Delta F508 CFTR was not sufficient to obtain maximal Delta F508 CFTR function in airway epithelial cells. These results strongly support the idea that maximal correction of Delta F508 CFTR requires a chemical corrector that: (1) promotes folding and exit from the endoplasmic reticulum; (2) enhances surface stability; and (3) improves channel activity.},

A growing number of human disease syndromes are associated with organ failure caused by mutations in telomerase (hTERT or hTR). Mutations in telomerase lead to telomere shortening by decreasing the stability of the telomerase complex, reducing its accumulation, or directly affecting its enzymatic activity. In this work, potential human telomerase mutations were identified by a systematic computational approach. Moreover, molecular docking methods were used to predict the effects of these mutations on the affinity of certain ligands (C\_9i, C\_9k, 16A, and NSC749234). The C\_9k inhibitor had the best binding affinity for wild-type (WT) telomerase. Moreover, C\_9i and C\_9k had improved interactions with human telomerase in most of the mutant models. The R631 and Y717 residues of WT telomerase formed interactions with all studied ligands and these interactions were also commonly found in most of the mutant models. Residues forming stable interactions with ligands in molecular dynamics (MD) were traced, and the MD simulations showed that the C\_9k ligand formed different conformations with WT telomerase than the C\_9i ligand.},

Aggregation was the most common type of problem which was addressed by changing detergents, salt concentration or reconstitution of proteins into nanodiscs or amphipols. We show that the optimal concentration of detergent is between 0.05 and 0.4\% and that the presence of a low concentration of detergent with a high critical micellar concentration protects the proteins from denaturation at the air-water interface. Furthermore, we discuss the strategies for achieving an adequate ice thickness, particle coverage and orientation distribution on free ice and on support films. Our findings provide a clear roadmap for comprehensive screening of conditions for cryo-EM grid preparation of membrane proteins.},

Allosteric modulation by various ligands (               e.g.               , transport substrates, inhibitors, and ATP) has been biochemically shown to directly influence structural dynamics, and thereby, the function of Pgp. However, the molecular details of such effects, particularly with respect to the role and involvement of the surrounding lipids, are not well established. Here, we employ all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to study the conformational landscape of Pgp in the presence of a high-affinity, third-generation inhibitor, tariquidar, in comparison to the nucleotide-free (APO) and the ATP-bound states, in order to characterize the mechanical effects of the inhibitor that might be of relevance to its blocking mechanism of Pgp. Simulations in a multi-component lipid bilayer show a dynamic equilibrium between open(er) and more closed inward-facing (IF) conformations in the APO state, with binding of ATP shifting the equilibrium towards conformations more prone to ATP hydrolysis and subsequent events in the transport cycle. In the presence of the inhibitor bound to the drug-binding pocket within the transmembrane domain (TMD), Pgp samples more open IF conformations, and the nucleotide binding domains (NBDs) become highly dynamic. Interestingly, and reproduced in multiple independent simulations, the inhibitor is observed to facilitate recruitment of lipid molecules into the Pgp lumen through the two proposed drug-entry portals, where the lipid head groups from the cytoplasmic leaflet penetrate into and, in some cases, translocate inside the TMD, while the lipid tails remain extended into the bulk lipid environment. These ``wedge'' lipids likely enhance the inhibitor-induced conformational restriction of the TMD leading to the differential modulation of coupling pathways observed with the NBDs downstream. We suggest a novel inhibitory mechanism for tariquidar, and potentially for related third-generation Pgp inhibitors, where lipids are seen to enhance the inhibitory role in the catalytic cycle of membrane transporters.},

The mechanical stability and line tension of the membrane under these conditions are discussed. The membrane tension due to osmotic pressure and the critical tension of rupture for various membrane compositions are also discussed.

  abstract = {Genetic variants that inactivate protein-coding genes are a powerful source of information about the phenotypic consequences of gene disruption: genes that are crucial for the function of an organism will be depleted of such variants in natural populations, whereas non-essential genes will tolerate their accumulation. However, predicted loss-of-function variants are enriched for annotation errors, and tend to be found at extremely low frequencies, so their analysis requires careful variant annotation and very large sample sizes1. Here we describe the aggregation of 125,748 exomes and 15,708 genomes from human sequencing studies into the Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD). We identify 443,769 high-confidence predicted loss-of-function variants in this cohort after filtering for artefacts caused by sequencing and annotation errors. Using an improved model of human mutation rates, we classify human protein-coding genes along a spectrum that represents tolerance to inactivation, validate this classification using data from model organisms and engineered human cells, and show that it can be used to improve the power of gene discovery for both common and rare diseases.},

  abstract = {Many drugs that target amyloid-{$\beta$} (A{$\beta$}) in Alzheimer disease (AD) have failed to demonstrate clinical efficacy. However, four anti-A{$\beta$} antibodies have been shown to mediate the removal of amyloid plaque from brains of patients with AD, and the FDA has recently granted accelerated approval to one of these, aducanumab, using reduction of amyloid plaque as a surrogate end point. The rationale for approval and the extent of the clinical benefit from these antibodies are under intense debate. With the aim of informing this debate, we review clinical trial data for drugs that target A{$\beta$} from the perspective of the temporal interplay between the two pathognomonic protein aggregates in AD \textemdash{} A{$\beta$} plaques and tau neurofibrillary tangles \textemdash{} and their relationship to cognitive impairment, highlighting differences in drug properties that could affect their clinical performance. On this basis, we propose that A{$\beta$} pathology drives tau pathology, that amyloid plaque would need to be reduced to a low level (\textasciitilde 20 centiloids) to reveal significant clinical benefit and that there will be a lag between the removal of amyloid and the potential to observe a clinical benefit. We conclude that the speed of amyloid removal from the brain by a potential therapy will be important in demonstrating clinical benefit in the context of a clinical trial.},

The simulated X-ray and neutron scattering structure functions (S(q)s) of the DESs made of alkylamide + Li+/ClO4- display two peaks in the intermolecular region of the S(q)s. As a signature of nanoscale structural organization/heterogeneity, a prepeak is observed at 0.1 {$<$} q/\AA -1 {$<$} 0.4. The principal peak observed at around 1.2 {$<$} q/\AA -1 {$<$} 2 is rendered by short-distance inter- and intraspecies correlations. For the DESs studied, we demonstrate that nanoscale spatial heterogeneity is exhibited profoundly by the segregated domains of the constituent electrolyte, and the principal peak in S(q) is because of all sorts of close-contact correlations. The extent of nanoscale morphology as well as the strength of ion pairing is enhanced for the longer-tail alkylamide DES.}

  abstract = {Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common autosomal recessive disorder in Caucasian populations. Individuals with CF have seen significant increases in life expectancy in the last 60 years. As a result, previously rare complications are now coming to light. The most common of these is cystic fibrosis-related diabetes (CFRD), which affects 40-50\% of CF adults. CFRD significantly impacts the pulmonary function and longevity of CF patients, yet a lack of consensus on the best methods to diagnose and treat CFRD remains. We begin by reviewing our understanding of the pathogenesis of CFRD, as emerging evidence shows the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) also has important roles in the release of insulin and glucagon and in the protection of {$\beta$} cells from oxidative stress. We then discuss how current recommended methods of CFRD diagnosis are not appropriate, as continuous glucose monitoring becomes more effective, practical, and cost-effective. Finally, we evaluate emerging treatments which have narrowed the mortality gap within the CF patient group. In the future, pharmacological potentiators and correctors directly targeting CFTR show huge promise for both CFRD and the wider CF patient groups.},

  abstract = {Energy migration between tryptophan residues has been experimentally demonstrated in self-assembled peptide tapes. Each peptide contains 11 amino acids with a Trp at position 6. The peptide self-assembly is pH-sensitive and forms amphiphilic tapes, which further stack in ribbons (double tapes) and fibrils in water depending on the concentration. Fluorescence spectra, quenching, and anisotropy experiments showed that when the pH is lowered from 9 to 2, the peptide self-assembly buries the tryptophan in a hydrophobic and restricted environment in the interior of stable ribbons as expected on the basis of the peptide design. These fluorescence data support directly and for the first time the presence of such ribbons which are characterized by a highly packed and stable hydrophobic interior. In common with Trp in many proteins, fluorescence lifetimes are nonexponential, but the average lifetime is shorter at low pH, possibly due to quenching with neighboring Phe residues. Unexpectedly, time-resolved fluorescence anisotropy does not change significantly with self-assembly when in water. In highly viscous sucrose-water mixtures, the anisotropy decay at low pH was largely unchanged compared to that in water, whereas at high pH, the anisotropy decay increased significantly. We concluded that depolarization at low pH was not due to rotational diffusion but mainly due to energy migration between adjacent tryptophan residues. This was supported by a master equation kinetic model of Trp-Trp energy migration, which showed that the simulated and experimental results are in good agreement, although on average only three Trp residues were visited before emission.},

Upon growth factor stimulation, Akt is phosphorylated at Ser474; however, how this phosphorylation contributes to Akt activation remains controversial. Previous studies, which induced loss of Ser474 phosphorylation by ablating its upstream kinase mTORC2, have implicated Ser474 phosphorylation as a driver of Akt substrate specificity. Here we directly studied the role of Akt2 Ser474 phosphorylation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes by preventing Ser474 phosphorylation without perturbing mTORC2 activity. This was achieved by utilizing a chemical genetics approach, where ectopically expressed S474A Akt2 was engineered with a W80A mutation to confer resistance to the Akt inhibitor MK2206, and thus allow its activation independent of endogenous Akt. We found that insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of four bona fide Akt substrates (TSC2, PRAS40, FOXO1/3a, and AS160) was reduced by {$\sim$}50\% in the absence of Ser474 phosphorylation. Accordingly, insulin-stimulated mTORC1 activation, protein synthesis, FOXO nuclear exclusion, GLUT4 translocation, and glucose uptake were attenuated upon loss of Ser474 phosphorylation. We propose a model where Ser474 phosphorylation is required for maximal Akt2 kinase activity in adipocytes.},

Background: VX-445 is a next-generation cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) corrector designed to restore Phe508del CFTR protein function in patients with cystic fibrosis when administered with tezacaftor and ivacaftor (VX-445-tezacaftor-ivacaftor). Methods: We evaluated the effects of VX-445-tezacaftor-ivacaftor on Phe508del CFTR protein processing, trafficking, and chloride transport in human bronchial epithelial cells. On the basis of in vitro activity, a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, dose-ranging, phase 2 trial was conducted to evaluate oral VX-445-tezacaftor-ivacaftor in patients heterozygous for the Phe508del CFTR mutation and a minimal-function mutation (Phe508del- MF) and in patients homozygous for the Phe508del CFTR mutation (Phe508del-Phe508del) after tezacaftor-ivacaftor run-in. Primary end points were safety and absolute change in percentage of predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) from baseline. Results: In vitro, VX-445-tezacaftor-ivacaftor significantly improved Phe508del CFTR protein processing, trafficking, and chloride transport to a greater extent than any two of these agents in dual combination. In patients with cystic fibrosis, VX-445-tezacaftor-ivacaftor had an acceptable safety and side-effect profile. Most adverse events were mild or moderate. The treatment also resulted in an increased percentage of predicted FEV1 of up to 13.8 points in the Phe508del-MF group (P{$<$}0.001). In patients in the Phe508del-Phe508del group, who were already receiving tezacaftor-ivacaftor, the addition of VX-445 resulted in an 11.0-point increase in the percentage of predicted FEV1 (P{$<$}0.001). In both groups, there was a decrease in sweat chloride concentrations and improvement in the respiratory domain score on the Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire-Revised. Conclusions: The use of VX-445-tezacaftor-ivacaftor to target Phe508del CFTR protein resulted in increased CFTR function in vitro and translated to improvements in patients with cystic fibrosis with one or two Phe508del alleles. This approach has the potential to treat the underlying cause of cystic fibrosis in approximately 90\% of patients.},

For some, however, these therapies remain inaccessible due to the rarity of their individual CFTR variants, or due to a lack of biologic activity of the available therapies for certain variants. One proposed method of addressing this gap is the use of primary human cell-based models, which allow preclinical therapeutic testing and physiologic assessment of relevant tissue at the individual level. Nasal cells represent one such tissue source and have emerged as a powerful model for individual disease study. The ex vivo culture of nasal cells has evolved over time, and modern nasal cell models are beginning to be utilized to predict patient outcomes. This review will discuss both historical and current state-of-the art use of nasal cells for study in CF, with a particular focus on the use of such models to inform personalized patient care.},

Monte Carlo calculations have been used in an attempt to find the solvated system X -(H 2O) n (X = F, Cl) with the lowest energy for each value of n. It is predicted that 18 water molecules are required to form a complete solvation shell around a Cl - anion, where "complete solvation" is interpreted as an ion that is completely surrounded by solvent molecules. Although fewer water molecules may fully solvate the Cl - anion, such structures are higher in energy than partially solvated molecules, up to n {$\geq$} 18. Calculations on the F - anion suggest that 15 water molecules are required for a complete solvation shell.

The primary endpoint was absolute change in lung clearance index2.5 from baseline through Week 8. Additional endpoints included lung function, patient-reported outcomes, and in vitro intestinal organoid-based measurements of ivacaftor-induced cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator function.Results: Of 38 participants, 37 completed the study. The primary endpoint was met; the Bayesian posterior probability of improvement in lung clearance index2.5 with ivacaftor versus placebo was {$>$}99\%. Additional endpoints improved with ivacaftor. Safety findings were consistent with ivacaftor's known safety profile. Dose-dependent swelling was observed in 23 of 25 viable organoid cultures with ivacaftor treatment.

The characteristics of these molecules that are of key interest are their selectivity and high potency against several MDR etiological agents. Objective Although many studies have been published about carboxyl polyether antibiotics, there are no recent reviews of this class of drugs. The purpose of this review is to provide the reader with an overview of the spectrum of activity of polyether antibiotics, their mechanism of action, toxicity and potential as drug candidates to combat drug-resistant infectious diseases. Conclusion Polyether ionophores show a high degree of promise for the potential control of drug-resistant bacterial and parasitic infections. Despite the long history of use of this class of drugs, very limited medicinal chemistry and drug optimization studies have been reported, thus leaving the door open to these opportunities in the future. Scifinder and PubMed were the main search engines used to locate articles relevant to the topic presented in the present review. Keywords used in our search were specific names of each of the 88 compounds presented in the review as well as more general terms such as polyethers, ionophores, carboxylic polyethers and polyether antibiotics.},

Accurately assessing absolute binding free energies, although highly desired, remains a challenging endeavour, mostly limited to small model cases. Here, we demonstrate accurate first principles based absolute binding free energy estimates for 128 pharmaceutically relevant targets. We use a novel rigorous method to generate protein\textendash ligand ensembles for the ligand in its decoupled state. Not only do the calculations deliver accurate protein\textendash ligand binding affinity estimates, but they also provide detailed physical insight into the structural determinants of binding. We identify subtle rotamer rearrangements between apo and holo states of a protein that are crucial for binding. When compared to relative binding free energy calculations, obtaining absolute binding free energies is considerably more challenging in large part due to the need to explicitly account for the protein in its apo state. In this work we present several approaches to obtain apo state ensembles for accurate absolute {$\Delta$}G calculations, thus outlining protocols for prospective application of the methods for drug discovery., Molecular dynamics based absolute protein\textendash ligand binding free energies can be calculated accurately and at large scale to facilitate drug discovery.},

Methods: We measured effects of CFTR modulators on CFTR-dependent sweating (`C-sweat') in two pancreatic sufficient cystic fibrosis (CF) subjects. S1 (S945L/G542X) took ivacaftor and S2 (S945L/F508del) took ivacaftor + tezacaftor. Sweating was stimulated pharmacologically to produce sequentially both CFTR-independent (methacholine stimulated) M-sweat and C-sweat; and the ratio of these was compared. Sweat secretion was measured with two methods: real time secretory rate quantitative recording and by optically measuring the growth of sweat bubbles under oil from multiple identified glands. Results: Using the quantitative recorder, we saw zero C-sweat secretion off-drug, but when on-drug the C-sweat responses for both subjects were comparable to those seen in carriers. The on-drug response was further quantified using the sweat bubble method. Each subject again showed robust C-sweat responses, with C-sweat/M-sweat ratios \textasciitilde{} half of the ratio determined for a cohort of 40 controls tested under identical conditions. Conclusion: These in vivo results, consistent with prior in vitro findings, indicate that the drug treatments restore near-normal function to S945L-CFTR, and support the use of ivacaftor as a treatment for CF patients who carry this allele.},

Dynamically regulated ion channel activity and anion selectivity of CFTR by kinases sensitive to intracellular chloride concentration ([Cl-]i) play an important role in epithelial HCO3- secretion. However, the molecular mechanisms of how [Cl-]i-dependent mechanisms regulate CFTR are unknown. Methods We examined the mechanisms of the CFTR HCO3- channel regulation by [Cl-]i-sensitive kinases using an integrated electrophysiological, molecular, and computational approach including whole-cell, outside-out, and inside-out patch clamp recordings and molecular dissection of WNK1 and CFTR proteins. In addition, we analyzed the effects of pancreatitis-causing CFTR mutations on the WNK1-mediated regulation of CFTR. Results Among the WNK1, SPAK, and OSR1 kinases that constitute a [Cl-]i-sensitive kinase cascade, the expression of WNK1 alone was sufficient to increase the CFTR bicarbonate permeability (PHCO3/PCl) and conductance (GHCO3) in patch clamp recordings. Molecular dissection of the WNK1 domains revealed that the WNK1 kinase domain is responsible for CFTR PHCO3/PCl regulation by direct association with CFTR, while the surrounding N-terminal regions mediate the [Cl-]i-sensitivity of WNK1. Furthermore, the pancreatitis-causing R74Q and R75Q mutations in the elbow helix 1 of CFTR hampered WNK1-CFTR physical associations and reduced WNK1-mediated CFTR PHCO3/PCl regulation. Conclusion The CFTR HCO3- channel activity is regulated by [Cl-]i and a WNK1-dependent mechanism. Our results provide new insights into the regulation of the ion selectivity of CFTR and the pathogenesis of CFTR-related disorders.},

  abstract = {Bicarbonate facilitates mucin unpacking and bacterial killing; however, its transport mechanisms in the airways are not well understood. cAMP stimulates anion efflux through the cystic fibrosis (CF) transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR; ABCC7) anion channel, and this is defective in CF. The anion exchanger pendrin (SLC26A4) also mediates HCO3- efflux and is upregulated by proinflammatory cytokines. Here, we examined pendrin and CFTR expression and their contributions to HCO3- secretion by human nasal and bronchial epithelia. In native tissue, both proteins were most abundant at the apical pole of ciliated surface cells with little expression in submucosal glands. In well-differentiated primary nasal and bronchial cell cultures, IL-4 dramatically increased pendrin mRNA levels and apical immunostaining. Exposure to low-Cl- apical solution caused intracellular alkalinization ({$\Delta$}pHi) that was enhanced fourfold by IL-4 pretreatment. {$\Delta$}pHi was unaffected by 4,4'-diisothiocyano-2,2'-stilbenedisulfonic acid (DIDS) or CFTR inhibitor CFTRinh-172, but was reduced by adenoviral shRNA targeting pendrin. Forskolin increased {$\Delta$}pHi, and this stimulation was prevented by CFTRinh-172, implicating CFTR, yet forskolin only increased {$\Delta$}pHi after pendrin expression had been induced by IL-4. The dependence of {$\Delta$}pHi on pendrin suggests there is minimal electrical coupling between Cl- and HCO3- fluxes and that CFTR activation increases anion exchange-mediated HCO3- influx. Conversely, inducing pendrin expression increased forskolin-stimulated, CFTRinh-172-sensitive current by approximately twofold in epithelial and nonepithelial cells. We conclude that pendrin mediates most HCO3- secretion across airway surface epithelium during inflammation and enhances electrogenic Cl- secretion via CFTR, as described for other SLC26A transporters.},

This is not yet the case for solution spectra. To contribute to the exploration of corresponding computational procedures, here we suggest a more efficient variant of the so-called instantaneous normal-mode analysis (INMA). This variant applies conventional molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, which are based on nonpolarizable molecular mechanics (MM) force fields, to the rapid generation of a large ensemble of different solvation shells for a solute molecule. Short hybrid simulations, in which the solute is treated by DFT and the aqueous solvent by MM, start from snapshots of the MM solute-solvent MD trajectory and yield a set of statistically independent hydration shells partially adjusted to the DFT/MM force field. Within INMA, these shells are kept fixed at their 300 K structures, line spectra are calculated from the DFT/MM Hessians of the solute, and its inhomogeneously broadened solution spectra are derived by second-order statistics. As our test application we have selected the phosphate ions HPO42- and H2PO4 because sizable solvation effects are expected for the IR spectra of these strongly polarizable ions. The widths, intensities, and spectral positions of the calculated bands are compared with experimental IR spectra recorded by us for the purpose of checking the computational procedures. These comparisons provide insights into the merits and limitations of the available DFT/MM approach to the prediction of IR spectra in the condensed phase.}

We propose an explanation, based on molecular simulations, how ions determine the miscibility of ILs and suggest a straightforward and computationally inexpensive method to predict the miscibility of arbitrary new ILs. The influence of ions on the solvation of water is analyzed by comparing molecular dynamics simulations of water in 9 different ILs with varying cation and anion constituents. The solvation of water in ILs is found to depend primarily on the electrostatic water-ion interaction strength, which, in turn, is determined mainly by two factors: primarily, by the size of the ions and secondarily by the amount of charge on the ion surface that is coordinated with water. It is demonstrated that large ions lead to weaker interactions with water, due to the involved delocalization of the ion charge. A large charge on the ion surface, which is determined by the chemical structure of the ion, strengthens water-ion interactions. We observe that whenever the interaction strength of water with ions exceeds a certain threshold, an IL becomes water-miscible. On the basis of these findings, a simple equation is derived that estimates the water-ion interaction strength. With this equation it is possible to predict most of the observed water-miscibilities of a sample of 83 ILs correctly. A linear increase of the water saturation concentration with the estimated water-ion interaction strength is observed in waterimmiscible ILs, which can be utilized to predict the water concentration in new ILs. \textcopyright{} 2010 American Chemical Society.}

The method and cutoff (rc) dependences of surface tensions, density profiles, water dipole orientation, and electrostatic potential profiles are used as metrics. The water/vapor, heptane/vapor, and hexadecane/vapor interfaces are accurately and efficiently calculated with 2D IPS (rc = 10 \AA ). It is demonstrated that 3D IPS is not practical for any of the interfacial systems studied. However, the hybrid method PME/IPS [Particle Mesh Ewald for electrostatics and 3D IPS for Lennard-Jones (LJ) interactions] provides an efficient way to include both types of long-range forces in simulations of large liquid/vacuum and all liquid/liquid interfaces, including lipid monolayers and bilayers. A previously published pressure-based long-range LJ correction yields results similar to those of PME/IPS for liquid/liquid interfaces. The contributions to surface tension of LJ terms arising from interactions beyond 10 \AA{} range from 13 dyn/cm for the hexadecane/vapor interface to approximately 3 dyn/cm for hexadecane/water and DPPC bilayers and monolayers. Surface tensions of alkane/vapor, hexadecane/water, and DPPC monolayers based on the CHARMM lipid force fields agree very well with experiment, whereas surface tensions of the TIP3P and TIP4P-Ew water models underestimate experiment by 16 and 11 dyn/cm, respectively.

QM calculations ranging from high-level ab initio calculations on small molecules to semiempirical QM studies on a 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-phosphatidylcholine (DPPC) bilayer in combination with experimental thermodynamic data were used as target data for parameter optimization. These changes were tested with simulations of pure bilayers at high hydration of the following six lipids: DPPC, 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn- phosphatidylcholine (DMPC), 1,2-dilauroyl-sn-phosphatidylcholine (DLPC), 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-phosphatidylcholine (POPC), 1,2-dioleoyl-sn- phosphatidylcholine (DOPC), and 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-phosphatidylethanolamine (POPE); simulations of a low hydration DOPC bilayer were also performed. Agreement with experimental surface area is on average within 2\%, and the density profiles agree well with neutron and X-ray diffraction experiments. NMR deuterium order parameters (SCD) are well predicted with the new FF, including proper splitting of the SCD for the aliphatic carbon adjacent to the carbonyl for DPPC, POPE, and POPC bilayers. The area compressibility modulus and frequency dependence of 13C NMR relaxation rates of DPPC and the water distribution of low hydration DOPC bilayers also agree well with experiment. Accordingly, the presented lipid FF, referred to as C36, allows for molecular dynamics simulations to be run in the tensionless ensemble (NPT), and is anticipated to be of utility for simulations of pure lipid systems as well as heterogeneous systems including membrane proteins. \textcopyright{} 2010 American Chemical Society.},

  abstract = {ABC transporters transport a wealth of molecules across membranes and consist of transmembrane and cytosolic domains. Their activity cycle involves a tightly regulated and concerted domain choreography. Regulation is driven by the cytosolic domains and function by the transmembrane domains. Folding of these polytopic multidomain proteins to their functional state is a challenge for cells, which is mitigated by co-translational and sequential events. We here reveal the first stages of co-translational domain folding and assembly of CFTR, the ABC transporter defective in the most abundant rare inherited disease cystic fibrosis. We have combined biosynthetic radiolabeling with protease-susceptibility assays and domain-specific antibodies. The most N-terminal domain, TMD1 (transmembrane domain 1), folds both its hydrophobic and soluble helices during translation: the transmembrane helices pack tightly and the cytosolic N- and C-termini assemble with the first cytosolic helical loop ICL1, leaving only ICL2 exposed. This N-C-ICL1 assembly is strengthened by two independent events: (i) assembly of ICL1 with the N-terminal subdomain of the next domain, cytosolic NBD1 (nucleotide-binding domain 1); and (ii) in the presence of corrector drug VX-809, which rescues cell-surface expression of a range of disease-causing CFTR mutants. Both lead to increased shielding of the CFTR N-terminus, and their additivity implies different modes of action. Early assembly of NBD1 and TMD1 is essential for CFTR folding and positions both domains for the required assembly with TMD2. Altogether, we have gained insights into this first, nucleating, VX-809-enhanced domain-assembly event during and immediately after CFTR translation, involving structures conserved in type-I ABC exporters.},

  abstract = {Molecular simulations are a computational technique used to investigate the dynamics of proteins and other molecules. The free energy landscape of these simulations is often rugged, and minor differences in the initial velocities, floating-point precision, or underlying hardware can cause identical simulations (replicas) to take different paths in the landscape. In this study we investigated the magnitude of these effects based on 310\,000 ns of simulation time. We performed 100 identically parametrized replicas of 3000 ns each for a small 10 amino acid system as well as 100 identically parametrized replicas of 100 ns each for an 827 residue T-cell receptor/MHC system. Comparing randomly chosen subgroups within these replica sets, we estimated the reproducibility and reliability that can be achieved by a given number of replicas at a given simulation time. These results demonstrate that conclusions drawn from single simulations are often not reproducible and that conclusions drawn from multiple shorter replicas are more reliable than those from a single longer simulation. The actual number of replicas needed will always depend on the question asked and the level of reliability sought. On the basis of our data, it appears that a good rule of thumb is to perform a minimum of five to 10 replicas.},

Based on molecular dynamics studies it is widely believed that Na+ ions specifically bind to 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC) membranes, whereas Cl- ions stay in solution. Here, we present a careful comparison of recent data from electrophoresis and isothermal titration calorimetry experiments as well as molecular dynamics simulations suggesting that in fact both ions show very similar affinities. The corresponding binding constants are 0.44({$\pm$}0.05) M-1 for Na+ and 0.40({$\pm$}0.04) M-1 for Cl- ions. This is highlighted by our observation that a widely used simulation setup showing asymmetric affinities of Na + and Cl- for POPC bilayers overestimates the effect of NaCl on the electrophoretic mobility of a POPC membrane by an order of magnitude. Implications for previous simulation results on the effect of NaCl on polarization of interfacial water, transmembrane potentials, and mechanisms for ion transport through bilayers are discussed. Our findings suggest that a range of published simulations results on the interaction of NaCl with phosphocholine bilayers have to be reconsidered and revised and that force field refinements are necessary for reliable simulation studies of membranes at physiological conditions on a molecular level. \textcopyright{} 2013 Biophysical Society.},

  abstract = {Some scientists believe that although evolutionary theory is explanatory, it does not have, in contrast to the theories of physics, any predictive power. This raises the question of its testability. The analysis given shows that there are good reasons to claim the unpredictability of evolutionary events; nevertheless, the evolutionary theory               has               potential predictive power. It is argued that the difference between biology and physics lies not in the predictive power of the theories involved, but in the different weight which is lent to the forecasting of particular events in these sciences. A second source of confusion derives from the ambiguity of the term `prediction'. In order to define `prediction' for cases in which the term is used to refer to a part of testing procedure, the reference to the time-point ``now'' is quite irrelevant. Prediction of unknown observational data is sufficient for testing a hypothesis, but such prediction may or may not be identical with forecasting of               future               events. Different factors that may cause particular difficulties met by biologists in forecasting future events are analyzed subsequently in the second part of the paper. The conclusion is drawn that although particular cognitive situations limiting the ability of forecasting are very frequent in biological sciences, the claim about the peculiar logical status of biological theories is not thereby justified.},

To define the mechanism underlying CFTR-associated GSH flux, we studied wild-type and mutant CFTR proteins expressed in Sf9 membranes, as well as purified and reconstituted CFTR. We show that CFTR-expressing membrane vesicles mediate nucleotide-activated GSH flux, which is disrupted in the R347D pore mutant, and in the Walker A K464A and K1250A mutants. Further, we reveal that purified CFTR protein alone directly mediates nucleotide-dependent GSH flux. Interestingly, although ATP supports GSH flux through CFTR, this activity is enhanced in the presence of the non-hydrolyzable ATP analog AMP-PNP. These findings corroborate previous suggestions that CFTR pore properties can vary with the nature of the nucleotide interaction. In conclusion, our data demonstrate that GSH flux is an intrinsic function of CFTR and prompt future examination of the role of this function in airway biology in health and disease.},

This technique measures the number density, diffusion coefficient, and velocity of fluorescently labeled macromolecules in a cell membrane imaged on a confocal, two-photon, or total internal reflection fluorescence microscope. In contrast to r-space correlation techniques, we show kICS can recover accurate dynamics even in the presence of complex fluorophore photobleaching and/or "blinking". Furthermore, these quantities can be calculated without nonlinear curve fitting, or any knowledge of the beam radius of the exciting laser. The number densities calculated by kICS are less sensitive to spatial inhomogeneity of the fluorophore distribution than densities measured using image correlation spectroscopy. We use simulations as a proof-of-principle to show that number densities and transport coefficients can be extracted using this technique. We present calibration measurements with fluorescent microspheres imaged on a confocal microscope, which recover Stokes-Einstein diffusion coefficients, and flow velocities that agree with single particle tracking measurements. We also show the application of kICS to measurements of the transport dynamics of {$\alpha$}5-integrin/enhanced green fluorescent protein constructs in a transfected CHO cell imaged on a total internal reflection fluorescence microscope using charge-coupled device area detection. \textcopyright{} 2006 by the Biophysical Society.}

It is a key component of bacterial cell wall peptidoglycan, fungal cell wall chitin, and the extracellular matrix of animal cells. Interestingly, recent studies have also identified new roles for GlcNAc in cell signaling. For example, GlcNAc stimulates the human fungal pathogen Candida albicans to undergo changes in morphogenesis and expression of virulence genes. Pathogenic E. coli responds to GlcNAc by altering the expression of fimbriae and CURLI fibers that promote biofilm formation and GlcNAc stimulates soil bacteria to undergo changes in morphogenesis and production of antibiotics. Studies with animal cells have revealed that GlcNAc influences cell signaling through the posttranslational modification of proteins by glycosylation. O-linked attachment of GlcNAc to Ser and Thr residues regulates a variety of intracellular proteins, including transcription factors such as NF {$\kappa$} B, c-myc, and p53. In addition, the specificity of Notch family receptors for different ligands is altered by GlcNAc attachment to fucose residues in the extracellular domain. GlcNAc also impacts signal transduction by altering the degree of branching of N-linked glycans, which influences cell surface signaling proteins. These emerging roles of GlcNAc as an activator and mediator of cellular signaling in fungi, animals, and bacteria will be the focus of this paper.}

Five arguments in sup- port of greater international cooperation and more formal processes of global governance on international migration are presented here. First, contemporary international migration is now occurring at unprecedented levels and has a truly global reach. Second, international migration can no longer effectively bemanaged or controlled by nationalmigration policies, and greater international cooperation is required to achieve national goals in international migration. Third, there are growing numbers of migrants around the world who are vulnerable and exploited, and insufficiently pro- tected by either states or international institutions. Fourth, emerging struc- tural features in the global economy, alongside the effects of climate change, are likely to significantly increase the scale of internationalmigrationworld- wide, and present new management and protection challenges. Finally, mo- mentumfor change is slowly developing. KEYWORDS: internationalmigration, global governance.},

Addition of Lumacaftor reverses the aberrant opening of the mutant hairpin to restore a compact state as in the wild type. The observed membrane escape of the V232D hairpin and its reversal by Lumacaftor complement cell-based analyses of the full-length protein, thereby providing in vivo and in vitro correlates of CFTR misfolding and drug-action mechanisms.},

  abstract = {We have developed a simple and quantitative explanation for the relatively low melting temperatures of ionic liquids (ILs). The basic concept was to assess the Gibbs free energy of fusion ({$\Delta$}fusG) for the process IL(S) \textrightarrow{} IL(l), which relates to the melting point of the IL. This was done using a suitable Born-Fajans-Haber cycle that was closed by the lattice (i.e., IL(S) \textrightarrow{} IL(g)) Gibbs energy and the solvation (i.e., IL(g) \textrightarrow{} IL(l)) Gibbs energies of the constituent ions in the molten salt. As part of this project we synthesized and determined accurate melting points (by DSC) and dielectric constants (by dielectric spectroscopy) for 14 ionic liquids based on four common anions and nine common cations. Lattice free energies ({$\Delta$}lattG) were estimated using a combination of Volume Based Thermodynamics (VBT) and quantum chemical calculations. Free energies of solvation ({$\Delta$} SOlVG) of each ion in the bulk molten salt were calculated using the COSMO solvation model and the experimental dielectric constants. Under standard ambient conditions (298.15 K and 10s Pa) {$\Delta$}fusG\textdegree{} was found to be negative for all the ILs studied, as expected for liquid samples. Thus, these ILs are liquid under standard ambient conditions because the liquid state is thermodynamically favorable, due to the large size and conformational flexibility of the ions involved, which leads to small lattice enthalpies and large entropy changes that favor melting. This model can be used to predict the melting temperatures and dielectric constants of ILs with good accuracy. A comparison of the predicted vs experimental melting points for nine of the ILs (excluding those where no melting transition was observed and two outliers that were not well described by the model) gave a standard error of the estimate (sest) of 8 \textdegree C. A similar comparison for dielectric constant predictions gave sest as 2.5 units. Thus, from very little experimental and computational data it is possible to predict fundamental properties such as melting points and dielectric constants of ionic liquids. \textcopyright{} 2006 American Chemical Society.}

  abstract = {Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disorder that causes multiorgan morbidity and premature death, most commonly from pulmonary dysfunction. Mutations in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene, of which almost 2000 have been described, result in a dysfunctional CFTR protein. This protein is an adenosine triphosphate binding anion channel, present primarily at the surface of epithelial cells. Loss of function mutations in this anion channel result in decreased or absent chloride/bicarbonate transport. The subsequent abnormal salt and water transport at epithelial cell surfaces leads to thickened secretions, and infection or inflammation in affected organs. In the last 20 years, therapeutics have been developed to treat the signs and symptoms of CF. However, in 2012, the small molecule drug, ivacaftor, became the first approved therapy that addresses the basic defect in CF. Ivacaftor is a potentiator of CFTR channels defective in their chloride/bicarbonate gating/conductance, but present at the epithelial cell surface. It is only approved for 10 mutations carried by approximately 7\% of the population of patients with CF. F508del is the most common CFTR mutation, present in homozygosity in approximately 50\% of patients with CF. The F508del mutation results in multiple CFTR channel defects that require both correction (stabilization of misfolded CFTR and trafficking to the epithelial cell membrane) and potentiation. This article reviews the in vitro and clinical trial data for the potential use of the potentiator, ivacaftor, and the corrector, lumacaftor, in patients with CF. \textcopyright{} 2015, SAGE Publications.

Furthermore, molecular docking results show that the imidazolium-cation of the IL enters the sub-domains of CT and interacts with the ionic residues of CT, that is, Ser217 close to Trp215. This interaction is in well agreement with the fluorescence quenching observed for CT in the presence of [Bmim]\textbackslash textlesssup\textbackslash textgreater+\textbackslash textless/sup\textbackslash textgreater. On the other hand, the destabilizing anion such as SO\textbackslash textlessinf\textbackslash textgreater4\textbackslash textless/inf\textbackslash textgreater\textbackslash textlesssup\textbackslash textgreater2-\textbackslash textless/sup\textbackslash textgreater was observed to be directly interacting with Ser195 in the active site of CT. We have observed that the Hofmeister series effects of anions of either Is or ILs are entirely based on the interaction of the anions with their counterions, that is, cations, with solvent molecules, as well as with the protein surface. Evidently, these interactions vary with the co-solvent system and the type of protein. Hence, the stability of a biomolecule in the presence of the anions may or may not obey the Hofmeister series.}

This activity generates action potentials in nerves, muscles and other excitable cells, and forms the basis of all movement, sensation and thought processes in living beings. While the functional properties of ion channels are well known from physiological studies, lack of structural knowledge has hindered development of realistic theoretical models necessary for understanding and interpretation of these properties. Recent determination of the molecular structures of potassium and mechanosensitive channels from x-ray crystallography has finally broken this impasse, heralding a new age in ion channel studies where study of structure\textendash function relationships takes a central stage. In this paper, we present a critical review of various approaches to modelling of ion transport in membrane channels, including continuum theories, Brownian dynamics, and classical and ab initio molecular dynamics. Strengths and weaknesses of each approach are discussed and illustrated with applications to some specific ion channels.},

Here, we use thermal titration methods and cryo-EM in an attempt to obtain temporal resolution of the conformational trajectory of the vanilloid receptor TRPV1 with resiniferatoxin (RTx) bound. Based on our cryo-EM ensemble analysis, RTx binding to TRPV1 appears to induce intracellular gate opening first, followed by selectivity filter dilation, then pore loop rearrangement to reach the final open state. This apparent conformational wave likely arises from the concerted, stepwise, additive structural changes of TRPV1 over many subdomains. Greater understanding of the RTx-mediated long-range allostery of TRPV1 could help further the therapeutic potential of RTx, which is a promising drug candidate for pain relief associated with advanced cancer or knee arthritis.},

This long-range correction (LRC) consists of an additional applied pressure tensor which is periodically calculated from the difference of instantaneous pressures at the selected cutoff and a very long cutoff. It provides results that are nearly independent of the LJ cutoff distance at negligible additional calculation costs, and is particularly suited for anisotropic systems such as liquid/liquid interfaces or heterogeneous macromolecules where approximations based on spherically symmetric radial distribution functions are expected to fail. The utility of the method is demonstrated for a series of alkanes and water, and for interfaces including a lipid bilayer. The LRC increases densities and decreases isothermal compressibilities, with the changes larger for alkanes than for water (where the long-range interactions are dominated by electrostatic interactions). While implementation of the LRC will not necessarily improve agreement with a particular experiment, it will provide a baseline for improvements in a parameter set that are consistent with the long-range Lennard-Jones interactions.},

Cell proliferation must--at some time point--increase cell volume and apoptosis is typically paralleled by cell shrinkage. Cell volume changes require the participation of ion transport across the cell membrane, including appropriate activity of Cl- and K+ channels. Besides regulating cytosolic Cl- activity, osmolyte flux and, thus, cell volume, most Cl- channels allow HCO3- exit and cytosolic acidification, which inhibits cell proliferation and favors apoptosis. K+ exit through K+ channels may decrease intracellular K+ concentration, which in turn favors apoptotic cell death. K+ channel activity further maintains the cell membrane potential, a critical determinant of Ca2+ entry through Ca2+ channels. Cytosolic Ca2+ may trigger mechanisms required for cell proliferation and stimulate enzymes executing apoptosis. The switch between cell proliferation and apoptosis apparently depends on the magnitude and temporal organization of Ca2+ entry and on the functional state of the cell. Due to complex interaction with other signaling pathways, a given ion channel may play a dual role in both cell proliferation and apoptosis. Thus, specific ion channel blockers may abrogate both fundamental cellular mechanisms, depending on cell type, regulatory environment and condition of the cell. Clearly, considerable further experimental effort is required to fully understand the complex interplay between ion channels, cell proliferation and apoptosis.},

Principal component analysis (PCA) is a widely used method to extract functionally relevant collective motions from a molecular dynamics (MD) trajectory. Being based on the covariance matrix, however, PCA detects only linear correlations. Here we present a new method, full correlation analysis (FCA), which is based on mutual information and thus quantifies all correlations, including nonlinear and higher order correlations. For comparison, we applied both, PCA and FCA, to {$\sim$}100 ns MD trajectories of T4 lysozyme and the hexapeptide neurotensin. For both systems, FCA yielded better resolved conformational substates and aligned its modes more often with actual transition pathways. This improved resolution is shown to be due to a strongly increased anharmonicity of FCA modes as compared to the respective PCA modes. The high anharmonicity further suggests that the motions extracted by FCA are functionally more relevant than those captured by PCA. In summary, FCA should provide improved collective degrees of freedom for dimension-reduced descriptions of macromolecular dynamics. \textcopyright{} 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

  abstract = {F508del-cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is the major mutant responsible for cystic fibrosis (CF). ORKAMBI\textregistered, approved for patients bearing this mutant, contains lumacaftor (VX-809) that partially corrects F508del-CFTR's processing defect and ivacaftor (VX-770) that potentiates its defective channel activity. Unfortunately, the clinical efficacy of ORKAMBI\textregistered{} is modest, highlighting the need to understand how the small molecules work so that superior compounds can be developed. Because, human CFTR (hCFTR) and zebrafish Cftr (zCftr) are structurally conserved as determined in recent cryo-EM structural models, we hypothesized that the consequences of the major mutation and small molecule modulators would be similar for the two species of protein. As expected, like the F508del mutation in hCFTR, the homologous mutation in zCftr (F507del) is misprocessed, yet not as severely as the human mutant and this defect was restored by low-temperature (27\textdegree C) culture conditions. After rescue to the cell surface, F507del-zCftr exhibited regulated channel activity that was potentiated by ivacaftor. Surprisingly, lumacaftor failed to rescue misprocessing of the F507del-zCftr at either 37 or 27\textdegree C suggesting that future comparative studies with F508del-hCFTR would provide insight into its structure: function relationships. Interestingly, the robust rescue of F508del-zCftr at 27\textdegree C and availability of methods for in vivo screening in zebrafish present the opportunity to define the cellular pathways underlying rescue.},

Encouraged by this correlation, we were prompted to evaluate the effect of the elexacaftor, tezacaftor and ivacaftor triple combination on primary nasal epithelial cultures obtained from individuals with rare class II CF-causing mutations (G85E, M1101K and N1303K) for which Trikafta is not approved. Cultures from individuals homozygous for M1101K responded better than cultures harbouring G85E and N1303K after treatment with the triple combination with respect to improvement in regulated channel function and protein processing. A similar genotype-specific effect of the triple combination was observed when the different mutations were expressed in HEK293 cells, supporting the hypothesis that these modulators may act directly on the mutant proteins. Detailed studies in nasal cultures and HEK293 cells showed that the corrector, elexacaftor, exhibited dual activity as both corrector and potentiator, and suggested that the potentiator activity contributes to its pharmacological activity. These pre-clinical studies using nasal epithelial cultures identified mutation genotypes for which elexacaftor, tezacaftor and ivacaftor may produce clinical responses that are comparable to, or inferior to, those observed for F508del-CFTR.},

While opening of TMEM16A requires binding of intracellular Ca2+, prolonged Ca2+-dependent activation results in channel desensitization or rundown, the mechanism of which is unclear. Here we show that phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate (PIP2) regulates TMEM16A channel activation and desensitization via binding to a putative binding site at the cytosolic interface of transmembrane segments (TMs) 3\textendash 5. We further demonstrate that the ion-conducting pore of TMEM16A is constituted of two functionally distinct modules: a Ca2+-binding module formed by TMs 6\textendash 8 and a PIP2-binding regulatory module formed by TMs 3\textendash 5, which mediate channel activation and desensitization, respectively. PIP2 dissociation from the regulatory module results in ion-conducting pore collapse and subsequent channel desensitization. Our findings thus provide key insights into the mechanistic understanding of TMEM16 channel gating and lipid-dependent regulation.},

Thus, CFTR is controlled by elaborate positive and negative regulations for an efficient homeostasis. It has been shown that expression and activity of CFTR can be regulated either positively or negatively by PDZ (PSD-95/discs large/ZO-1) domain-based adaptors. Although a positive regulation by PDZ domain-based adaptors such as EBP50/NHERF1 is established, the mechanisms for negative regulation of the CFTR by Shank2, as well as the effects of multiple adaptor interactions, are not known. Here we demonstrate a physical and physiological competition between EBP50-CFTR and Shank2-CFTR associations and the dynamic regulation of CFTR activity by these positive and negative interactions using the surface plasmon resonance assays and consecutive patch clamp experiments. Furthermore whereas EBP50 recruits a cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) complex to CFTR, Shank2 was found to be physically and functionally associated with the cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase PDE4D that precludes cAMP/PKA signals in epithelial cells and mouse brains. These findings strongly suggest that balanced interactions between the membrane transporter and multiple PDZ-based adaptors play a critical role in the homeostatic regulation of epithelial transport and possibly the membrane transport in other tissues.},

In particular, A{$\beta$}42 shows relatively high toxicity among the different A{$\beta$} isoforms, and its toxicity is thought to be because of its structural features. Recent ssNMR and cryo-EM experiments identified that A{$\beta$}42 shows an S-shaped triple-{$\beta$} structure, in contrast to the previously suggested U-shaped {$\beta$}-arch structure. In order to associate the high toxicity of A{$\beta$}42 with its structural features, it is essential to explain the conformational stability and aggregation mechanisms of this triple-{$\beta$} motif. We utilized several different simulation methods, including extensive straight molecular dynamics simulation, steered molecular dynamics simulation, and replica-exchange molecular dynamics simulation. The S-shaped triple-{$\beta$} motif showed remarkable structural stability because of its complex residual interactions that form stable hydrophobic cores. The triple-{$\beta$} structure of A{$\beta$}42 is primarily made up of three {$\beta$}-sheet regions and two hydrophobic cores formed between {$\beta$}-sheet regions. Our analysis of {$\beta$}-sheet rupture patterns between adjacent chains showed that its two hydrophobic cores have different degrees of stability, indicating a lock phase mechanism. Our analysis of the docking pathway of monomeric A{$\beta$}42 to the fibril motif using REMD simulations showed that each of the three {$\beta$}-sheet sequences plays a distinct role in the docking process by changing their conformational features. Our results provide an understanding for the stability and consequent high toxicity of the triple-{$\beta$} structure A{$\beta$}42}

  abstract = {Simulations of biological macromolecules are important in understanding the physical basis of complex processes such as protein folding. However, even with increasing computational capacity and specialized architectures, the ability to simulate protein folding at atomistic scales still remains challenging. This stems from the dual aspects of high dimensionality of protein conformational landscapes, and the inability of atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to sufficiently sample these landscapes to observe folding events. Machine learning/deep learning (ML/DL) techniques, when combined with atomistic MD simulations offer the opportunity to potentially overcome these limitations by: (1) effectively reducing the dimensionality of MD simulations to automatically build latent representations that correspond to biophysically relevant reaction coordinates (RCs), and (2) driving MD simulations to automatically sample potentially novel conformational states based on these RCs. We examine how coupling DL approaches with MD simulations can lead to effective approaches to fold small proteins on supercomputers. In particular, we study the computational costs and effectiveness of scaling DL-coupled MD workflows implemented using RADICAL-Cybertools in folding two prototypical systems, namely Fs-peptide and the fast-folding variant of the villin head piece protein. We demonstrate that a DL-coupled MD workflow is able to effectively learn latent representations and drive adaptive simulations. Compared to traditional MD-based approaches, our approach achieves an effective performance gain in sampling the folded states by at least 2.3x. Together, our study provides quantitative basis to understand how coupling DL approaches to MD simulations, can lead to effective performance gains and reduced times to solution on supercomputing resources.},

The benefits of this family-based treatment have also been shown to be enduring at five-year follow-up. All available studies of psychological treatments for adolescent AN, both controlled trials and case series, are reviewed here. Almost all of them involve parents in treatment. These studies show that the majority of patients, even those who are severely ill, can be treated quite successfully as outpatients provided that the parents participate in treatment. In this family-based treatment, parents are viewed as a resource rather than a hindrance. Optimism regarding these encouraging findings should be tempered until larger scale randomized trials have been conducted.},

  abstract = {Molecular dynamics simulations are being applied to increasingly complex systems, including those involving small endogenous compounds and drug molecules. In order to obtain meaningful and accurate data from these simulations, high-quality topologies for small molecules must be generated in a manner that is consistent with the derivation of the force field applied to the system. Often, force fields are designed for use with macromolecules such as proteins, making their transferability to other species challenging. Investigators are increasingly attracted to automated topology generation programs, although the quality of the resulting topologies remains unknown. Here we assess the applicability of the popular PRODRG server that generates small-molecule topologies for use with the GROMOS family of force fields. We find that PRODRG does not reproduce topologies for even the most well-characterized species in the force field due to inconsistent charges and charge groups. We assessed the effects of PRODRG-derived charges on several systems: pure liquids, amino acids at a hydrophobic-hydrophilic interface, and an enzyme-cofactor complex. We found that partial atomic charges generated by PRODRG are largely incompatible with GROMOS force fields, and the behavior of these systems deviates substantially from that of simulations using GROMOS parameters. We conclude by proposing several points as "best practices" for parametrization of small molecules under the GROMOS force fields. \textcopyright{} 2010 American Chemical Society.}

  abstract = {Protein force fields have been undergoing continual development since the first complete parameter sets were introduced nearly four decades ago. The functional forms that underlie these models have many common elements for the treatment of bonded and nonbonded forces, which are reviewed here. The most widely used force fields to date use a fixed-charge convention in which electronic polarization effects are treated via a mean-field approximation during partial charge assignment. Despite success in modeling folded proteins over many years, the fixed-charge assumption has limitations that cannot necessarily be overcome within their potential energy equations. To overcome these limitations, several force fields have recently been derived that explicitly treat electronic polarization effects with straightforward extensions of the potential energy functions used by nonpolarizable force fields. Here, we review the history of the most popular nonpolarizable force fields (AMBER, CHARMM, OPLS, and GROMOS) as well as studies that have validated them and applied them to studies of protein folding and misfolding. Building upon these force fields are more recent polarizable interaction potentials, including fluctuating charge models, POSSIM, AMOEBA, and the classical Drude oscillator. These force fields differ in their implementations but all attempt to model electronic polarization in a computationally tractable manner. Despite their recent emergence in the field of protein folding, several studies have already applied these polarizable models to challenging problems in this domain, including the role of polarization in folding free energies and sequence-specific effects on the stability of {$\alpha$}-helical structures.},

The familiar problem is the Euthyphro dilemma: if God wills something because it is good, then goodness is independent of God, so God becomes, morally speaking, de trop. On the other hand, if something is good because God wills it, then, given the absence of constraint on what God may will, moral truths are \textendash{} counterintuitively \textendash{} contingent. An examination of the kinds of necessity and possibility at work in this conundrum leads us to the most promising solution: there is a metaphysical connection between God and goodness. What he wills is an expression of his nature. But (and this is the unfamiliar angle), that solution now poses an acute problem for an understanding of the Incarnation. For if God is constitutive of goodness, and Christ is God incar- nate, then Christ is constitutive of goodness. But Christ, as a human, is subject to external moral evaluation and obligation, which entails that he is not constitutive of goodness. This meta- ethical difficulty is not easily met by the usual strategies by which Christ is understood to have two natures. Reflection on our moral relations to our past selves, however, suggests a way forward.},

A prime example is the elucidation of protein allosteric mechanisms, where localized perturbations transmit throughout a large macromolecule to generate a response signal. For example, the conversion of chemical to electrical signals during synaptic neurotransmission in the brain is achieved by specialized membrane proteins called pentameric ligand-gated ion channels. Here, the binding of a neurotransmitter results in a global conformational change to open an ion-conducting pore across the nerve cell membrane. X-ray crystallography has produced static structures of the open and closed states of the proton-gated GLIC pentameric ligand-gated ion channel protein, allowing for atomistic simulations that can uncover changes related to activation. We discuss a range of enhanced sampling approaches that could be used to explore activation mechanisms. In particular, we describe recent application of an atomistic string method, based on Roux's ``swarms of trajectories'' approach, to elucidate the sequence and interdependence of conformational changes during activation. We illustrate how this can be combined with transition analysis and Brownian dynamics to extract thermodynamic and kinetic information, leading to understanding of what controls ion channel function. \textcopyright{} 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Instructive signals mediated by changes in resting potential control proliferation, differentiation, cell shape, and apoptosis of stem, progenitor, and somatic cells. Of importance, however, cells are regulated not only by their own Vmem but also by the Vmem of their neighbors, forming networks via electrical synapses known as gap junctions. Spatiotemporal changes in Vmem distribution among nonneural somatic tissues regulate pattern formation and serve as signals that trigger limb regeneration, induce eye formation, set polarity of whole-body anatomical axes, and orchestrate craniofacial patterning. New tools for tracking and functionally altering Vmem gradients in vivo have identified novel roles for bioelectrical signaling and revealed the molecular pathways by which Vmem changes are transduced into cascades of downstream gene expression. Because channels and gap junctions are gated posttranslationally, bioelectrical networks have their own characteristic dynamics that do not reduce to molecular profiling of channel expression (although they couple functionally to transcriptional networks). The recent data provide an exciting opportunity to crack the bioelectric code, and learn to program cellular activity at the level of organs, not only cell types. The understanding of how patterning information is encoded in bioelectrical networks, which may require concepts from computational neuroscience, will have transformative implications for embryogenesis, regeneration, cancer, and synthetic bioengineering.},

  abstract = {Pattern formation, as occurs during embryogenesis or regeneration, is the crucial link between genotype and the functions upon which selection operates. Even cancer and aging can be seen as challenges to the continuous physiological processes that orchestrate individual cell activities toward the anatomical needs of an organism. Thus, the origin and maintenance of complex biological shape is a fundamental question for cell, developmental, and evolutionary biology, as well as for biomedicine. It has long been recognized that slow bioelectrical gradients can control cell behaviors and morphogenesis. Here, I review recent molecular data that implicate endogenous spatio-temporal patterns of resting potentials among non-excitable cells as instructive cues in embryogenesis, regeneration, and cancer. Functional data have implicated gradients of resting potential in processes such as limb regeneration, eye induction, craniofacial patterning, and head-tail polarity, as well as in metastatic transformation and tumorigenesis. The genome is tightly linked to bioelectric signaling, via ion channel proteins that shape the gradients, downstream genes whose transcription is regulated by voltage, and transduction machinery that converts changes in bioelectric state to second-messenger cascades. However, the data clearly indicate that bioelectric signaling is an autonomous layer of control not reducible to a biochemical or genetic account of cell state. The real-time dynamics of bioelectric communication among cells are not fully captured by transcriptomic or proteomic analyses, and the necessary-and-sufficient triggers for specific changes in growth and form can be physiological states, while the underlying gene loci are free to diverge. The next steps in this exciting new field include the development of novel conceptual tools for understanding the anatomical semantics encoded in non-neural bioelectrical networks, and of improved biophysical tools for reading and writing electrical state information into somatic tissues. Cracking the bioelectric code will have transformative implications for developmental biology, regenerative medicine, and synthetic bioengineering.},

Nucleotide-binding domain 1 (NBD1), one of two ABC domains in CFTR, also contains sites for the predominant CF-causing mutation and, potentially, for regulatory phosphorylation. We have determined crystal structures for mouse NBD1 in unliganded, ADP- and ATP-bound states, with and without phosphorylation. This NBD1 differs from typical ABC domains in having added regulatory segments, a foreshortened subdomain interconnection, and an unusual nucleotide conformation. Moreover, isolated NBD1 has undetectable ATPase activity and its structure is essentially the same independent of ligand state. Phe508, which is commonly deleted in CF, is exposed at a putative NBD1-transmembrane interface. Our results are consistent with a CFTR mechanism, whereby channel gating occurs through ATP binding in an NBD1-NBD2 nucleotide sandwich that forms upon displacement of NBD1 regulatory segments.},

Previous studies employing incomplete NBD1 domains have attributed this to aberrant folding of {$\Delta$}F508 NBD1. We report structural and biophysical studies on complete human NBD1 domains, which fail to demonstrate significant changes of in vitro stability or folding kinetics in the presence or absence of the {$\Delta$}F508 mutation. Crystal structures show minimal changes in protein conformation but substantial changes in local surface topography at the site of the mutation, which is located in the region of NBD1 believed to interact with the first membrane spanning domain of CFTR. These results raise the possibility that the primary effect of {$\Delta$}F508 is a disruption of proper interdomain interactions at this site in CFTR rather than interference with the folding of NBD1. Interestingly, increases in the stability of NBD1 constructs are observed upon introduction of second-site mutations that suppress the trafficking defect caused by the {$\Delta$}F508 mutation, suggesting that these suppressors might function indirectly by improving the folding efficiency of NBD1 in the context of the full-length protein. The human NBD1 structures also solidify the understanding of CFTR regulation by showing that its two protein segments that can be phosphorylated both adopt multiple conformations that modulate access to the ATPase active site and functional interdomain interfaces.},

  abstract = {The {$\Delta$}F508 mutation in nucleotide-binding domain 1 (NBD1) of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is the predominant cause of cystic fibrosis. Previous biophysical studies on human F508 and {$\Delta$}F508 domains showed only local structural changes restricted to residues 509-511 and only minor differences in folding rate and stability. These results were remarkable because {$\Delta$}F508 was widely assumed to perturb domain folding based on the fact that it prevents trafficking of CFTR out of the endoplasmic reticulum. However, the previously reported crystal structures did not come from matched F508 and {$\Delta$}F508 constructs, and the {$\Delta$}F508 structure contained additional mutations that were required to obtain sufficient protein solubility. In this article, we present additional biophysical studies of NBD1 designed to address these ambiguities. Mass spectral measurements of backbone amide 1H/2H exchange rates in matched F508 and {$\Delta$}F508 constructs reveal that {$\Delta$}F508 increases backbone dynamics at residues 509-511 and the adjacent protein segments but not elsewhere in NBD1. These measurements also confirm a high level of flexibility in the protein segments exhibiting variable conformations in the crystal structures. We additionally present crystal structures of a broader set of human NBD1 constructs, including one harboring the native F508 residue and others harboring the {$\Delta$}F508 mutation in the presence of fewer and different solubilizing mutations. The only consistent conformational difference is observed at residues 509-511. The side chain of residue V510 in this loop is mostly buried in all non-{$\Delta$}F508 structures but completely solvent exposed in all {$\Delta$}F508 structures. These results reinforce the importance of the perturbation {$\Delta$}F508 causes in the surface topography of NBD1 in a region likely to mediate contact with the transmembrane domains of CFTR. However, they also suggest that increased exposure of the 509-511 loop and increased dynamics in its vicinity could promote aggregation in vitro and aberrant intermolecular interactions that impede trafficking in vivo. \textcopyright{} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.},

Block-localized wave function energy decomposition (BLW-ED) analysis shows that the interaction between SO2 and DESs is dominated by a charge transfer interaction. After this interaction, the SO2 molecule becomes negatively charged, whereas the ChCl-glycerol molecule is positively charged, which is the result of Lewis acid-base interaction. The current result affords a theoretical proof that it is highly useful and efficient to manipulate the Lewis acidity of absorbents for SO2 capture. Moreover, hydrogen bonding as well as electrostatic interactions may also contribute to the stability of the complex. Structure analysis shows that solvent molecules will adjust their geometries to interact with SO2. In addition, the structure of SO2 is barely changed after interaction. The interaction energy between different cluster models and SO2 ranges from -6.8 to -14.4 kcal mol-1. It is found that the interaction energy is very sensitive to the solvent structure. The moderate interaction between ChCl-glycerol and SO2 is consistent with the concept that highly efficient solvents for SO2 absorption should not only be solvable but also regenerable. 0}

  abstract = {Additive force fields are designed to account for induced electronic polarization in a mean-field average way, using effective empirical fixed charges. The limitation of this approximation is cause for serious concerns, particularly in the case of lipid membranes, where the molecular environment undergoes dramatic variations over microscopic length scales. A polarizable force field based on the classical Drude oscillator offers a practical and computationally efficient framework for an improved representation of electrostatic interactions in molecular simulations. Building on the first-generation Drude polarizable force field for the dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPPC) molecule, the present effort was undertaken to improve this initial model and expand the force field to a wider range of phospholipid molecules. New lipids parametrized include dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC), dilauroylphosphatidylcholine (DLPC), 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC), 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC), dipalmitoylphosphatidylethanolamine (DPPE), 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (POPE), and 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DOPE). The iterative optimization protocol employed in this effort led to lipid models that achieve a good balance between reproducing quantum mechanical data on model compound representative of phospholipids and reproducing a range of experimental condensed phase properties of bilayers. A parametrization strategy based on a restrained ensemble\textendash maximum entropy methodology was used to help accurately match the experimental NMR order parameters in the polar headgroup region. All the parameters were developed to be compatible with the remainder of the Drude polarizable force field, which includes water, ions, proteins, DNA, and selected carbohydrates.},

  abstract = {The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is a Cl channel that apparently has evolved from an ancestral active transporter. Key to the CFTR's switch from pump to channel function may have been the appearance of one or more ``lateral portals.'' Such portals connect the cytoplasm to the transmembrane channel pore, allowing a continuous pathway for the electrodiffusional movement of Cl ions. However, these portals remain the least well-characterized part of the Cl transport pathway; even the number of functional portals is uncertain, and if multiple portals do exist, their relative functional contributions are unknown. Here, we used patch-clamp recording to identify the contributions of positively charged amino acid side chains located in CFTR's cytoplasmic transmembrane extensions to portal function. Mutagenesis-medi-ated neutralization of several charged side chains reduced single-channel Cl conductance. However, these same mutations differentially affected channel blockade by cytoplasmic suramin and Pt(NO2)42 anions. We considered and tested several models by which the contribution of these positively charged side chains to one or more independent or non-independent portals to the pore could affect Cl conductance and interactions with blockers. Overall, our results suggest the existence of a single portal that is lined by several positively charged side chains that interact electrostatically with both Cl and blocking anions. We further propose that mutations at other sites indirectly alter the function of this single portal. Comparison of our functional results with recent structural information on CFTR completes our picture of the overall molecular architecture of the Cl permeation pathway.},

  abstract = {The relative prevalence of native protein-protein interactions (PPIs) are the cornerstone for understanding the structure, dynamics and mechanisms of function of protein complexes. In this study, we develop a scheme for scaling the protein-water interaction in the CHARMM36 force field, in order to better fit the solvation free energy of amino acids side-chain analogues. We find that the molecular dynamics simulation with the scaled force field, CHARMM36s, as well as a recently released version, CHARMM36m, effectively improve on the overly sticky association of proteins, such as ubiquitin. We investigate the formation of a heterodimer protein complex between the SAM domains of the EphA2 receptor and the SHIP2 enzyme by performing a combined total of 48 {$\mu$}s simulations with the different potential functions. While the native SAM heterodimer is only predicted at a low rate of 6.7\% with the original CHARMM36 force field, the yield is increased to 16.7\% with CHARMM36s, and to 18.3\% with CHARMM36m. By analyzing the 25 native SAM complexes formed in the simulations, we find that their formation involves a preorientation guided by Coulomb interactions, consistent with an electrostatic steering mechanism. In 12 cases, the complex could directly transform to the native protein interaction surfaces with only small adjustments in domain orientation. In the other 13 cases, orientational and/or translational adjustments are needed to reach the native complex. Although the tendency for non-native complexes to dissociate has nearly doubled with the modified potential functions, a dissociation followed by a reassociation to the correct complex structure is still rare. Instead, the remaining non-native complexes undergo configurational changes/surface searching, which, however, rarely leads to native structures on a time scale of 250 ns. These observations provide a rich picture of the mechanisms of protein-protein complex formation and suggest that computational predictions of native complex PPIs could be improved further.}

While the Drude-2013 protein FF has shown success in improving the folding properties of {$\alpha$}-helical peptides and to reproduce experimental observables in simulations up to 1 {$\mu$}s, some limitations were noted regarding the stability of {$\beta$}-sheet structures in simulations longer than 100 ns as well as larger deviations from crystal structures in simulations of a number of proteins compared to the additive CHARMM36 protein FF. The origin of the instability has been identified and appears to be primarily due to overestimated atomic polarizabilities and induced dipole-dipole interactions on the C{$\beta$}, C{$\gamma$} and C{$\delta$} side chain atoms. To resolve this and other issues, a number of aspects of the model were re-visited, resulting in Drude-2019 protein FF. Backbone parameters were optimized targeting the conformational properties of the (Ala)5 peptide in solution along with gas phase properties of the alanine dipeptide. Dipeptides that contain N-acetylated and N'-methylamidated termini, excluding Gly, Pro and Ala, were used as models to optimize the atomic polarizabilities and Thole screening factors on selected C{$\beta$}, C{$\gamma$} and C{$\delta$} carbons by targeting quantum mechanical (QM) dipole moments and molecular polarizabilities. In addition, to obtain better conformational properties, side chain {$\chi$}1 and {$\chi$}2 dihedral parameters were optimized targeting QM data for the respective side chain dipeptide conformations as well as PDB survey data based on the {$\chi$}1, {$\chi$}2 sampling from Hamiltonian replica-exchange MD simulations of (Ala)4-X-(Ala)4 in solution, where X is the amino acid of interest. Further improvements include optimizing nonbonded interactions between charged residues to reproduce QM interactions energies of the charged-protein model compounds and experimental osmotic pressures. Validation of the optimized Drude protein FF includes MD simulations of a collection of peptides and proteins including {$\beta$}-sheet structures, as well as transmembrane ion channels. Results showed that the updated Drude-2019 protein FF yields smaller overall RMS differences of proteins as compared to the additive CHARMM36m and Drude-2013 FFs as well as similar or improved agreement with experimental NMR properties, allowing for long timescale simulation studies of proteins and more complex biomolecular systems in conjunction with the remainder of the Drude polarizable FF.,},

The implementation has full support both for CHARMM-specific features such as multiple potentials over the same dihedral angle and the grid-based energy correction map on the {$\varphi$}, {$\psi$} protein backbone dihedrals, as well as all GROMACS features such as virtual hydrogen interaction sites that enable 5 fs time steps. The medium-to-long time effects of both the correction maps and virtual sites have been tested by performing a series of 100 ns simulations using different models for water representation, including comparisons between CHARMM and traditional TIP3P. Including the correction maps improves sampling of near native-state conformations in our systems, and to some extent it is even able to refine distorted protein conformations. Finally, we show that this accuracy is largely maintained with a new implicit solvent implementation that works with virtual interaction sites, which enables performance in excess of 250 ns/day for a 900-atom protein on a quad-core desktop computer.

In simulations conducted with a single physics-based energy function, the proteins, representing all three major structural classes, spontaneously and repeatedly fold to their experimentally determined native structures. Early in the folding process, the protein backbone adopts a nativelike topology while certain secondary structure elements and a small number of nonlocal contacts form. In most cases, folding follows a single dominant route in which elements of the native structure appear in an order highly correlated with their propensity to form in the unfolded state.}

However, a filter controlling selectivity among different anions has not previously been identified in any Cl- channel. In fact, because Cl- channels are only weakly selective among small anions, and because their selectivity has proved so resistant to site-directed mutagenesis, the very existence of a discrete anion selectivity filter has been called into question. Here we show that mutation of a putative pore-lining phenylalanine residue, F337, in the sixth membrane-spanning region of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) Cl- channel, dramatically alters the relative permeabilities of different anions in the channel. Specifically, mutations that reduce the size of the amino acid side chain present at this position virtually abolish the relationship between anion permeability and hydration energy, a relationship that characterizes the anion selectivity not only of wild-type CFTR, but of most classes of Cl- channels. These results suggest that the pore of CFTR may indeed contain a specialized region, analogous to the selectivity filter of cation channels, at which discrimination between different permeant anions takes place. Because F337 is adjacent to another amino acid residue, T338, which also affects anion selectivity in CFTR, we suggest that selectivity is predominantly determined over a physically discrete region of the pore located near these important residues.},

Specifically, experiments measured both the conductance of different anions and the ability of other permeant anions to block Cl- permeation through the pore. 2 Under symmetrical ionic conditions, wild-type CFTR channels showed the conductance sequence Cl- {$>$}NO3- {$>$}Br-{$\geq$}formate {$>$}F- {$>$}SCN-{$\sim$} ClO4-. 3 High SCN- conductance was not observed, nor was there an anomalous mole fraction effect of SCN- on conductance under the conditions used. Iodide currents could not be measured under symmetrical ionic conditions, but under bi-ionic conditions I- conductance appeared low. 4 Chloride currents through CFTR channels were blocked by low concentrations (10 mM) of SCN-, I- and ClO4-, implying relatively tight binding of these anions within the pore. 5 Two mutations in CFTR which alter the anion permeability sequence, F337S and T338A, also altered the anion conductance sequence. Furthermore, block by SCN-, I- and ClO4- were weakened in both mutants. Both these effects are consistent with altered anion binding within the pore. 6 The effects of mutations on anion permeability and relative anion conductance suggested that, for most anions, increased permeability was associated with increased conductance. This indicates that the CFTR channel pore does not achieve its anion selectivity by selective anion binding within the mutated region. Instead, it is suggested that entry of anions into the region around F337 and T338 facilitates their passage through the pore. In wild-type CFTR channels, anion entry into this crucial pore region is probably dominated by anion hydration energies.},

  abstract = {The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) functions as a Cl- channel important in transepithelial salt and water transport. While there is a paucity of direct structural information on CFTR, much has been learned about the molecular determinants of the CFTR Cl- channel pore region and the mechanism of Cl- permeation through the pore from indirect structure\textendash function studies. The first and sixth transmembrane regions of the CFTR protein play major roles in forming the channel pore and determining its functional properties by interacting with permeating Cl- ions. Positively charged amino acid side-chains are involved in attracting negatively charged Cl- ions into the pore region, where they interact briefly with a number of discrete sites on the pore walls. The pore appears able to accommodate more than one Cl- ion at a time, and Cl- ions bound inside the pore are probably sensitive to one another's presence. Repulsive interactions between Cl- ions bound concurrently within the pore may be important in ensuring rapid movement of Cl- ions through the pore. Chloride ion binding sites also interact with larger anions that can occlude the pore and block Cl- permeation, thus inhibiting CFTR function. Other ions besides Cl- are capable of passing through the pore, and specific amino acid residues that may be important in allowing the channel to discriminate between different anions have been identified. This brief review summarizes these mechanistic insights and tries to incorporate them into a simple cartoon model depicting the interactions between the channel and Cl- ions that are important for ion translocation.},

  abstract = {All ion channels are able to discriminate between substrate ions to some extent, a process that involves specific interactions between permeant anions and the so-called selectivity filter within the channel pore. In the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) anion-selective channel, both anion relative permeability and anion relative conductance are dependent on anion free energy of hydration--anions that are relatively easily dehydrated tend to show both high permeability and low conductance. In the present work, patch clamp recording was used to investigate the relative conductance of different anions in CFTR, and the effect of mutations within the channel pore. In constitutively-active E1371Q-CFTR channels, the anion conductance sequence was Cl(-) {$>$} NO3(-) {$>$} Br(-) {$>$} formate {$>$} SCN(-) {$>$} I(-). A mutation that disrupts anion binding in the inner vestibule of the pore (K95Q) disrupted anion conductance selectivity, such that anions with different permeabilities showed almost indistinguishable conductances. Conversely, a mutation at the putative narrowest pore region that is known to disrupt anion permeability selectivity (F337A) had minimal effects on anion relative conductance. Ion competition experiments confirmed that relatively tight binding of permeant anions resulted in relatively low conductance. These results suggest that the relative affinity of ion binding in the inner vestibule of the pore controls the relative conductance of different permeant anions in CFTR, and that the pore has two physically distinct anion selectivity filters that act in series to control anion conductance selectivity and anion permeability selectivity respectively.},

This review summarizes our current understanding of the architecture of the channel pore, as defined by electrophysiological analysis and molecular modeling studies. This includes consideration of the characteristic functional properties of the pore, definition of the overall shape of the entire extent of the pore, and discussion of how the molecular structure of distinct regions of the pore might control different facets of pore function. Comparisons are drawn with closely related proteins that are not ion channels, and also with structurally unrelated proteins with anion channel function.

CFTR is a member of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) family of membrane transport proteins, most members of which function as ATP-dependent pumps. CFTR is unique among human ABC proteins in functioning not as a pump, but as an ion channel. Recent structural data has indicated that CFTR shares broadly similar overall architecture and ATP-dependent conformational changes as other ABC proteins. Functional investigations suggest that CFTR has a unique open portal connecting the cytoplasm to the transmembrane channel pore, that allows for a continuous pathway for Cl- ions to cross the membrane in one conformation. This lateral portal may be what allows CFTR to function as an ion channel rather than as a pump, suggesting a plausible mechanism by which channel function may have evolved in CFTR.},

High Cl- conductance is dependent on electrostatic attraction of cytoplasmic Cl- ions by four positively charged amino acid side-chains located within this portal. Here we use a mutagenic approach to investigate the functional effects of transplanting or supplementing these positive charges at nearby portal-lining sites. Using patch clamp recording, we find that the functionally important positive charges at K190 and R303 can be transplanted to four nearby sites (N186, L197, W356, and A367) with little loss of Cl- conductance. Introduction of additional positive charge at these sites had almost no effect on Cl- conductance, but did increase the sensitivity to channel block by intracellular suramin and Pt(NO2)42- anions. We suggest that it is the number of positive charges within the portal, rather than their exact location, that is the most important factor influencing Cl- conductance. The portal appears well optimized in terms of charge distribution to maximize Cl- conductance.},

The bactericidal mechanism of antimicrobial peptides has been linked to membrane permeation and metabolism disruption as well as interruption of DNA and protein functions. However, the exact bacterial killing mechanism of gramicidin A is not clearly understood. In the present study, we examined the antimicrobial activity of gramicidin A on Staphylococcus aureus using biochemical and biophysical methods, including hydroxyl radical and NAD+/NADH cycling assays, atomic force microscopy, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Gramicidin A induced membrane permeabilization and changed the composition of the membrane. The morphology of Staphylococcus aureus during gramicidin A destruction was divided into four stages: pore formation, water permeability, bacterial flattening, and lysis. Changes in membrane composition included the destruction of membrane lipids, proteins, and carbohydrates. Most interestingly, we demonstrated that gramicidin A not only caused membrane permeabilization but also induced the formation of hydroxyl radicals, which are a possible end product of the transient depletion of NADH from the tricarboxylic acid cycle. The latter may be the main cause of complete Staphylococcus aureus killing. This new finding may provide insight into the underlying bactericidal mechanism of gA.},

  abstract = {Many biological processes are based on molecular recognition between highly charged molecules such as nucleic acids, inorganic ions, charged amino acids, etc. For such cases, it has been demonstrated that molecular simulations with fixed partial charges often fail to achieve experimental accuracy. Although incorporation of more advanced electrostatic models (such as multipoles, mutual polarization, etc.) can significantly improve simulation accuracy, it increases computational expense by a factor of 5-20\texttimes. Indirect free energy (IFE) methods can mitigate this cost by modeling intermediate states at fixed-charge resolution. For example, an efficient "reference" model such as a pairwise Amber, CHARMM, or OPLS-AA force field can be used to derive an initial estimate, followed by thermodynamic corrections to a more advanced "target" potential such as the polarizable AMOEBA model. Unfortunately, all currently described IFE methods encounter difficulties reweighting more than {$\sim$}50 atoms between resolutions due to extensive scaling of both the magnitude of the thermodynamic corrections and their statistical uncertainty. We present an approach called "simultaneous bookending" (SB) that is fundamentally different from existing IFE methods based on a tunable sampling approximation, which permits scaling to thousands of atoms. SB is demonstrated on the relative binding affinity of Mg2+/Ca2+ to a set of metalloproteins with up to 2972 atoms, finding no statistically significant difference between direct AMOEBA results and those from correcting Amber to AMOEBA. The ability to change the resolution of thousands of atoms during reweighting suggests the approach may be applicable in the future to protein-protein binding affinities or nucleic acid thermodynamics.}

The approach is demonstrated to reduce the dimensionality of the problem by 1 or 2 orders of magnitude, directly leading to corresponding savings in the computation and storage of the necessary matrices and a speedup of 2 to 4 orders of magnitude in solving the eigenvalue problem. We demonstrate the method on extensive data sets of protein conformational changes and protein-ligand binding using the variational approach to conformation dynamics (VAC) and time-lagged independent component analysis (TICA).

  abstract = {Some studies of CFTR imply that channel activation can be explained by an increase in open probability (Po), whereas others suggest that activation involves an increase in the number of CFTR channels (N) in the plasma membrane. Using two-electrode voltage clamp, we tested for changes in N associated with activation of CFTR in Xenopus oocytes using a cysteine-substituted construct (R334C CFTR) that can be modified by externally applied, impairment thiol reagents like [2-(trimethylammonium)ethyl] methanethiosulfonate bromide (MTSET+). Covalent modification of R334C CFTR with MTSET+ doubled the conductance and changed the I-V relation from inward rectifying to linear and was completely reversed by 2-mercaptoethanol (2-ME). Thus, labeled and unlabeled channels could be differentiated by noting the percent decrease in conductance brought about by exposure to 2-ME. When oocytes were briefly (20 s) exposed to MTSET+ before CFTR activation, the subsequently activated conductance was characteristic of labeled R334C CFTR, indicating that the entire pool of CFTR channels activated by cAMP was accessible to MTSET+. The addition of unlabeled, newly synthesized channels to the plasma membrane could be monitored on-line during the time when the rate of addition was most rapid after cRNA injection. The addition of new channels could be detected as early as 5 h after cRNA injection, occurred with a half time of {$\sim$}24-48 h, and was disrupted by exposing oocytes to Brefeldin A, whereas activation of R334C CFTR by cAMP occurred with a half time of tens of minutes, and did not appear to involve the addition of new channels to the plasma membrane. These findings demonstrate that in Xenopus oocytes, the major mechanism of CFTR activation by cAMP is by means of an increase in the open probability of CFTR channels.},

  abstract = {Cysteine scanning has been widely used to identify pore-lining residues in mammalian ion channels, including the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). These studies, however, have been typically conducted at room temperature rather than human body temperature. Reports of substantial effects of temperature on gating and anion conduction in CFTR channels as well as an unexpected pattern of cysteine reactivity in the sixth transmembrane segment (TM6), prompted us to investigate the effect of temperature on the reactivity of cysteines engineered into TM6 of CFTR. We compared reaction rates at temperatures ranging from 22\textdegree C to 37\textdegree C for cysteines placed on either side of an apparent size-selective, accessibility barrier previously defined by comparing reactivity toward channel-permeant and channel-impermeant, thiol-directed reagents. The results indicate that reactivity of cysteines at three positions extracellular to the position of the accessibility barrier, 334, 336 and 337, is highly temperature dependent, such that at 37\textdegree C cysteines at these positions were highly reactive toward MTSES-, whereas at 22\textdegree C the reaction rates ranged from two to six-fold slower to undetectable. An activation energy of 157 kJ/mole for the reaction at 337 is consistent with the hypothesis that, at physiological temperature, the extracellular portion of the CFTR pore can adopt conformations that differ significantly from those accessible at room temperature. However, the position of the accessibility barrier defined empirically by applying channel-permeant and channel-impermeant reagents to the extracellular aspect of the pore is not altered. The results illuminate previous scanning results and indicate that assay temperature is a critical variable in studies designed to use chemical modification to test structural models for the CFTR anion conduction pathway.},

Primary prostate and mammary cells, for example, are reprogrammed toward a basaloid, stem-like phenotype and form well-organized prostaspheres and mammospheres in Matrigel. However, in contrast to the selection of rare stem-like cells, the described growth conditions can generate 2 \texttimes{} 10(6) cells in 5 to 6 days from needle biopsies, and can generate cultures from cryopreserved tissue and from fewer than four viable cells. Continued cell proliferation is dependent on both feeder cells and Y-27632, and the conditionally reprogrammed cells (CRCs) retain a normal karyotype and remain nontumorigenic. This technique also efficiently establishes cell cultures from human and rodent tumors. For example, CRCs established from human prostate adenocarcinoma displayed instability of chromosome 13, proliferated abnormally in Matrigel, and formed tumors in mice with severe combined immunodeficiency. The ability to rapidly generate many tumor cells from small biopsy specimens and frozen tissue provides significant opportunities for cell-based diagnostics and therapeutics (including chemosensitivity testing) and greatly expands the value of biobanking. In addition, the CRC method allows for the genetic manipulation of epithelial cells ex vivo and their subsequent evaluation in vivo in the same host.},

Here, we present a 3.9~\AA{} structure of dephosphorylated human CFTR without nucleotides, determined by electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM). Close resemblance of this human CFTR structure to zebrafish CFTR under identical conditions reinforces its relevance for understanding CFTR function. The human CFTR structure reveals a previously unresolved helix belonging to the R domain docked inside the intracellular vestibule, precluding channel opening. By analyzing the sigmoid time course of CFTR current activation, we propose that PKA phosphorylation of the R domain is enabled by its infrequent spontaneous disengagement, which also explains residual ATPase and gating activity of dephosphorylated CFTR. From comparison with MRP1, a feature distinguishing CFTR from all other ABC transporters is the helix-loop transition in transmembrane helix 8, which likely forms the structural basis for CFTR's channel function.},

We sought to identify the genetic underpinnings of syndromic, sporadic DCM in a newborn female diagnosed in utero. Postnatal evaluation revealed ventricular dilation and systolic dysfunction, bilateral cataracts, and mild facial dysmorphisms. Comprehensive metabolic and genetic testing, including chromosomal microarray, mitochondrial DNA and targeted RASopathy gene sequencing, and clinical whole exome sequencing for known cardiomyopathy genes was non-diagnostic. Following exclusion of asymptomatic DCM in the parents, trio-based whole exome sequencing was carried out on a research basis, filtering for rare, predicted deleterious de novo and recessive variants. An unreported de novo S75Y mutation was discovered in RRAGC, encoding Ras-related GTP binding C, an essential GTPase in nutrient-activated mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling. In silico protein modeling and molecular dynamics simulation predicted the mutation to disrupt ligand interactions and increase the GDP-bound state. Overexpression of RagCS75Y rendered AD293 cells partially insensitive to amino acid deprivation, resulting in increased mTORC1 signaling compared to wild-type RagC.

  abstract = {Processing mutations that inhibit folding and trafficking of CFTR are the main cause of cystic fibrosis (CF). A potential CF therapy would be to repair CFTR processing mutants. It has been demonstrated that processing mutants of P-glycoprotein (P-gp), CFTR's sister protein, can be efficiently repaired by a drug-rescue mechanism. Many arginine suppressors that mimic drug-rescue have been identified in the P-gp transmembrane (TM) domains (TMDs) that rescue by forming hydrogen bonds with residues in adjacent helices to promote packing of the TM segments. To test if CFTR mutants could be repaired by a drug-rescue mechanism, we used truncation mutants to test if corrector VX-809 interacted with the TMDs. VX-809 was selected for study because it is specific for CFTR, it is the most effective corrector identified to date, but it has limited clinical benefit. Identification of the VX-809 target domain will help to develop correctors with improved clinical benefits. It was found that VX-809 rescued truncation mutants lacking the NBD2 and R domains. When the remaining domains (TMD1, NBD1, TMD2) were expressed as separate polypeptides, VX-809 only increased the stability of TMD1. We then performed arginine mutagenesis on TM6 in TMD1. Although the results showed that TM6 had distinct lipid and aqueous faces, CFTR was different from P-gp as no arginine promoted maturation of CFTR processing mutants. The results suggest that TMD1 contains a VX-809 binding site, but its mechanism differed from P-gp drug-rescue. We also report that V510D acts as a universal suppressor to rescue CFTR processing mutants. \textcopyright{} 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

The best corrector, VX-809 (Lumacaftor), has shown some promise when used in combination with a potentiator (Ivacaftor). Understanding the mechanism of VX-809 is essential for development of better correctors. Here, we tested our prediction that VX-809 repairs folding and processing defects of CFTR by promoting interactions between the first cytoplasmic loop (CL1) of transmembrane domain 1 (TMD1) and the first nucleotide-binding domain (NBD1). To investigate whether VX-809 promoted CL1/NBD1 interactions, we performed cysteine mutagenesis and disulfide cross-linking analysis of Cys-less TMD1 (residues 1\textendash 436) and {$\Delta$}TMD1 (residues 437\textendash 1480; NBD1-R-TMD2-NBD2) truncation mutants. It was found that VX-809, but not bithiazole correctors, promoted maturation (exited endoplasmic reticulum for addition of complex carbohydrate in the Golgi) of the {$\Delta$}TMD1 truncation mutant only when it was co-expressed in the presence of TMD1. Expression in the presence of VX-809 also promoted cross-linking between R170C (in CL1 of TMD1 protein) and L475C (in NBD1 of the {$\Delta$}TMD1 truncation protein). Expression of the {$\Delta$}TMD1 truncation mutant in the presence of TMD1 and VX-809 also increased the half-life of the mature protein in cells. The results suggest that the mechanism by which VX-809 promotes maturation and stability of CFTR is by promoting CL1/NBD1 interactions.},

  abstract = {Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common life-threatening monogenic disease afflicting Caucasian people. It affects the respiratory, gastrointestinal, glandular and reproductive systems. The major cause of morbidity and mortality in CF is the respiratory disorder caused by a vicious cycle of obstruction of the airways, inflammation and infection that leads to epithelial damage, tissue remodeling and end-stage lung disease. Over the past decades, life expectancy of CF patients has increased due to early diagnosis and improved treatments; however, these patients still present limited quality of life. Many attempts have been made to rescue CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) expression, function and stability, thereby overcoming the molecular basis of CF. Gene and protein variances caused by CFTR mutants lead to different CF phenotypes, which then require different treatments to quell the patients' debilitating symptoms. In order to seek better approaches to treat CF patients and maximize therapeutic effects, CFTR mutants have been stratified into six groups (although several of these mutations present pleiotropic defects). The research with CFTR modulators (read-through agents, correctors, potentiators, stabilizers and amplifiers) has achieved remarkable progress, and these drugs are translating into pharmaceuticals and personalized treatments for CF patients. This review summarizes the main molecular and clinical features of CF, emphasizes the latest clinical trials using CFTR modulators, sheds light on the molecular mechanisms underlying these new and emerging treatments, and discusses the major breakthroughs and challenges to treating all CF patients.}

Despite recent advances in precision medicines for CF patients, many CFTR mutants have not been characterized and the effects of these new therapeutic approaches are still unclear for those mutants. Methods: Cells transfected or stably expressing four CFTR transmembrane-domain mutants (G85E, E92K, L1077P, and M1101K) were used to: 1) characterize the mutants according to their protein expression, thermal sensitivity, and degradation pathways; 2) evaluate the effects of correctors in rescuing them; and 3) explore the effects of correctors on CFTR interactions with proteostasis components. Results: All four mutants exhibited lower protein expression than did wild type-CFTR, and they were degraded by proteasomes and aggresomes. At low temperature, only cells expressing the mutants L1077P and M1101K exhibited increased CFTR maturation. Co-administration of C4 and C18 showed the greatest effect, restoring functional expression and partial stability of CFTR bearing E92K, L1077P, or M1101K at the cell surface. However, this treatment was inefficient in rectifying the defect of CFTR bearing G85E. Correctors rescued CFTR mutants by reducing their interactions with proteostasis components associated with protein retention in the endoplasmic reticulum and ubiquitination. Conclusion: Co-administration of C4 and C18 rescued CFTR transmembrane-domain mutants by remodeling the CFTR interactome.},

  abstract = {Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a lethal inherited disease caused by mutations in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene, which result in impairment of CFTR mRNA and protein expression, function, stability or a combination of these. Although CF leads to multifaceted clinical manifestations, the respiratory disorder represents the major cause of morbidity and mortality of these patients. The life expectancy of CF patients has substantially lengthened due to early diagnosis and improvements in symptomatic therapeutic regimens. Quality of life remains nevertheless limited, as these individuals are subjected to considerable clinical, psychosocial and economic burdens. Since the discovery of the CFTR gene in 1989, tremendous efforts have been made to develop therapies acting more upstream on the pathogenesis cascade, thereby overcoming the underlying dysfunctions caused by CFTR mutations. In this line, the advances in cell-based high-throughput screenings have been facilitating the fast-tracking of CFTR modulators. These modulator drugs have the ability to enhance or even restore the functional expression of specific CF-causing mutations, and they have been classified into five main groups depending on their effects on CFTR mutations: potentiators, correctors, stabilizers, read-through agents, and amplifiers. To date, four CFTR modulators have reached the market, and these pharmaceutical therapies are transforming patients' lives with short- and long-term improvements in clinical outcomes. Such breakthroughs have paved the way for the development of novel CFTR modulators, which are currently under experimental and clinical investigations. Furthermore, recent insights into the CFTR structure will be useful for the rational design of next-generation modulator drugs. This review aims to provide a summary of recent developments in CFTR-directed therapeutics. Barriers and future directions are also discussed in order to optimize treatment adherence, identify feasible and sustainable solutions for equitable access to these therapies, and continue to expand the pipeline of novel modulators that may result in effective precision medicine for all individuals with CF.}

Our methods is tested on a DPPC (no unsaturated chain), a POPC (one unsaturated chain), and a DOPC (two unsaturated chains) lipid bilayers. We calculate various physical properties of the membrane of our simulations with and without virtual sites and explain the differences and similarity observed. The best agreements are obtained for the GROMACS original virtual sites on the DOPC bilayer where we get an area per lipid of 67.3 {$\pm$} 0.3 A\r{}2 without virtual sites and 67.6 {$\pm$} 0.3 A\r{}2 with virtual sites. In conclusion the virtual-sites technique on lipid membranes is a powerful simulation tool, but it should be used with care.

The relative contributions of these mechanisms to Akt activity and signaling have hitherto not been understood. Here, we show that phosphorylation and activation by membrane binding are mutually interdependent. Moreover, the converse is also true: Akt is more rapidly dephosphorylated in the absence of PIP3, an autoinhibitory process driven by the interaction of its PH and kinase domains. We present biophysical evidence for the conformational changes in Akt that accompany its activation on membranes, show that Akt is robustly autoinhibited in the absence of PIP3 irrespective of its phosphorylation, and map the autoinhibitory PH-kinase interface. Finally, we present a model for the activation and inactivation of Akt by an ordered series of membrane binding, phosphorylation, dissociation, and dephosphorylation events.},

Here, we present a parallel implementation of linear-scaling density matrix trace correcting (TC) purification algorithm to solve the Kohn\textendash Sham (KS) equations with the numerical atomic orbitals in the HONPAS package. Such a linear-scaling density matrix purification algorithm is based on the Kohn's nearsightedness principle, resulting in a sparse Hamiltonian matrix with localized basis sets in the DFT calculations. Therefore, sparse matrix multiplication is the most time-consuming step in the density matrix purification algorithm for linear-scaling DFT calculations. We propose to use the MPI\_Allgather function for parallel programming to deal with the sparse matrix multiplication within the compressed sparse row (CSR) format, which can scale up to hundreds of processing cores on modern heterogeneous supercomputers. We demonstrate the computational accuracy and efficiency of this parallel density matrix purification algorithm by performing large-scale DFT calculations on boron nitrogen nanotubes containing tens of thousands of atoms.}

Whereas the activator was released from erythrocytes subjected to hemolysis in 20 miosM buffer at pH 7.6 or at pH 5.8, only the membranes prepared at pH 7.6 were affected by it. 2. Whereas the activator was released from erythrocytes subjected to hemolysis in 20 miosM buffer at pH 7.6 or at pH 5.8, only the membranes prepared at pH 7.6 were affected by it. 3. When (Ca2+ plus Mg2+)-ATPase activity was measured by 32Pi release from (gamma-32P)ATP, freeze-thawed erythrocytes, as well as membranes prepared at pH 5.8 and at pH 7.6, expressed lower values than noted by assay for total Pi release. When ADP instead of ATP was used as substrate, significant amount of Pi were released by these erythrocyte preparations. Further study revealed (a) production of ATP and AMP from ADP with membranes and hemolysate alone, and (b) exchange of the gamma-and B-position phosphate on (gama-32P)ATP in the presence of membranes plus hemolysates. These observations established the presence of adenylate kinase activity in the (membrane-free) hemolysates and in membranes. It further supports the conclusion that Pi release from ADP by human erythrocytes (freeze-thawed) and by their isolated membranes is due to formation of ATP by adenylate kinase and hydrolysis of this generated ATP by (Ca2+ plus Mg2+)-ATPase. 4. The following points were also established: (a) absence of an ADPase in human erythrocytes; (b) the (Ca2+ plus Mg2+)-ATPase activator enhanced cleavage only of the gama-position of ATP and (c) the (Ca2+ plus Mg2+)-ATPase activator is neither adenylate kinase nor hemoglobin.},

  abstract = {While originally characterized as a collection of related syndromes, cystic fibrosis (CF) is now recognized as a single disease whose diverse symptoms stem from the wide tissue distribution of the gene product that is defective in CF, the ion channel and regulator, cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). Defective CFTR protein impacts the function of the pancreas and alters the consistency of mucosal secretions. The latter of these effects probably plays an important role in the defective resistance of CF patients to many pathogens. As the modalities of CF research have changed over the decades from empirical histological studies to include biophysical measurements of CFTR function, the clinical management of this disease has similarly evolved to effectively address the ever-changing spectrum of CF-related infectious diseases. These factors have led to the successful management of many CF-related infections with the notable exception of chronic lung infection with the gram-negative bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The virulence of P. aeruginosa stems from multiple bacterial attributes, including antibiotic resistance, the ability to utilize quorum-sensing signals to form biofilms, the destructive potential of a multitude of its microbial toxins, and the ability to acquire a mucoid phenotype, which renders this microbe resistant to both the innate and acquired immunologic defenses of the host.},

  abstract = {This chapter discusses that high hydrostatic pressure affects equilibria and reaction rates through the molar volume changes involved in the reaction system as a whole. The chapter explains how high hydrostatic pressure affects molecules of biological interest, and their interactions; the ways in which pressure affects cellular processes; and how animals, including humans are affected by pressure. Along with high pressure, the chapter also intends to stimulate interest in a particular approach to physiology. The discussion on molecular effects of pressure and temperature includes equilibrium processes in aqueous solution, lipid bilayers under pressure and rates of chemical reactions. It is mentioned that hydrostatic pressure is not directional and that osmotic pressure is also quite separate from hydrostatic pressure. Hydrostatic pressure is a force acting in all directions, in the air one breathes, in water, or in body fluids. While high pressure, surprisingly perhaps, dissociates molecules in aqueous solution, it has the intuitively expected effect on lipid bilayers, compressing and ordering their structure. The thermodynamics of equilibrium processes in aqueous solution, and the phase state of lipid bilayers at high pressure, inevitably fall short of explaining how pressure affects rates of reaction. Muscle, a tissue whose cells are conspicuously filled with polymerized proteins, is affected by high pressure in ways determined by the contraction cycle. Simple processes, such as the diffusion of gases or water in aqueous solution, are little affected by the pressure range of interest here. Chondrocytes are cells, which synthesize the load-bearing extracellular matrixthat covers the articulating surfaces of joints. The buoyancy of aquatic animals subjected to significant pressure is interesting because buoyancy requires the creation of a void or region of low-density, working against the ambient pressure. Animals and bacteria live at high pressures in the deep sea, down to the greatest depths where the pressure is approximately 100 MPa. Several technological applications have arisen from high pressure biology\textemdash the manipulation of ploidy, and of membrane proteins; sterilization and inactivation of microorganisms; food processing; and safe human diving.},

  abstract = {Computational studies of proteins based on empirical force fields represent a powerful tool to obtain structure-function relationships at an atomic level, and are central in current efforts to solve the protein folding problem. The results from studies applying these tools are, however, dependent on the quality of the force fields used. In particular, accurate treatment of the peptide backbone is crucial to achieve representative conformational distributions in simulation studies. To improve the treatment of the peptide backbone, quantum mechanical (QM) and molecular mechanical (MM) calculations were undertaken on the alanine, glycine, and proline dipeptides, and the results from these calculations were combined with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of proteins in crystal and aqueous environments. QM potential energy maps of the alanine and glycine dipeptides at the LMP2/cc-pVxZ//MP2/6-31G* levels, where x = D, T, and Q, were determined, and are compared to available QM studies on these molecules. The LMP2/cc-pVQZ//MP2/6-31G* energy surfaces for all three dipeptides were then used to improve the MM treatment of the dipeptides. These improvements included additional parameter optimization via Monte Carlo simulated annealing and extension of the potential energy function to contain peptide backbone phi, psi dihedral crossterms or a phi, psi grid-based energy correction term. Simultaneously, MD simulations of up to seven proteins in their crystalline environments were used to validate the force field enhancements. Comparison with QM and crystallographic data showed that an additional optimization of the phi, psi dihedral parameters along with the grid-based energy correction were required to yield significant improvements over the CHARMM22 force field. However, systematic deviations in the treatment of phi and psi in the helical and sheet regions were evident. Accordingly, empirical adjustments were made to the grid-based energy correction for alanine and glycine to account for these systematic differences. These adjustments lead to greater deviations from QM data for the two dipeptides but also yielded improved agreement with experimental crystallographic data. These improvements enhance the quality of the CHARMM force field in treating proteins. This extension of the potential energy function is anticipated to facilitate improved treatment of biological macromolecules via MM approaches in general.},

  abstract = {Recent determination of the crystal structures of bacterial voltage-gated sodium (NaV) channels have raised hopes that modeling of the mammalian counterparts could soon be achieved. However, there are substantial differences between the pore domains of the bacterial and mammalian NaV channels, which necessitates careful validation of mammalian homology models constructed from the bacterial NaV structures. Such a validated homology model for the NaV1.4 channel was constructed recently using the extensive mutagenesis data available for binding of {$\mu$}-conotoxins. Here we use this NaV1.4 model to study the ion permeation mechanism in mammalian NaV channels. Linking of the DEKA residues in the selectivity filter with residues in the neighboring domains is found to be important for keeping the permeation pathway open. Molecular dynamics simulations and potential of mean force calculations reveal that there is a binding site for a Na+ ion just inside the DEKA locus, and 1-2 Na+ ions can occupy the vestibule near the EEDD ring. These sites are separated by a low free energy barrier, suggesting that inward conduction occurs when a Na+ ion in the vestibule goes over the free energy barrier and pushes the Na+ ion in the filter to the intracellular cavity, consistent with the classical knock-on mechanism. The NaV1.4 model also provides a good description of the observed Na+/K+ selectivity.}

The competition between different probes and water molecules allows the identification of the energetic preference of functional groups in different binding site moieties including enthalpic and entropic contributions. Cosolvent MD simulations have recently been applied to a variety of different questions in structure-based drug design but still have significant shortcomings. Among those issues is the limited chemical diversity of probe molecules ignoring the chemical context of the pharmacophoric feature represented by a probe. Here we present a novel cosolvent MD simulation method based on the {$\lambda$}-dynamics simulation concept that significantly increases the chemical diversity of functional groups investigated during cosolvent simulations. Application to four different test cases highlights the utility of the new approach to identify binding preferences of different functional groups and to correctly rank ligand series that differ by their substitution patterns.}

However, slow translational and rotational diffusion of protein in membrane presents challenges to the effective sampling of conformations defining the ensembles of free and bound states contributing to the association equilibrium and the free energy of dimerization. We revisit the homodimerization equilibrium of the TM region of glycophorin A. Conformational sampling is performed using umbrella sampling along previously proposed one-dimensional collective variables and compared with sampling over a two-dimensional collective variable space using the MARTINI v2.2 force field. We demonstrate that the one-dimensional collective variables suffer from restricted sampling of the native homodimer conformations leading to a biased free energy landscape. Conversely, simulations along the two-dimensional collective variable effectively characterize the thermodynamically relevant native and non-native interactions contributing to the association equilibrium. These results demonstrate the challenges associated with accurately characterizing binding equilibria when multiple poses contribute to the bound state ensemble.},

This article highlights major advances in our understanding of how CFTR dysfunction causes chronic mucus obstruction, neutrophilic inflammation and bacterial infection in CF airways. Furthermore, we focus on recent breakthroughs and remaining challenges of novel therapies targeting the basic CF defect, and discuss the next steps to be taken to make disease-modifying therapies available to a larger group of patients with CF, including those carrying the most common mutation {$\Delta$}F508-CFTR. Finally, we will summarise emerging evidence indicating that acquired CFTR dysfunction may be implicated in the pathogenesis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, suggesting that lessons learned from CF may be applicable to common airway diseases associated with mucus plugging.},

We follow an approach introduced recently for the optimization of monovalent ions, based on the simultaneous optimization of single-ion and ion-pair properties. We consider the solvation free energy of the divalent cations as the relevant single-ion property. As a probe for ion-pair properties we compute the activity derivatives of the salt solutions. The optimization of the ionic force fields is done in two consecutive steps. First, the cation solvation free energy is determined as a function of the Lennard-Jones (LJ) parameters. The peak in the ion-water radial distribution function (RDF) is used as a check of the structural properties of the ions. Second, the activity derivatives of the electrolytes MgY2, CaY2, BaY2, SrY2 are determined through Kirkwood-Buff solution theory, where Y = Cl-, Br-, I-. The activity derivatives are determined for the restricted set of LJ parameters which reproduce the exact solvation free energy of the divalent cations. The optimal ion parameters are those that match the experimental activity data and therefore simultaneously reproduce single-ion and ion-pair thermodynamic properties. For Ca2+, Ba2+, and Sr2+ such LJ parameters exist. On the other hand, for Mg2+ the experimental activity derivatives can only be reproduced if we generalize the combination rule for the anion-cation LJ interaction and rescale the effective cation-anion LJ radius, which is a modification that leaves the cation solvation free energy invariant. The divalent cation force fields are transferable within acceptable accuracy, meaning the same cation force field is valid for all halide ions Cl-, Br-, I- tested in this study.}

Despite their importance, our understanding of protein PTMs at the atomistic level is still largely incomplete. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, which provide high-resolution insight into biomolecular function and underlying mechanisms, are in principle ideally suited to tackle this problem. However, because of the challenges associated with the development of novel MD parameters and a general lack of suitable computational tools for incorporating PTMs in target protein structures, MD simulations of post-translationally modified proteins have historically lagged significantly behind the studies of unmodified proteins. Here, we present Vienna-PTM web server (http://vienna-ptm.univie.ac.at), a platform for automated introduction of PTMs of choice to protein 3D structures (PDB files) in a user-friendly visual environment. With 256 different enzymatic and non-enzymatic PTMs available, the server performs geometrically realistic introduction of modifications at sites of interests, as well as subsequent energy minimization. Finally, the server makes available force field parameters and input files needed to run MD simulations of modified proteins within the framework of the widely used GROMOS 54A7 and 45A3 force fields and GROMACS simulation package.}

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}NMR spectroscopy is a powerful tool for biologists interested in the structure, dynamics, and interactions of biological macromolecules. This review aims at presenting in an accessible manner the requirements and limitations of this technique. As an introduction, the history of NMR will highlight how the method evolved from physics to chemistry and finally to biology over several decades. We then introduce the NMR spectral parameters used in structural biology, namely the chemical shift, the J-coupling, nuclear Overhauser effects, and residual dipolar couplings. Resonance assignment, the required step for any further NMR study, bears a resemblance to jigsaw puzzle strategy. The NMR spectral parameters are then converted into angle and distances and used as input using restrained molecular dynamics to compute a bundle of structures. When interpreting a NMR-derived structure, the biologist has to judge its quality on the basis of the statistics provided. When the 3D structure is a priori known by other means, the molecular interaction with a partner can be mapped by NMR: information on the binding interface as well as on kinetic and thermodynamic constants can be gathered. NMR is suitable to monitor, over a wide range of frequencies, protein fluctuations that play a crucial role in their biological function. In the last section of this review, intrinsically disordered proteins, which have escaped the attention of classical structural biology, are discussed in the perspective of NMR, one of the rare available techniques able to describe structural ensembles.

The characteristic self-diffusion coefficients D and radial distribution functions, gOO, gOH, and gHH for all five water models were determined and compared to experimental data. The effects of velocity rescaling on the self-diffusion coefficient D were examined. All these empirical water models used in this study are similar by having three interaction sites, but the small differences in their pair potentials composed of Lennard-Jones (LJ) and Coulombic terms give significant differences in the calculated self-diffusion coefficients, and in the height of the second peak of the radial distribution function gOO.}

  abstract = {Cystic fibrosis is an autosomal recessive disease caused by mutation of the gene coding for the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regular (CFTR) chloride channel. Complications due to chronic lung infections are the leading cause of mortality seen in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. Two opposing hypotheses for the mechanism of bacterial colonization of cystic fibrosis lungs have co-existed for nearly two decades. The ``high salt'' hypothesis posits that the bacterial colonization of CF lungs is due to an elevated concentration of sodium and chloride in airway surface liquid (ASL) which inhibits native bactericidal activity. The ``low volume'' hypothesis, on the other hand, proposes that the volume of the ASL is severely decreased as a result of abnormally increased sodium absorption, which causes cilia to collapse and halt mucus clearance. An analysis of published data for sodium and chloride concentrations measured in the liquid lining of lungs, as well as ASL depth, was conducted. The original published data sets obtained and evaluated in this systematic review provided weak support for either a significant difference in salt concentrations (sodium: p = 0.316, chloride: p = 0.30) or depth (p = 0.16). This study found both hypotheses has yet established itself to be more viable and an alternative mechanism for initial bacterial colonization of the lungs in cystic fibrosis is proposed.},

Proteins are also dynamic in evolution: significant variations in secondary, tertiary and quaternary structure can be observed among divergent members of a protein family. Recent work has highlighted intriguing similarities between these structural and evolutionary dynamics occurring at various levels. Here we review evidence showing how evolutionary changes in protein sequence and structure are often closely related to local protein flexibility and disorder, large-scale motions and quaternary structure assembly. We suggest that these correspondences can be largely explained by neutral evolution, while deviations between structural and evolutionary dynamics can provide valuable functional insights. Finally, we address future prospects for the field and practical applications that arise from a deeper understanding of the intimate relationship between protein structure, dynamics, function and evolution. \textcopyright{} 2014 WILEY Periodicals, Inc.},

Here, we show that conditionally reprogrammed airway epithelial cells (CRAECs) can be established from both healthy and diseased phenotypes. CRAECs can be expanded, cryopreserved and maintain phenotypes over at least 5 passages. Population doublings of CRAEC cultures were significantly greater than standard cultures, but maintained their lineage characteristics. CRAECs from all phenotypes were also capable of fully differentiating at air-liquid interface (ALI) and maintained disease specific characteristics including; defective CFTR channel function cultures and the inability to repair wounds. Our findings indicate that CRAECs derived from children maintain lineage, phenotypic and importantly disease-specific functional characteristics over a specified passage range.},

In cystic fibrosis it may soon be possible to test several corrector drugs that improve the folding and functional expression of mutant cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) prospectively using cells from a patient to find the one that is best for that individual. Patient-to-patient variation in cell culture responses to correctors and the reproducibility of those responses has not been studied quantitatively. We measured the functional correction provided by lumacaftor (VX-809) using bronchial epithelial cells from 20 patients homozygous for the F508del-CFTR mutation. Significant differences were observed between individuals, supporting the utility of prospective testing. However, when correction of F508del-CFTR was measured repeatedly using cell aliquots from the same individuals, a design effect was observed that would impact statistical tests of significance. The results suggest that the sample size obtained from power calculations should be increased to compensate for group sampling when CFTR corrector drugs are compared in vitro for precision medicine.},

There are, however, a few striking effects in performance of algorithms which are well known but have not received adequate attention in the literature. A closer view of these unclear observations results in unexpected conclusions. It is shown here that contrary to the conventional point of view, the leapfrog scheme is distinguished in this group both in terms of the order of truncation errors and the conservation of the total energy. In this case the characteristic square growth of fluctuations of the total energy with the step size, commonly measured in numerical tests, results from additional interpolation errors with no relation to the accuracy of the computed trajectory. An alternative procedure is described for checking energy conservation of leapfrog-like algorithms which is free from interpolation errors.

  abstract = {Native mass spectrometry (MS) is a powerful means for studying macromolecular protein assemblies, including accessing activated states. However, much remains to be understood about what governs which regions of the protein (un)folding funnel, which can be explored by activation of protein ions in a vacuum. Here, we examine the trajectory that Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1) dimers take over the unfolding and dissociation free energy landscape in a vacuum. We examined wild-type SOD1 and six disease-related point mutants by using tandem MS and ion-mobility MS as a function of collisional activation. For six of the seven SOD1 variants, increasing activation prompted dimers to transition through two unfolding events and dissociate symmetrically into monomers with (as near as possible) equal charges. The exception was G37R, which proceeded only through the first unfolding transition and displayed a much higher abundance of asymmetric products. Supported by the observation that ejected asymmetric G37R monomers were more compact than symmetric G37R ones, we localized this effect to the formation of a gas-phase salt bridge in the first activated conformation. To examine the data quantitatively, we applied Arrhenius-type analysis to estimate the barriers on the corresponding free energy landscape. This reveals a heightening of the barrier to unfolding in G37R by {$>$}5 kJ/mol-1 over the other variants, consistent with expectations for the strength of a salt bridge. Our work demonstrates weaknesses in the simple general framework for understanding protein complex dissociation in a vacuum and highlights the importance of individual residues, their local environment, and specific interactions in governing product formation.}

The clinical benefits of this approach are already being realised in rare diseases and cancer but the impact on management of complex diseases, such as type 2 diabetes, remains limited. This may reflect reliance on inappropriate models of disease architecture, based around rare, high-impact genetic and environmental exposures that are poorly suited to our emerging understanding of type 2 diabetes. This review proposes an alternative `palette' model, centred on a molecular taxonomy that focuses on positioning an individual with respect to the major pathophysiological processes that contribute to diabetes risk and progression. This model anticipates that many individuals with diabetes will have multiple parallel defects that affect several of these processes. One corollary of this model is that research efforts should, at least initially, be targeted towards identifying and characterising individuals whose adverse metabolic trajectory is dominated by perturbation in a restricted set of processes.},

We recently used an inducible overexpression strategy to generate recombinant CFTR protein at levels suitable for purification and detailed analysis. Using liquid chromatography (LC) tandem and multiple reaction ion monitoring (MRM) mass spectrometry, we identified specific sites of PTMs, including palmitoylation, phosphorylation, methylation and possible ubiquitination. Many of these covalent CFTR modifications have not been described previously, but are likely to influence key and clinically important molecular processes including protein maturation, gating and the mechanisms underlying certain mutations associated with disease. \textcopyright{} The Author 2011.},

  abstract = {In mammals, glucose transporters (GLUT) control organism-wide blood glucose homeostasis. In human, this is accomplished by fourteen different GLUT isoforms, that transport glucose and other monosaccharides with varying substrate preferences and kinetics. Nevertheless, there is little difference between the sugar-coordinating residues in the GLUT proteins and even the malarial plasmodium falciparum transporter PfHT1, which is uniquely able to transport a wide range of different sugars. PfHT1 was captured in an intermediate ``occluded'' state, revealing how the extracellular gating helix TM7b has moved to break and occlude the sugar-binding site. Sequence difference and kinetics indicated that the TM7b gating helix dynamics and interactions likely evolved to enable substrate promiscuity in PfHT1, rather than the sugar-binding site itself. It was unclear, however, if the TM7b structural transitions observed in PfHT1 would be similar in the other GLUT proteins. Here, using enhanced sampling molecular dynamics simulations, we show that the fructose transporter GLUT5 spontaneously transitions through an occluded state that closely resembles PfHT1. Furthermore, we observe that inclusion of fructose lowers the energetic barriers between the outward and inward-facing states, and that its binding is coupled to TM7b gating by a strictly-conserved asparagine residue and a GLUT5-specific tyrosine-histidine pairing. Rather than a substrate binding site that achieves strict specificity by having a high-affinity for the substrate, we conclude GLUT proteins have allosterically coupled sugar binding with an extracellular gate that forms the high-affinity transition-state instead. This substrate-coupling pathway presumably enables the catalysis of fast sugar flux at physiological relevant blood-glucose concentrations. Significance statement Glucose transporters (GLUTs) are responsible for the facilitated transport of glucose into cells, a process that is vital to life. While high resolution structures of GLUTs have been resolved, it has been unclear how sugar binding and translocation are ultimately coupled. Here we have used advanced molecular dynamics simulations to follow the transport cycle of GLUT5, a fructose-specific member of the GLUT family. We reveal the role that sugar plays in recruiting an extracellular gate to from the transition state, providing a molecular basis for how sugars catalyse fast, yet specific, fructose transport.},

  abstract = {Although the like-dissolves-like rule is often invoked to explain why sodium chloride dissolves in water, hidden behind this explanation is the delicate balance between the very large cohesive energy of the ionic crystal and large solvation energies of the ions. Room-temperature ionic liquids (ILs) are liquid analogues of ionic crystals and, as dictated by a similar energetic balance, may either fully mix with water or be immiscible with water depending on ion type and cation/anion combination. In this work, we study three hydrophobic and three hydrophilic ILs to examine whether a priori prediction of water miscibility is possible based on analysis of bulk properties alone. We find that hydrophilic and hydrophobic ILs exhibit distinct signatures in their (reciprocal space) Coulomb interactions that indicate predisposition to water mixing. Hydrophilic ILs exhibit a prominent peak in their electrostatic interactions at 58-length scale, largely due to repulsion between neighboring anion shells. When mixed with water, this peak is significantly reduced in magnitude, indicating that electrostatic screening by water molecules is an important driving force for mixing. In contrast, hydrophobic ILs show no such peak, indicating no predisposition to mixing. In addition to this analysis, we compute and compare solvation free energies of the six different anions in water, ion-pairing free energies at infinitely dilute concentration, and water absorption free energies in the different ILs. Analyzed within the context of empirical data, our calculations suggest that hydrophobicity trends of different ILs are very sensitive to precise water content at dilute conditions. For example, we predict that bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide-based ILs exhibit anomalously large water absorption free energies at zero water content, with increasing hydrophobicity as preferential absorption sites within the IL become saturated.}

We assessed the safety and efficacy of ivacaftor during 96 weeks of PERSIST in patients with cystic fibrosis who completed a previous 48-week, placebo-controlled trial of the drug (STRIVE or ENVISION). Methods: In this phase 3, open-label extension study, patients received ivacaftor 150 mg every 12 h in addition to their prescribed cystic fibrosis therapies. Patients who received placebo in their previous study initiated ivacaftor in this extension study. Patients were eligible if they had a Gly551Asp-CFTR mutation on at least one allele. The primary objective was to assess the long-term safety profile of ivacaftor as assessed by adverse events, clinical laboratory assessments, electrocardiograms, vital signs, and physical examination; secondary measures included change in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), weight, and pulmonary exacerbations. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01117012 and EudraCT, number 2009-012997-11. Findings: Between July 8, 2010, and April 8, 2013, 144 adolescents/adults ({$\geq$}12 years) from STRIVE and 48 children (6-11 years) from ENVISION were enrolled. Across both trials, 38 (20\%) patients had a serious adverse event during the first 48 weeks and 44 (23\%) during the subsequent 48 weeks. Two adults (1\%) and one child ({$<$}1\%) discontinued because of adverse events. The most common adverse events were pulmonary exacerbation, cough, and upper respiratory tract infection. Patients previously treated with ivacaftor had sustained improvements in FEV1, weight, and rate of pulmonary exacerbations for up to 144 weeks of treatment. Among adolescents/adults and children who previously received ivacaftor, absolute change in FEV1 at week 96 (144 weeks ivacaftor) was 9\textperiodcentered 4 and 10\textperiodcentered 3 \% points and absolute increase in weight was 4\textperiodcentered 1 kg and 14\textperiodcentered 8 kg, respectively. For adolescents/adults only, the pulmonary exacerbation rate remained suppressed compared with that of patients who received placebo in the placebo-controlled study. Interpretation: At 144 weeks of treatment, ivacaftor was well tolerated, with no new safety concerns. Ivacaftor also provided durable effects for 144 weeks in patients who had received active treatment in the placebo-controlled study. Those patients who previously received placebo had improvements comparable to those of patients treated with ivacaftor in the placebo-controlled study. Funding: Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc.},

Consideration of both typical range of stabilizing interactions, and folding rates themselves, leads to a model of the energy hypersurface that is characterized by the structure of diffusive "hypergutters" as well as the familiar "funnels". Several general predictions result: 1), intermediate subspaces of configurations will always be visited; 2), specific but nonnative interactions may be important in stabilizing these low-dimensional diffusive searches on the folding pathway, as well as native interactions; 3), sequential barriers will commonly be found, even in "two-state" proteins; 4), very early times will show characteristic departures from single-exponential kinetics; and 5), contributions of nonnative interactions to {$\Phi$}-values and "Chevron plots" are calculable, and may be significant. The example of a three-helix bundle is treated in more detail as an illustration. The model also shows that high-dimensional structures provide conceptual relations between different models of protein folding. It suggests that kinetic strategies for fast folding may be encoded rather generally in nonnative as well as in native interactions. The predictions are related to very recent findings in experiment and simulation.}

The scheme starts from the analysis of the energy-networks responsible for the stabilization of the folded conformation, by means of the energy-decomposition approach. In this framework, the compact energetic map of the native state is generated by a preliminary short molecular dynamics (MD) simulation of the protein in explicit solvent. This map is simplified by means of an eigenvalue decomposition. The highest components of the eigenvector associated with the lowest eigenvalue indicate which sites, named "hot spots", are likely to be responsible for the stability and correct folding of the protein. In the Hamiltonian replica exchange protocol, we use modified force-field parameters to treat the interparticle non-bonded potentials of the hot spots within the protein and between protein and solvent atoms, leaving unperturbed those relative to all other residues, as well as solvent-solvent interactions. We show that it is possible to reversibly simulate the folding/unfolding behavior of two test proteins, namely Villin HeadPiece HP35 (35 residues) and Protein A (62 residues), using a limited number of replicas. We next discuss possible implications for the study of folding mechanisms via all atom simulations. \textcopyright{} 2013 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

  abstract = {The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is responsible for the disease cystic fibrosis (CF). It is a membrane protein belonging to the ABC transporter family functioning as a chloride/anion channel in epithelial cells around the body. There are over 1500 mutations that have been characterised as CF-causing; the most common of these, accounting for \textasciitilde 70 \% of CF cases, is the deletion of a phenylalanine at position 508. This leads to instability of the nascent protein and the modified structure is recognised and then degraded by the ER quality control mechanism. However, even pharmacologically `rescued' F508del CFTR displays instability at the cell's surface, losing its channel function rapidly and it is rapidly removed from the plasma membrane for lysosomal degradation. This review will, therefore, explore the link between stability and structure/function relationships of membrane proteins and CFTR in particular and how approaches to study CFTR structure depend on its stability. We will also review the application of a fluorescence labelling method for the assessment of the thermostability and the tertiary structure of CFTR.},

Mutations in CFTR cause cystic fibrosis, the most common genetic disease in people of European origin. The F508del mutation is found in about 90\% of patients and here we present data that suggest its main effect is on CFTR stability rather than on the three-dimensional (3D) folded state. A survey of recent cryo-electron microscopy studies was carried out and this highlighted differences in terms of CFTR conformation despite similarities in experimental conditions. We further studied CFTR structure under various phosphorylation states and with the CFTR-interacting protein NHERF1. The coexistence of outward-facing and inward-facing conformations under a range of experimental conditions was suggested from these data. These results are discussed in terms of structural models for channel gating, and favour the model where the mostly disordered regulatory-region of the protein acts as a channel plug.},

  abstract = {Spontaneous transitions between the native and non-native protein conformations are normally rare events that hardly take place in typical unbiased molecular dynamics simulations. It was recently demonstrated that such transitions can be well described by a reaction coordinate, Q, that represents the collective fraction of the native contacts between the protein atoms. Here we attempt to use this reaction coordinate to enhance the conformational sampling. We perform umbrella sampling simulations with biasing potentials on Q for two model proteins, Trp-Cage and BBA, using the CHARMM force field. Hamiltonian replica exchange is implemented in these simulations to further facilitate the sampling. The simulations appear to have reached satisfactory convergence, resulting in unbiased free energies as a function of Q. In addition to the native structure, multiple folded conformations are identified in the reconstructed equilibrium ensemble. Some conformations without any native contacts nonetheless have rather compact geometries and are stabilized by hydrogen bonds not present in the native structure. Whereas the enhanced sampling along Q reasonably reproduces the equilibrium conformational space, we also find that the folding of an {$\alpha$}-helix in Trp-Cage is a slow degree of freedom orthogonal to Q and therefore cannot be accelerated by biasing the reaction coordinate. Overall, we conclude that whereas Q is an excellent parameter to analyze the simulations, it is not necessarily a perfect reaction coordinate for enhanced sampling, and better incorporation of other slow degrees of freedom may further improve this reaction coordinate.},

  abstract = {The insulin and IGF-I receptors are members of the superfamily of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs). Unlike most RTKs that are single-chain monomeric transmembrane polypeptides, the insulin and IGF-I receptors are covalent dimers composed of two extracellular {$\alpha$} subunits and two transmembrane {$\beta$} subunits containing the tyrosine kinase domains. The {$\alpha$} subunits contain the ligand binding sites, of which at least three subdomains have been defined by photoaffinity crosslinking, alanine-scanning mutagenesis or minimized receptor constructs. All RTKs are dimeric or oligomeric in the ligand-activated form. The residues of insulin involved in receptor binding have been mapped by alanine-scanning mutagenesis. They form at least two major epitopes that partially overlap with the dimer- and hexamer-forming surfaces of the insulin molecule, and we propose that insulin is using those surfaces to asymmetrically cross-link the two receptor {$\alpha$} subunits. This mechanism provides a structural basis for high affinity binding and negative cooperativity, and probably also operates in the IGF-receptor interaction. It also provides a structural basis for the approximation and transphosphorylation of the kinase domains and triggering of the signalling cascade.},

  abstract = {Calculations of ligand binding free energies and kinetic rates are important for drug design. However, such tasks have proven challenging in computational chemistry and biophysics. To address this challenge, we have developed a new computational method, ligand Gaussian accelerated molecular dynamics (LiGaMD), which selectively boosts the ligand nonbonded interaction potential energy based on the Gaussian accelerated molecular dynamics (GaMD) enhanced sampling technique. Another boost potential could be applied to the remaining potential energy of the entire system in a dual-boost algorithm (LiGaMD\_Dual) to facilitate ligand binding. LiGaMD has been demonstrated on host-guest and protein-ligand binding model systems. Repetitive guest binding and unbinding in the {$\beta$}-cyclodextrin host were observed in hundreds-of-nanosecond LiGaMD\_Dual simulations. The calculated guest binding free energies agreed excellently with experimental data with \textbackslash textless1.0 kcal/mol errors. Compared with converged microsecond-time scale conventional molecular dynamics simulations, the sampling errors of LiGaMD\_Dual simulations were also \textbackslash textless1.0 kcal/mol. Accelerations of ligand kinetic rate constants in LiGaMD simulations were properly estimated using Kramers' rate theory. Furthermore, LiGaMD allowed us to capture repetitive dissociation and binding of the benzamidine inhibitor in trypsin within 1 {$\mu$}s simulations. The calculated ligand binding free energy and kinetic rate constants compared well with the experimental data. In summary, LiGaMD provides a powerful enhanced sampling approach for characterizing ligand binding thermodynamics and kinetics simultaneously, which is expected to facilitate computer-aided drug design.},

We tested different water contents in these ILs at room temperature (298 K) and high temperature (343 K), and we observe that the enzyme structure is highly dependent on the amount of water present in the IL media. We show that the enzyme is preferentially stabilized in [BMIM][PF6] at 5-10\% (w/w) (weight of water over protein) water content at room temperature. [BMIM][PF 6] renders a more nativelike enzyme structure at the same water content of 5-10\% (w/w) as previously found for hexane, and the system displays a similar bell-shape-like dependence with the water content in the IL media. [BMIM][PF6] is shown to increase significantly the protein thermostability at high temperatures, especially at low hydration. Our analysis indicates that the enzyme is less stabilized in [BMIM]-[NO3] relative to [BMIM][PF6] at both temperatures, most likely due to the strong affinity of the [NO3]- anion toward the protein main chain. These findings are in accordance with the experimental knowledge for these two ionic liquids. We also show that these ILs "strip off" most of the water from the enzyme surface in a degree similar to that found for polar organic solvents such as acetonitrile, and that the remaining waters at the enzyme surface are organized in many small clusters. \textcopyright{} 2008 American Chemical Society.}

This paper examines current attribution technology from unclassified literature and finds the technology to be well developed but not foolproof, such that nuclear attribution currently provides little deterrent value. If current capabilities were publicized more thoroughly and if the post-explosion process of assessing the evidence were internationalized, states and intermediate actors might be deterred more effectively.

SELECTION CRITERIA Types of studies: randomized controlled trials TYPES OF PARTICIPANTS adults with a diagnosis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis Types of interventions: treatment with riluzole or placebo Types of outcome measures: Primary: pooled hazard ratio of tracheostomy-free survival over all time points with riluzole 100 mg. Secondary: per cent mortality with riluzole 50 mg, 100 mg and 200 mg; neurologic function, muscle strength and adverse events. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS One author performed data extraction and two other authors checked them. One author checked the data and entered them into the computer. The other authors verified the data entry. We obtained missing data from the trial authors whenever possible. MAIN RESULTS The four trials examining tracheostomy-free survival included a total of 974 riluzole-treated patients and 503 placebo-treated patients. No new randomized controlled trials were found when we updated the searches for this update in 2011. The methodological quality was acceptable and three trials were easily comparable, although one trial (169 participants) included older patients in more advanced stages of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and one (195 participants) had multiple primary endpoints. Riluzole 100 mg per day provided a benefit for the homogeneous group of patients in the first two trials (hazard ratio (HR) 0.80, 95\% confidence internal (CI) 0.64 to 0.99, P= 0.042) and there was no evidence of heterogeneity (P = 0.33). When the third trial (which included older and more seriously affected patients) was added, there was evidence of heterogeneity (P {$<$} 0.0001) and the overall treatment effect was reduced but still significant (HR 0.84, 95\% CI 0.698 to 0.997, P= 0.046). This represented a 9\% gain in the probability of surviving one year (49\% in the placebo and 58\% in the riluzole group), and increased median survival from 11.8 to 14.8 months. There was a small beneficial effect on both bulbar and limb function, but not on muscle strength. A three-fold increase in serum alanine transferase was more frequent in riluzole-treated patients than controls (mean difference 2.62, 95\% CI 1.59 to 4.31). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS Riluzole 100 mg daily is reasonably safe and probably prolongs median survival by about two to three months in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.}

Despite recent progress in structure determination of these transporters, the conformational motion that transduces the energy of ATP hydrolysis to the work of substrate translocation remains undefined. Here, we have investigated the conformational cycle of BmrCD, a representative of the heterodimer family of ABC exporters that have an intrinsically impaired nucleotide binding site. We measured distances between pairs of spin labels monitoring the movement of the nucleotide binding (NBD) and transmembrane domains (TMD). The results expose previously unobserved structural intermediates of the NBDs arising from asymmetric configuration of catalytically inequivalent nucleotide binding sites. The two-state transition of the TMD, from an inward- to an outward-facing conformation, is driven exclusively by ATP hydrolysis. These findings provide direct evidence of divergence in the mechanism of ABC exporters.},

  abstract = {Metadynamics (MTD) is one of the most effective methods for calculating the free energy surface and finding rare events. Nevertheless, numerous studies using MTD have been carried out using 3D or lower dimensional collective variables (CVs), as higher dimensional CVs require costly computational resources and the obtained results are too complex to understand the important events. The latter issue can be conveniently solved by utilizing the free energy reaction network (FERN), which is a graph structure consisting of edges of minimum free energy paths (MFEPs), nodes of equation (EQ) points, and transition state (TS) points. In the present article, a new method for exploring FERNs on high-dimensional CVs using MTD and the scaled hypersphere search (SHS) method is described. A test calculation based on the MTD-SHS simulation of met-enkephalin in explicit water with 7 CVs was conducted. As a result, 889 EQ points and 1805 TS points were found. The MTD-SHS approach can find MFEPs exhaustively; therefore, the FERNs can be estimated without any a priori knowledge of the EQ and TS points.},

  abstract = {Chemical denaturants are frequently used to unfold proteins and to characterize mechanisms and transition states of protein folding reactions. The molecular basis of the effect of urea and guanidinium chloride (GdmCl) on polypeptide chains is still not well understood. Models for denaturant-protein interaction include both direct binding and indirect changes in solvent properties. Here we report studies on the effect of urea and GdmCl on the rate constants (kc) of end-to-end diffusion in unstructured poly(glycine-serine) chains of different length. Urea and GdmCl both lead to a linear decrease of ln kc with denaturant concentration, as observed for the rate constants for protein folding. This suggests that the effect of denaturants on chain dynamics significantly contributes to the denaturant-dependence of folding rate constants for small proteins. We show that this linear dependency is the result of two additive non-linear effects, namely increased solvent viscosity and denaturant binding. The contribution from denaturant binding can be quantitatively described by Schellman's weak binding model with binding constants (K) of 0.62({$\pm$}0.01) M-1 for GdmCl and 0.26({$\pm$}0.01) M-1 for urea. In our model peptides the number of binding sites and the effect of a bound denaturant molecule on chain dynamics is identical for urea and GdmCl. The results further identify the polypeptide backbone as the major denaturant binding site and give an upper limit of a few nanoseconds for residence times of denaturant molecules on the polypeptide chain. \textcopyright{} 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Mutations have yet to be analyzed in aggregate to assess their distribution across the tertiary structure of the CFTR protein, an approach that could provide valuable insights into the structure-function relationship of CFTR. In addition, the binding site of Class I correctors (VX-809, VX-661, and C18) is not well understood. In this study, exonic CFTR mutations and mutant allele frequencies described in 3 curated databases (ABCMdb, CFTR1, and CFTR2, comprising {$>$}130 000 data points) were mapped to 2 different structural models: a homology model of full-length CFTR protein in the open-channel state, and a cryo-electron microscopy core-structure of CFTR in the closed-channel state. Accordingly, residue positions of 6 high-frequency mutant CFTR alleles were found to spatially co-localize in CFTR protein, and a significant cluster was identified at the NBD1:ICL4 interdomain interface. In addition, immunoblotting confirmed the approximate binding site of Class I correctors, demonstrating that these small molecules act via a similar mechanism in vitro, and in silico molecular docking generated binding poses for their complex with the cryo-electron microscopy structure to suggest the putative corrector binding site is a multi-domain pocket near residues F374-L375. These results confirm the significance of interdomain interfaces as susceptible to disruptive mutation, and identify a putative corrector binding site. The structural pharmacogenomics approach of mapping mutation databases to protein models shows promise for facilitating drug discovery and personalized medicine for monogenetic diseases.},

  abstract = {Deep eutectic solvents (DESs) are utilized as green and inexpensive alternatives to classical ionic liquids. It has been known that some of DESs can be used as solvent in the enzymatic reactions to obtain very green chemical processes. DESs are quite poorly understood at the molecular level. Moreover, we do not know much about the enzyme microstructure in such systems. For example, how some hydrolase can remain active and stable in a deep eutectic solvent including 9 M of urea? In this study, the molecular dynamics of DESs as a liquid was simulated at the molecular level. Urea:choline chloride as a well-known eutectic mixture was chosen as a model DES. The behavior of the lipase as a biocatalyst was studied in this system. For comparison, the enzyme structure was also simulated in 8M urea. The thermal stability of the enzyme was also evaluated in DESs, water, and 8M urea. The enzyme showed very good conformational stability in the urea:choline chloride mixture with about 66\% urea (9 M) even at high temperatures. The results are in good agreement with recent experimental observations. In contrast, complete enzyme denaturation occurred in 8M urea with only 12\% urea in water. It was found that urea molecules denature the enzyme by interrupting the intra-chain hydrogen bonds in a "direct denaturation mechanism". However, in a urea:choline chloride deep eutectic solvent, as a result of hydrogen bonding with choline and chloride ions, urea molecules have a low diffusion coefficient and cannot reach the protein domains. Interestingly, urea, choline, and chloride ions form hydrogen bonds with the surface residues of the enzyme which, instead of lipase denaturation, leads to greater enzyme stability. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study in which the microstructural properties of a macromolecule are examined in a deep eutectic solvent. \textcopyright{} the Partner Organisations 2014.}

Results of coarse-grained Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations of non-grafted vWF multimers subject to a shearing flow were used as input variables to a Random Forest Algorithm (RFA). Twenty unique features characterizing macromolecular conformation information of vWF multimers were used for training the RFA. The corresponding responses classify instantaneous A2 domain state as either folded or unfolded, and were directly taken from coarse-grained MD simulations. Three separate RFAs were trained using feature/response data of varying resolution, which provided deep insights into the highly correlated macromolecular dynamics occurring in concert with A2 domain unfolding events. The algorithm is used to analyze results of simulation, but has been developed for use with experimental data as well.},

This review gives an overview about the some of the most important possible analyses, technical challenges, and existing protocols that can be performed on the biological membrane by molecular dynamics simulation. The reviewed analyses include the degree of membrane disruption, average area per lipid, probability distributions for the area per lipid molecule, membrane thickness, membrane area compressibility, lateral diffusion, rotational diffusion, order parameters, head group tilt, electron density profile, mass density profile, electrostatic potential profile, ordering of vicinity waters, number of hydrogen bonds, and radial distribution function.}

Modification of apparent KD of CFTR activators by mutations of the nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs) suggests that the binding site might be in these regions. The human NBD structure was predicted by homology with murine NBD1. An NBD1-NBD2 complex was constructed by overlying monomers to a bacterial ABC transporter NBD dimer in the `head-to- tail' conformation. Binding sites for CFTR activators were predicted by molecular docking. Comparison of theoretical binding free energy estimated in the model to free energy estimated from the apparent dissociation constants, KD, resulted in a remarkably good correlation coefficient for one of the putative binding sites, located in the interface between NBD1 and NBD2.},

  abstract = {Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), involved in cystic fibrosis (CF), is a chloride channel belonging to the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) superfamily. Using the experimental structure of Sav1866 as template, we previously modeled the human CFTR structure, including membrane-spanning domains (MSD) and nucleotide-binding domains (NBD), in an outward-facing conformation (open channel state). Here, we constructed a model of the CFTR inward-facing conformation (closed channel) on the basis of the recent corrected structures of MsbA and compared the structural features of those two states of the channel. Interestingly, the MSD:NBD coupling interfaces including F508 ({$\Delta$}F508 being the most common CF mutation) are mainly left unchanged. This prediction, completed by the modeling of the regulatory R domain, is supported by experimental data and provides a molecular basis for a better understanding of the functioning of CFTR, especially of the structural features that make CFTR the unique channel among the ABC transporters. \textcopyright{} 2009 Birkh\"auser Verlag, Basel/Switzerland.},

Until now, these models, however, did not furnished much insights into the continuous way that ions could follow from the cytosol to the extracellular milieu in the open form of the channel. Here, we have built a refined model of CFTR, based on the outward-facing Sav1866 experimental 3D structure and integrating the evolutionary and structural information available today. Molecular dynamics simulations revealed significant conformational changes, resulting in a full-open channel, accessible from the cytosol through lateral tunnels displayed in the long intracellular loops (ICLs). At the same time, the region of nucleotide-binding domain 1 in contact with one of the ICLs and carrying amino acid F508, the deletion of which is the most common CF-causing mutation, was found to adopt an alternative but stable position. Then, in a second step, this first stable full-open conformation evolved toward another stable state, in which only a limited displacement of the upper part of the transmembrane helices leads to a closure of the channel, in a conformation very close to that adopted by the Atm1 ABC exporter, in an inward-facing conformation. These models, supported by experimental data, provide significant new insights into the CFTR structure-function relationships and into the possible impact of CF-causing mutations.},

The expression explicitly states the RDF as a continuous function of reduced interparticle distance, temperature, and density. It satisfies the limiting conditions of zero density and infinite distance imposed by statistical thermodynamics. The distance dependence of this expression is expressed by an equation which contains 11 adjustable parameters. These parameters are fitted to 353 RDF data, obtained by molecular dynamics calculations, and then expressed as functions of reduced distance, temperature and density. This expression, having a total of 65 constants, reproduces the RDF data with an average root-mean-squared deviation of 0.0152 for the range of state variables of 0.5{$\leqslant$}T{${_\ast}\leqslant$}5.1 and 0.35{$\leqslant\rho{_\ast}\leqslant$}1.1 (T{${_\ast}$}=kT/{$\epsilon$} and {$\rho{_\ast}$}={$\rho\sigma$}3 are reduced temperature and density, respectively).

Although these are well-established theories in macroscopic situations, it is not clear from the outset that they should work in small systems whose dimensions are comparable to or smaller than the Debye length. Here, we test the validity of the mean-field approximation in Poisson-Boltzmann theory by comparing its predictions with those of Brownian dynamics simulations. For this purpose we use spherical and cylindrical boundaries and a catenary shape similar to that of the acetylcholine receptor channel. The interior region filled with electrolyte is assumed to have a high dielectric constant, and the exterior region representing protein a low one. Comparisons of the force on a test ion obtained with the two methods show that the shielding effect due to counterions is overestimated in Poisson-Boltzmann theory when the ion is within a Debye length of the boundary. As the ion gets closer to the boundary, the discrepancy in force grows rapidly. The implication for membrane channels, whose radii are typically smaller than the Debye length, is that Poisson-Boltzmann theory cannot be used to obtain reliable estimates of the electrostatic potential energy and force on an ion in the channel environment.},

However, the motifs that localize CFTR to the apical membrane are unknown. We report that the last 3 amino acids in the COOH-terminus of CFTR (T-R-L) comprise a PDZ-interacting domain that is required for the polarization of CFTR to the apical plasma membrane in human airway and kidney epithelial cells. In addition, the CFTR mutant, S1455X, which lacks the 26 COOH-terminal amino acids, including the PDZ-interacting domain, is mispolarized to the lateral membrane. We also demonstrate that CFTR binds to ezrin-radixin-moesin-binding phosphoprotein 50 (EBP50), an apical membrane PDZ domain containing protein. We propose that COOH-terminal deletions of CFTR, which represent about 10\% of CFTR mutations, result in defective vectorial chloride transport, partly by altering the polarized distribution of CFTR in epithelial cells. Moreover, our data demonstrate that PDZ-interacting domains and PDZ domain-containing proteins play a key role in the apical polarization of ion channels in epithelial cells.}

Most superfamily members are transporters, while cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), alone, is an ion channel. Despite this functional difference, recent results have suggested that CFTR shares a common molecular mechanism with other members. ATP binds to partial binding sites on the surface of the two NBDs, which then associate to form a NBD dimer, with complete composite catalytic sites now buried at the interface. ATP hydrolysis and {$\gamma$}-phosphate dissociation, with the loss of molecular contacts linking the two sides of the composite site, trigger dimer dissociation. The conformational signals generated by NBD dimer formation and dissociation are transmitted to the transmembrane domains where, in transporters, they drive the cycle of conformational changes that translocate the substrate across the membrane; in CFTR, they result in opening and closing (gating) of the ion-permeation pathway.},

Characterization of these functionally important lipid-protein interactions with experimental techniques is however still prohibitively challenging. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations offer a powerful complementary approach with sufficient temporal and spatial resolutions to gain atomic-level structural information and energetics on lipid-protein interactions. In this review, we aim to provide a broad survey of MD simulations focusing on exploring lipid-protein interactions and characterizing lipid-modulated protein structure and dynamics that have been successful in providing novel insight into the mechanism of membrane protein function.}

In this work, we have investigated the possibility of using a selected deep eutectic solvent (DES) for the liquid-liquid extraction of benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and m-xylene (BTEX) aromatics. The DES used in this work was synthesized by combining tetrabutylammonium salt and sulfolane. Equilibrium data for the ternary system consisting of BTEX aromatics, n-octane and DES were measured at 25 \textdegree C and atmospheric pressure. The results showed that the used DESs have comparable distribution ratios and selectivities to those of commercial solvents. In all tested systems, sulfolane was not present in the hydrocarbon layer. It was also found that the selectivity decreases with decreasing polarity of the aromatic compound. The Non-Random Two Liquid (NRTL) model was successfully used to correlate the experimental tie-lines and to calculate the phase compositions of the ternary systems. In addition, the performance of COSMO-RS to predict the ternary tie-lines for the studied systems was evaluated and the {$\sigma$}-profiles were used to explain the interaction between the DES and the aromatic compounds.

Many structural methods are reviewed including modern liquid crystallography of lipid bilayers that deals with the fully developed undulation fluctuations that occur in the L({$\alpha$}) phase. These fluctuations degrade the higher order diffraction data in a way that, if unrecognized, leads to erroneous conclusions regarding bilayer structure. Diffraction measurements at high instrumental resolution provide a measure of these fluctuations. In addition to providing better structural determination, this opens a new window on interactions between bilayers, so the experimental determination of interbilayer interaction parameters is reviewed briefly. We introduce a new structural correction based on fluctuations that has not been included in any previous studies. Updated measurements, such as for the area compressibility modulus, are used to provide adjustments to many of the literature values of structural quantities. Since the gel (L({$\beta$})') phase is valuable as a stepping stone for obtaining fluid phase results, a brief review is given of the lower temperature phases. The uncertainty in structural results for lipid bilayers is being reduced and best current values are provided for bilayers of five lipids. Copyright (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.},

Here we report that syntaxin 1A inhibits CFTR chloride channels by means of direct and domain-specific protein-protein interactions. Syntaxin 1A stoichiometrically binds to the N-terminal cytoplasmic tail of CFTR, and this binding is blocked by Munc-18. The modulation of CFTR currents by syntaxin 1A is eliminated either by deletion of this tail or by injecting this tail as a blocking peptide into coexpressing Xenopus oocytes. The CFTR binding site on syntaxin 1A maps to the third predicted helical domain (H3) of this membrane protein. Moreover, CFTR Cl- currents are effectively inhibited by a minimal syntaxin 1A construct (i.e., the membrane-anchored H3 domain) that cannot fully substitute for wild-type syntaxin 1A in membrane fusion reactions. We also show that syntaxin 1A binds to and inhibits the activities of disease- associated mutants of CFTR, and that the chloride current activity of recombinant {$\Delta$}F508 CFTR (i.e., the most common cystic fibrosis mutant) can be potentiated by disrupting its interaction with syntaxin 1A in cultured epithelial cells. Our results provide evidence for a direct physical interaction between CFTR and syntaxin 1A that limits the functional activities of normal and disease-associated forms of this chloride channel.},

  abstract = {Understanding the energetics of peripheral protein-membrane interactions is important to many areas of biophysical chemistry and cell biology. Estimating free-energy landscapes by molecular dynamics (MD) simulation is challenging for such systems, especially when membrane recognition involves complex lipids, e.g., phosphatidylinositol phosphates (PIPs). We combined coarse-grained MD simulations with umbrella sampling to quantify the binding of the well-explored GRP1 pleckstrin homology (PH) domain to model membranes containing PIP molecules. The experimentally observed preference of GRP1-PH for PIP3 over PIP2 was reproduced. Mutation of a key residue (K273A) within the canonical PIP-binding site significantly reduced the free energy of PIP binding. The presence of a noncanonical PIP-interaction site, observed experimentally in other PH domains but not previously in GRP1-PH, was also revealed. These studies demonstrate how combining coarse-grained simulations and umbrella sampling can unmask the molecular basis of the energetics of interactions between peripheral membrane proteins and complex cellular membranes.}

Proper shuttling between the nucleus and cytoplasm is essential for physiological cell function. However, the initial event in the pathophysiology of FUS-ALS remains enigmatic. Using human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSCs)-derived motor neurons (MNs), we show that impairment of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP)-dependent DNA damage response (DDR) signaling due to mutations in the FUS nuclear localization sequence (NLS) induces additional cytoplasmic FUS mislocalization which in turn results in neurodegeneration and FUS aggregate formation. Our work suggests that a key pathophysiologic event in ALS is upstream of aggregate formation. Targeting DDR signaling could lead to novel therapeutic routes for ameliorating ALS.},

A quantitative understanding of the relationship would facilitate more systematic procedures for manipulating the properties in a process environment. In this work the molecular basis for the osmotic second virial coefficient, B22, is studied; osmotic effects are critical in membrane transport, and the value of B22 has also been shown to correlate with protein crystallization behavior. The calculations here account for steric, electrostatic, and short-range interactions, with the structural and functional anisotropy of the protein molecules explicitly accounted for. The orientational dependence of the protein interactions is seen to have a pronounced effect on the calculations; in particular, the relatively few protein-protein configurations in which the apposing surfaces display geometric complementarity contribute disproportionately strongly to B22. The importance of electrostatic interactions is also amplified in these high- complementarity configurations. The significance of molecular recognition in determining B22 can explain the correlation with crystallization behavior, and it suggests that alteration of local molecular geometry can help in manipulating protein solution behavior. The results also have implications for the role of protein interactions in biological self-organization.}

Experimental measurements of the second virial coefficient of lysozyme and bovine {$\alpha$}-chymotrypsinogen A were performed by static light scattering, as a function of pH and electrolyte concentration. Although some of the trends can be explained qualitatively by simple colloidal models of protein interactions, a more realistic interpretation based on protein crystallographic structures suggests a different explanation of experimental trends. The interactions accounted for are solute-solute excluded volume (steric), electrostatic and short-range (mainly van der Waals) interactions. The interactions depend strongly on orientation, and this profoundly affects calculated second virial coefficients. We find that molecular configurations in which complementary surfaces are apposed contribute disproportionately to the second virial coefficient, mainly through short-range interactions; electrostatic interactions play a secondary role in many of these configurations. Thus molecular recognition events can play a role in determining the solution thermodynamic properties of proteins, and this provides a plausible basis for explaining the observed relationship with crystallization behavior. \textcopyright{} 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

These substances likely target key conformational changes occurring during channel opening and closing, however, the molecular bases of these conformational changes, and their susceptibility to manipulation are poorly understood. We have used patch clamp recording to identify changes in the three-dimensional organization of the extracellularly accessible parts of the CFTR protein during channel opening and closing. State-dependent formation of both disulfide bonds and Cd2+ bridges occurred for pairs of cysteine side-chains introduced into the extreme extracellular ends of transmembrane helices (TMs) 1, 6, and 12. Between each of these three TMs, we found that both disulfide bonds and metal bridges formed preferentially or exclusively in the closed state and that these inter-TM cross-links stabilized the closed state. These results indicate that the extracellular ends of these TMs are close together when the channel is closed and that they separate from each other when the channel opens. These findings identify for the first time key conformational changes in the extracellular parts of the CFTR protein that can potentially be manipulated to control channel activity.},

One surprising aspect of these structures was the finding that the eighth of CFTR's 12 membrane-spanning segments (TM8) appeared close to the channel pore. Although functional evidence supports a role for other TMs in forming the pore, such a role for TM8 has not previously been reported. Here, we use patch-clamp recording to investigate the functional role of TM8. Using substituted cysteine accessibility mutagenesis, we find that three amino acid side-chains in TM8 (Y913, Y914, and Y917) are exposed to the extracellular, but not the intracellular, solution. Cysteine cross-linking experiments suggest that Y914 and Y917 are in close proximity to L102 (TM1) and F337 (TM6), respectively, suggesting that TM8 contributes to the narrow selectivity filter region of the pore. Different amino acid substitutions suggest that Y914, and to a lesser extent Y917, play important roles in controlling anion flux through the open channel. Furthermore, substitutions that reduce side-chain volume at Y917 severely affect channel gating, resulting in a channel with an extremely unstable open state. Our results suggest that pore-lining TM8 is among the most important TMs controlling the permeation phenotype of the CFTR channel, and also that movement of TM8 may be critically involved in channel gating.},

While translation of phage therapy into standard care for CF has been explored, challenges such as the lack of an appropriate animal model demonstrating safety in vivo exist. In this review, we have discussed and provided some insights in the use of primary airway epithelial cells to represent the mucoenvironment of the CF lungs to demonstrate safety and efficacy of phage therapy. The combination of phage therapy and antimicrobials is gaining attention and has the potential to delay the onset of MDR infections. It is evident that efforts to translate phage therapy into standard clinical practice have gained traction in the past 5 years. Ultimately, collaboration, transparency in data publications and standardized policies are needed for clinical translation.}

An important factor to reach this goal is induced electronic polarization, which is likely to impact the permeation rate of small ions through narrow molecular pores. In this work, we extended the recently developed polarizable force field based on the classical Drude oscillators to assess the role of induced polarization effects on the energetics of sodium and potassium ion transport across the gramicidin A (gA) ion channel. The inclusion of induced polarization lowers barriers present in 1D potential of mean force (PMF) for cation permeation by {$\sim$}50\% compared to those obtained with the additive force field. Conductance properties calculated with 1D PMFs from Drude simulations are in better agreement with experimental results. Polarization of single-file water molecules and protein atoms forming the narrow pore has a direct impact on the free-energy barriers and cation-specific solid-state NMR chemical shifts. Sensitivity analysis indicates that small changes to water\textendash channel interactions can alter the free energy barrier for ion permeation. These results, illustrating polarization effects present in the complex electrostatic environment of the gA channel, have broad implications for revising proposed mechanisms of ion permeation and selectivity in a variety of ion channels.}

To this end, a variational principle is derived that is based on the maximization of a Rayleigh coefficient. It is shown that this Rayleigh coefficient can be estimated from statistical observables that can be obtained from short distributed simulations starting from different parts of state space. The approach forms a basis for the development of adaptive and efficient computational algorithms for simulating and analyzing metastable Markov processes while avoiding the sampling problem. Since any stochastic process with finite memory can be transformed into a Markov process, the approach is applicable to a wide range of processes relevant for modeling complex real-world phenomena. \textcopyright{} 2013 Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics.},

Side-chain orientations assayed by cysteine scanning were found to be from 77\% to 90\% in accord with model predictions. The predicted geometry of the anion conduction path was defined by a space-filling model of the pore and confirmed by visualizing the distribution of water molecules from a molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. Pore shape is that of an asymmetric hour glass, comprising a shallow outward-facing vestibule that tapers rapidly toward a narrow ``bottleneck'' linking the outer vestibule to a large inner cavity extending toward the cytoplasmic extent of the lipid bilayer. The junction between the outer vestibule and the bottleneck features an outward\textendash facing rim marked by T338 in TM6 and I1131 in TM12, consistent with the observation that cysteines at both of these locations reacted with both channel-permeant and channel-impermeant, thiol-directed reagents. Conversely, cysteines substituted for S341 in TM6 or T1134 in TM12, predicted by the model to lie below the rim of the bottleneck, were found to react exclusively with channel-permeant reagents applied from the extracellular side. The predicted dimensions of the bottleneck are consistent with the demonstrated permeation of Cl- pseudohalide anions, water and urea.},

  abstract = {Potassium channels are tetrameric membrane-spanning proteins that provide a selective pore for the conduction of K+ across the cell membranes. One of the main physiological functions of potassium channels is efficient and very selective transport of K+ ions through the membrane to the cell. Classical views of ion selectivity are summarized within a historical perspective, and contrasted with the molecular dynamics (MD) simulations free energy perturbation (FEP) performed on the basis of the crystallographic structure of the KcsA phospholipid membrane. The results show that the KcsA channel does not select for K+ ions by providing a binding site of an appropriate (fixed) cavity size. Rather, selectivity for K+ arises directly from the intrinsic local physical properties of the ligands coordinating the cation in the binding site, and is a robust feature of a pore symmetrically lined by backbone carbonyl groups. Further analysis reveals that it is the interplay between the attractive ion\textendash ligand (favoring smaller cation) and repulsive ligand\textendash ligand interactions (favoring larger cations) that is the basic element governing Na+/K+ selectivity in flexible protein binding sites. Because the number and the type of ligands coordinating an ion directly modulate such local interactions, this provides a potent molecular mechanism to achieve and maintain a high selectivity in protein binding sites despite a significant conformational flexibility.},

Owing to the complex function and regulation of this family of ion channels, it is common practice to complement experimental findings with the atomistic description provided by computational approaches such as molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, especially, in light of the unprecedented timescales accessible at present. However, despite recent substantial improvements, the accuracy of MD simulations is still undermined by the intrinsic limitations of force fields. Here, we systematically assessed the performance of the most popular force fields employed to study ion channels at timescales that are orders of magnitude greater than the ones accessible when these energy functions were first developed. Using 32 {$\mu$}s of trajectories, we investigated the dynamics of a member of the K2P ion channel family, the TRAAK channel, using two established force fields in simulations of biological systems: AMBER and CHARMM. We found that while results are comparable on the nanosecond timescales, significant inconsistencies arise at microsecond timescales.},

VX-809, a promising investigational corrector of {$\Delta$}F508-CFTR misprocessing, has limited clinical benefit and an incompletely understood mechanism, hampering drug development. Given the effect of second-site suppressor mutations, robust {$\Delta$}F508-CFTR correction most likely requires stabilization of NBD1 energetics and the interface between membrane-spanning domains (MSDs) and NBD1, which are both established primary conformational defects. Here we elucidate the molecular targets of available correctors: class I stabilizes the NBD1-MSD1 and NBD1-MSD2 interfaces, and class II targets NBD2. Only chemical chaperones, surrogates of class III correctors, stabilize human {$\Delta$}F508-NBD1. Although VX-809 can correct missense mutations primarily destabilizing the NBD1-MSD1/2 interface, functional plasma membrane expression of {$\Delta$}F508-CFTR also requires compounds that counteract the NBD1 and NBD2 stability defects in cystic fibrosis bronchial epithelial cells and intestinal organoids. Thus, the combination of structure-guided correctors represents an effective approach for cystic fibrosis therapy \textcopyright{} 2013 Nature America, Inc.},

The virtual interaction sites (VIS) method replaces hydrogen atoms by massless virtual interaction sites to eliminate these degrees of freedom while keeping intact nonbonded interactions and the explicit treatment of hydrogen atoms. We have modified the existing VIS algorithm for most lipids in the popular CHARMM36 force field by increasing the hydrogen atom masses at regular intervals in the lipid acyl chains and obtained lipid properties and pore formation free energies in very good agreement with those calculated in simulations without VIS. Our modified VIS scheme enables a 5 fs time step resulting in a significant performance gain for all-atom simulations of membranes. The method has the potential to make longer time and length scales accessible in all-atom simulations of membrane-protein complexes.},

(PDBid 3G5U) has been examined under different environmental conditions using molecular dynamics. We show that in the presence of the detergent cholate, the structure of P-glycoprotein solved at pH 7.5 is stable. However, when incorporated into a cholesterol-enriched POPC membrane in the presence of 150 mM NaCl, the structure rapidly deforms. Only when the simulation conditions closely matched the experimental conditions under which P-glycoprotein is transport active was a stable conformation obtained. Specifically, the presence of Mg 2+, which bound to distinct sites in the nucleotide binding domains (NBDs), and the double protonation of the catalytic histidines (His583 and His1228) and His149 were required. While the structure obtained in a membrane environment under these conditions is very similar to the crystal structure of Aller et al., there are several key differences. The NBDs are in direct contact, reminiscent of the open state of MalK. The angle between the transmembrane domains is also increased, resulting in an outward motion of the intracellular loops. Notably, the structures obtained from the simulations provide a better match to a range of experimental cross-linking data than does the original 3G5U-a crystal structure. This work highlights the effect small changes in environmental conditions can have of the conformation of a membrane protein and the importance of representing the experimental conditions appropriately in modeling studies. \textcopyright{} 2012 American Chemical Society.}

Recent experimental and simulation results highlight the potential benefits of dilute ILs in aqueous solution (aqueous ILs) in order to modify protein and DNA structures systematically.

In this review article, we highlight common principles and differences between aqueous ILs and standard co-solutes with a specific focus on their underlying macromolecular stabilization or destabilization behavior. In combination with statistical thermodynamics theories, we present an efficient framework, which is used to classify structure modification effects consistently. The crucial importance of enthalpic and entropic contributions to the free energy change upon IL-assisted macromolecular unfolding in combination with a complex destabilization mechanism is described in detail. A special focus is also set on aqueous IL-DNA interactions, for which experimental and simulation outcomes are summarized and discussed in the context of previous findings.},

Modelling them as elastic networks in a hybrid elastic-network Brownian dynamics simulation (eBDIMS), we generate trajectories connecting stable end-states that spontaneously sample the crystallographic motions, predicting the structures of known intermediates along the paths. We also show that the explored non-linear routes can delimit the lowest energy passages between end-states sampled by atomistic molecular dynamics.

REUS enhances the sampling along predefined reaction coordinates, while GaMD accelerates the conformational dynamics by adding a boost potential to the system energy. The method, which we call GaREUS (Gaussian accelerated replica-exchange umbrella sampling), enhances the sampling more efficiently than REUS or GaMD, while the computational resource for GaREUS is the same as that required for REUS. The two-step reweighting procedure using the multistate Bennett acceptance ratio method and the cumulant expansion for the exponential average is applied to the simulation trajectories for obtaining the unbiased free-energy landscapes. We apply GaREUS to the calculations of free-energy landscapes for three different cases: conformational equilibria of N-glycan, folding of chignolin, and conformational change of adenyl kinase. We show that GaREUS speeds up the convergences of free-energy calculations using the same amount of computational resources as REUS. The free-energy landscapes reweighted from the trajectories of GaREUS agree with previously reported ones. GaREUS is applicable to free-energy calculations of various biomolecular dynamics and functions with reasonable computational costs.}

The {$\Delta$}F508 compromises the folding energetics of the NBD1, as well as the folding of three other CFTR domains. Combination of FDA approved corrector molecules can efficiently but incompletely rescue the {$\Delta$}F508-CFTR folding and stability defect. Thus, new pharmacophores that would reinstate the wild-type-like conformational stability of the {$\Delta$}F508-NBD1 would be highly beneficial. The most prominent molecule, 5-bromoindole-3-acetic acid (BIA) that can thermally stabilize the NBD1 has low potency and efficacy. To gain insights into the NBD1 (un)folding dynamics and BIA binding site localization, we combined molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, atomic force spectroscopy (AFM) and hydrogen-deuterium exchange (HDX) experiments. We found that the NBD1 {$\alpha$}-subdomain with three adjacent strands from the {$\beta$}-subdomain plays an important role in early folding steps, when crucial non-native interactions are formed via residue F508.

Clinical trial data show that individuals taking CFTR-modulators have increased or stable lung function (FEV                 1                 ) as well as reduced frequency of pulmonary exacerbations. There are no data on whether CFTR-modulators influence psychosocial aspects of the lives of individuals with CF. The purpose of this qualitative study was to explore how the introduction of CFTR-modulators has affected individuals' lived experiences outside of clinical health variables; that is, to explore whether there is a relationship between using CFTR-modulator drugs and the psychological and social aspects of the lives of individuals with CF, including: career, relationships, family planning and psychological functioning.                                                        Methods               Eight men and women with CF ages 24\textendash 32, with a history of taking any approved CFTR-modulator for at least six months, were recruited from an adult CF center. A semi-structured interview guide was used to interview the participants. The data were coded using a grounded theory approach with an iterative methodology.

Conclusions               Although these themes cannot be generalized to all individuals with CF, this study provides preliminary data for how CFTR-modulators may influence an individual with CF's outlook on life and that these individuals are feeling hopeful about the future.},

Understanding molecular aggregation processes within DESs will not only enhance the application potential of these solvents but also help alleviate some of the limitations associated with them. Among DESs, those comprising choline chloride and appropriate hydrogen-bond donors are inexpensive and easy to prepare. On the basis of fluorescence probe, electrical conductivity, and surface tension experiments, we present the first clear lines of evidence for self-aggregation of an anionic surfactant within a DES containing a small fraction of water. Namely, well-defined assemblies of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) apparently form in the archetype DES Reline comprising a 1:2 molar mixture of choline chloride and urea. Significant enhancement in the solubility of organic solvents that are otherwise not miscible in choline chloride-based DESs is achieved within Reline in the presence of SDS. The remarkably improved solubility of cyclohexane within SDS-added Reline is attributed to the presence of spontaneously formed cyclohexane-in-Reline microemulsions by SDS under ambient conditions. Surface tension, dynamic light scattering (DLS), small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), density, and dynamic viscosity measurements along with responses from the fluorescence dipolarity and microfluidity probes of pyrene and 1,3-bis(1-pyrenyl)propane are employed to characterize these aggregates. Such water-free oil-in-DES microemulsions are appropriately sized to be considered as a new type of nanoreactor.}

Phys. 2006, 125, 024106), is conceptually simple and straightforward to implement. It consists of refining a putative transition path in the multidimensional space supported by a set of collective variables using the average dynamic drift of those variables. This drift is estimated on-the-fly via swarms of short unbiased trajectories started at different points along the path. Successive iterations of this algorithm, which can be naturally distributed over many computer nodes with negligible interprocessor communication, refine an initial trial path toward the most probable transition path (MPTP) between two stable basins. The method is first tested by determining the pathway for the C7eq to C7ax transition in an all-atom model of the alanine dipeptide in vacuum, which has been studied previously with the string method in collective variables. A transition path is found with a committor distribution peaked at 1/2 near the free energy maximum, in accord with previous results. Last, the method is applied to the allosteric conformational change in the nitrogen regulatory protein C (NtrC), represented here with a two-state elastic network model. Even though more than 550 collective variables are used to describe the conformational change, the path converges rapidly. Again, the committor distribution is found to be peaked around 1/2 near the free energy maximum between the two stable states, confirming that a genuine transition state has been localized in this complex multidimensional system.},

  abstract = {Developing and characterizing green solvents with low toxicity and cost is one of the most important issues in chemistry. Deep Eutectic Solvents (DESs), in this regard, have shown tremendous promise. Compared to popular organic solvents, DESs possess negligible VOCs and are non-flammable. Compared to ionic liquids, which share many characteristics but are ionic compounds and not ionic mixtures, DESs are cheaper to make, much less toxic and mostly biodegradable. An estimate of the polarity associated with DESs is essential if they are to be used as green alternatives to common organic solvents in industries and academia. As no one physical parameter can satisfactorily represent solute-solvent interactions within a medium, polarity of DESs is assessed through solvatochromic optical spectroscopic responses of several UV-vis absorbance and molecular fluorescence probes. Information on the local microenvironment (i.e., the cybotactic region) that surrounds several solvatochromic probes [betaine dye, pyrene, pyrene-1-carboxaldehyde, 1-anilino-8-naphthalene sulfonate (ANS), p-toluidinyl-6-naphthalene sulfonate (TNS), 6-propionyl-2-(dimethylaminonaphthalene) (PRODAN), coumarin-153, and Nile Red] for four common and popular DESs formed from choline chloride combined with 1,2-ethanediol, glycerol, urea, and malonic acid, respectively, in 1 : 2 molar ratios termed ethaline, glyceline, reline, and maline is obtained and used to assess the effective polarity afforded by each of these DESs. The four DESs as indicated by these probe responses are found to be fairly dipolar in nature. Absorbance probe betaine dye and fluorescence probes ANS, TNS, PRODAN, coumarin-153, and Nile Red, whose solvatochromic responses are based on photoinduced charge-transfer, imply ethaline and glyceline, DESs formed using alcohol-based H-bond donors, to be relatively more dipolar in nature as compared to reline and maline. The pyrene polarity scale, which is based on polarity-induced changes in vibronic bands, indicates reline, the DES composed of urea as the hydrogen bond donor, to be significantly more dipolar than the other three DESs. Response of pyrene-1-carboxaldehyde, a polarity probe based on inversion of n-{$\pi$}* and {$\pi$}-{$\pi$}* states, hints at maline to be the most dipolar of the four DESs. The molecular structure of the H-bond donor in a DES clearly controls the dipolarity afforded by the DES. H-bonding and other specific solute-solvent interactions are found to play an important role in solvatochromic probe behavior for the four DESs. The cybotactic region of a probe dissolved in a DES affords information on the polarity of the DES towards solutes of similar nature and functionality.}

Many common and popular DESs are obtained by simply mixing a salt and a H-bond donor. Properties of such a DES depend on its constituents. Change in temperature and addition of water, a benign cosolvent, can change the physicochemical properties of DESs. The effect of changing temperature and addition of water on solvatochromic probe behavior within three DESs formed from choline chloride combined with 1,2-ethanediol, glycerol, and urea, respectively, in 1:2 mol ratios termed ethaline, glyceline, and reline is presented. Increase in temperature results in reduced H-bond donating acidity of the DESs. Dipolarity/polarizability and H-bond accepting basicity do not change with changing temperature of the DESs. The response of the fluorescence probe pyrene also indicates a decrease in the polarity of the DESs as temperature is increased. Addition of water to DES results in increased dipolarity/polarizability and a decrease in H-bond accepting basicity. Except for pyrene, solvatochromic probes exhibit responses close to those predicted from ideal-additive behavior with slight preferential solvation by DES within the aqueous mixtures. Pyrene response reveals significant preferential solvation by DES and/or the presence of solvent-solvent interactions, especially within aqueous mixtures of ethaline and glyceline, the DESs constituted of H-bond donors with hydroxyl functionalities. FTIR absorbance and Raman spectroscopic measurements of aqueous DES mixtures support the outcomes from solvatochromic probe responses. Aqueous mixtures of ethaline and glyceline possess relatively more interspecies H-bonds as compared to aqueous mixtures of reline, where interstitial accommodation of water within the reline molecular network appears to dominate.

While molecular dynamics s a method that is simple in its conceptual content, there are many subtle challenges that must be addressed in the construction of a simulation f a lipid bilayer in water. These include simulation algorithms, forcefields, boundary conditions, equilibration and others. We will discuss all of the basic requirements for the construction and running of a molecular dynamics simulation of a lipid bilayer. We then discuss how one analyzes the data presented by a simulation, in terms of experimental results and detailed structural and dynamical predictions of the simulation. In the final part of the chapter we show how the data from a molecular dynamics simulation can be sed to construct a coarse grained model for the heterogeneous bilayer that can predict the lateral organization and stability of rafts at up to millisecond timescales.},

  abstract = {Gaussian accelerated molecular dynamics (GaMD) is a recently developed enhanced sampling technique that provides efficient free energy calculations of biomolecules. Like the previous accelerated molecular dynamics (aMD), GaMD allows for "unconstrained" enhanced sampling without the need to set predefined collective variables and so is useful for studying complex biomolecular conformational changes such as protein folding and ligand binding. Furthermore, because the boost potential is constructed using a harmonic function that follows Gaussian distribution in GaMD, cumulant expansion to the second order can be applied to recover the original free energy profiles of proteins and other large biomolecules, which solves a long-standing energetic reweighting problem of the previous aMD method. Taken together, GaMD offers major advantages for both unconstrained enhanced sampling and free energy calculations of large biomolecules. Here, we have implemented GaMD in the NAMD package on top of the existing aMD feature and validated it on three model systems: alanine dipeptide, the chignolin fast-folding protein, and the M3 muscarinic G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR). For alanine dipeptide, while conventional molecular dynamics (cMD) simulations performed for 30 ns are poorly converged, GaMD simulations of the same length yield free energy profiles that agree quantitatively with those of 1000 ns cMD simulation. Further GaMD simulations have captured folding of the chignolin and binding of the acetylcholine (ACh) endogenous agonist to the M3 muscarinic receptor. The reweighted free energy profiles are used to characterize the protein folding and ligand binding pathways quantitatively. GaMD implemented in the scalable NAMD is widely applicable to enhanced sampling and free energy calculations of large biomolecules.},

The mutated CFTR anion channel is not fully glycosylated and shows minimal activity in bronchial epithelial cells of patients with cystic fibrosis. Low temperature or inhibition of histone deacetylases can partly rescue {$\Delta$}F508 CFTR cellular processing defects and function. A favourable change of {$\Delta$}F508 CFTR protein-protein interactions was proposed as a mechanism of rescue; however, CFTR interactome dynamics during temperature shift and inhibition of histone deacetylases are unknown. Here we report the first comprehensive analysis of the CFTR and {$\Delta$}F508 CFTR interactome and its dynamics during temperature shift and inhibition of histone deacetylases. By using a novel deep proteomic analysis method, we identify 638 individual high-confidence CFTR interactors and discover a {$\Delta$}F508 deletion-specific interactome, which is extensively remodelled upon rescue. Detailed analysis of the interactome remodelling identifies key novel interactors, whose loss promote {$\Delta$}F508 CFTR channel function in primary cystic fibrosis epithelia or which are critical for CFTR biogenesis. Our results demonstrate that global remodelling of {$\Delta$}F508 CFTR interactions is crucial for rescue, and provide comprehensive insight into the molecular disease mechanisms of cystic fibrosis caused by deletion of F508.},

In this formulation the MD cell shape and size can change according to dynamical equations given by this Lagrangian. This new MD technique is well suited to the study of structural transformations in solids under external stress and at finite temperature. As an example of the use of this technique we show how a single crystal of Ni behaves under uniform uniaxial compressive and tensile loads. This work confirms some of the results of static (i.e., zero temperature) calculations reported in the literature. We also show that some results regarding the stress-strain relation obtained by static calculations are invalid at finite temperature. We find that, under compressive loading, our model of Ni shows a bifurcation in its stress-strain relation; this bifurcation provides a link in configuration space between cubic and hexagonal close packing. It is suggested that such a transformation could perhaps be observed experimentally under extreme conditions of shock.},

In the present work, the application of DES (formed by binary mixtures of cholinium chloride and carboxylic acids or urea) as phase-forming components of aqueous biphasic systems (ABS) is investigated. The mechanisms associated with the phases demixing of ABS composed of DES, as well as the DES stability in aqueous solutions, are investigated to address the critical question whether DES-based ABS are in fact ternary or quaternary mixtures. It is shown that the DES integrity is destroyed in ABS by the disruption of the hydrogen-bonding interactions of the complex (a result of the isolated components preferential solvation by water), and as confirmed by a nonstoichiometric partition of the DES components between the coexisting phases. As a result, there are no "real" DES-based ABS; instead, there is the formation of ABS composed of four components, where the carboxylic acid used as the hydrogen-bond donor species seems to act as an additive. Finally, it is shown that these ABS have an outstanding potential to be used in extraction processes, as it is here demonstrated with the complete separation of two dyes. However, the volatile nature of short chain carboxylic acids and the nonstoichiometric partition of the DES components in ABS make the development of recovery and recycling steps more difficult to accomplish.},

  abstract = {The major cystic fibrosis causing mutation, F508del-CFTR (where CFTR is cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator), impairs biosynthetic maturation of the CFTR protein, limiting its expression as a phosphorylation-dependent channel on the cell surface. The maturation defect can be partially rescued by low-temperature (27\textdegree C) cell culture conditions or small-molecule corrector compounds. Following its partial rescue, the open probability of F508del-CFTR is enhanced by the potentiator compound, VX-770. However, the channel activity of rescued F508del-CFTR remains less than that of the Wt-CFTR protein in the presence of VX-770. In this study, we asked if there are allosteric effects of F508del on the phosphorylation-regulated R domain. To identify defects in the R domain, we compared the phosphorylation status at protein kinase A sites in the R domain of Wt and F508del-CFTR. Here we show that phosphorylation of Ser-660, quantified by SRM-MS, is reduced in F508del-CFTR. Although the generation of a phosphomimic at this site (substituting aspartic acid for serine) did not modify the maturation defect, it did enhance F508del-CFTR channel function after pharmacological rescue with corrector VX-809, and treatment with the potentiator, VX-770. These findings support the concept that defective phosphorylation of F508del-CFTR partially accounts for its altered channel activity at the cell surface.},

  abstract = {Cystic fibrosis is a lethal genetic disease caused by lack of functional cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) proteins at the apical surface of secretory epithelia. CFTR is a multidomain protein, containing five domains, and its functional structure is attained in a hierarchical folding process. Most CF-causing mutations in CFTR, including the most common mutation, a deletion of phenylalanine at position 508 (\{increment\}F508), are unable to properly fold into this functional native three dimensional structure. Currently, no highresolution structural information about full length CFTR exists. However, insight has been gained through examining homologous ABC transporter structures, molecular modeling, and high-resolution structures of individual, isolated CFTR domains. Taken together, these studies indicate that the prevalent {$\delta$}F508 mutation disrupts two essential steps during the development of the native structure: folding of the first nucleotide binding domain (NBD1) and its later association with the fourth intracellular loop (ICL4) in the second transmembrane domain (TMD2). Therapeutics to rescue \{increment\}F508 and other mutants in CFTR can be targeted to correct defects that occur during the complex folding process. This article reviews the structural relationships between CFTR and ABC transporters and current knowledge about how CFTR attains its structure-with a focus on how this process is altered by CF-causing mutations in a manner targetable by therapeutics. \textcopyright{} 2012 Patrick and Thomas.},

  abstract = {We simulated the structure of reversible protein aggregates as a function of protein surface characteristics, protein-protein interaction energies, and the entropic penalty accompanying the immobilization of protein in a solid phase. These simulations represent an extension of our previous work on kinetically irreversible protein aggregate structure and are based on an explicit accounting of the specific protein-protein interactions that occur within reversible aggregates and crystals. We considered protein monomers with a mixture of hydrophobic and hydrophilic surface regions suspended in a polar solvent; the energetic driving force for aggregation is provided by the burial of solvent-exposed hydrophobic surface area. We analyzed the physical properties of the generated aggregates, including density, protein-protein contact distributions, solvent accessible surface area, porosity, and order, and compared our results with the protein crystallization literature as well as with the kinetically irreversible case. The physical properties of reversible aggregates were consonant with those observed for the irreversible aggregates, although in general, reversible aggregates were more stable energetically and were more crystal-like in their order content than their irreversible counterparts. The reversible aggregates were less dense than the irreversible aggregates, indicating that the increased energetic stability is derived primarily from the optimality rather than the density of the packing in the solid phase. The extent of hydrophobic protein-protein contacts and solvent-exposed surface area within the aggregate phase depended on the aggregation pathway: reversible aggregates tended to have a greater proportion of hydrophobic-hydrophobic contacts and a smaller fraction of hydrophobic solvent-exposed surface area. Furthermore, the arrangement of hydrophobic patches on the protein surface played a major role in the distribution of protein contacts and solvent content. This was readily reflected in the order of the aggregates: the greater the contiguity of the hydrophobic patches on the monomer surface, the less ordered the aggregates became, despite the opportunities for rearrangement offered by a reversible pathway. These simulations have enhanced our understanding of the impact of protein structural motifs on aggregate properties and on the demarcation between aggregation and crystallization.},

  abstract = {Quantum mechanics (QM) calculations are applied to examine 1H, 13C, 15N, and 31P chemical shifts of two phosphorylation sites in an intrinsically disordered protein region. The QM calculations employ a combination of (1) structural ensembles generated by molecular dynamics, (2) a fragmentation technique based on the adjustable density matrix assembler, and (3) density functional methods. The combined computational approach is used to obtain chemical shifts (i) in the S19 and S40 residues of the nonphosphorylated and (ii) in the pS19 and pS40 residues of the doubly phosphorylated human tyrosine hydroxylase 1 as the system of interest. We study the effects of conformational averaging and explicit solvent sampling as well as the effects of phosphorylation on the computed chemical shifts. Good to great quantitative agreement with the experiment is achieved for all nuclei, provided that the systematic error cancellation is optimized by the choice of a suitable NMR standard. The effect of the standard reference on the computed 15N and 31P chemical shifts is demonstrated by employing three different referencing methods. Error bars associated with the statistical averaging of the computed 31P chemical shifts are larger than the difference between the 31P chemical shift of pS19 and pS40. The sequence trend of 31P shifts therefore could not be reliably reproduced. On the contrary, the calculations correctly predict the change of the 13C chemical shift for CB induced by the phosphorylation of the serine residues. The present work demonstrates that QM calculations coupled with molecular dynamics simulations and fragmentation techniques can be used as an alternative to empirical prediction tools in the structure characterization of intrinsically disordered proteins.}

To identify small-molecule correctors of defective cellular processing, we assayed iodide flux in {$\Delta$}F508-CFTR-transfected epithelial cells using a fluorescent halide indicator. Screening of 150,000 chemically diverse compounds and more than 1,500 analogs of active compounds yielded several classes of {$\Delta$}F508-CFTR correctors (aminoarylthiazoles, quinazolinylaminopyrimidinones, and bisaminomethylbithiazoles) with micromolar potency that produced greater apical membrane chloride current than did low-temperature rescue. Correction was seen within 3-6 hours and persisted for more than 12 hours after washout. Functional correction was correlated with plasma membrane expression of complex-glycosylated {$\Delta$}F508-CFTR protein.

Our results indicated that by explicitly introducing the multipole terms and polarization into the electrostatic potentials, the permeation free energy barrier of K+ through the gA channel is considerably reduced compared to the overestimated results obtained from the fixed-charge model. Moreover, the estimated maximum conductance, without any corrections, for both K+ and Na+ passing through the gA channel are much closer to the experimental results than any classical MD simulations, demonstrating the power of AMOEBA in investigating the membrane proteins.}

CLINICAL CASE: A patient admitted to Le Bonheur Children's Medical Center (LBCMC, Memphis, TN) showed symptoms of meconium ileus which required exploratory laparotomy, bowel resection and ileostomy. Genotyping showed DeltaF508/I1027T on one chromosome and S1118F on the other. Sweat testing on three different occasions gave negative and intermediate results (22.7, 24.6 mmol/L; 55.1, 58.6 mmol/L and 55.1, 58 mmol/L) and pancreatic elastase testing showed normal levels. OBJECTIVE: To characterize S1118F-CFTR mutation at a molecular level to help understand the associated CF-phenotype. METHODS: Molecular characterization of S1118F-CFTR mutant was studied in HEK-293 cells at 37 degrees C. Various biochemical methods such as Western blotting, real-time PCR, Pulse chase labeling and iodide efflux assay were employed. RESULTS: S1118F-CFTR makes less than 10-15\% of mature CFTR (band C) compared to WT-CFTR. The mRNA levels of S1118F-CFTR and WT-CFTR are comparable. S1118F-CFTR is functional but shows about 10-15\% of WT-CFTR activity. S1118F-CFTR shows impaired maturation and CF-correctors can increase the amount of mature and functional CFTR by three- to fourfold. CONCLUSION: S1118F-CFTR shows impaired maturation and an individual with S1118F-CFTR paired with DeltaF508-CFTR exhibits atypical CF symptoms with intermediate sweat chloride level and meconium ileus despite documented pancreatic sufficiency.},

Two guidelines were followed to deduce the pathogenicity. A total of 169 CF patients had genomic DNA submitted to a Targeted Gene Sequencing and we identified 63 variants (three patients had three variants). The most frequent alleles were: F508del (n\,=\,192), G542* (n\,=\,26), N1303K (n\,=\,11), R1162* and R334W (n\,=\,9).

To the novel variants we suggested the classification of 6b-16 exon duplication, G646* and 3557delA as Class I. There was concordance among the predictors as likely pathogenic for L935Q, cDNA.5808T{$>$}A and I1427I. Also, Y325F presented two discordant results among the predictors.

  abstract = {Analysis of molecular dynamics, for example using Markov models, often requires the identification of order parameters that are good indicators of the rare events, i.e. good reaction coordinates. Recently, it has been shown that the time-lagged independent component analysis (TICA) finds the linear combinations of input coordinates that optimally represent the slow kinetic modes and may serve in order to define reaction coordinates between the metastable states of the molecular system. A limitation of the method is that both computing time and memory requirements scale with the square of the number of input features. For large protein systems, this exacerbates the use of extensive feature sets such as the distances between all pairs of residues or even heavy atoms. Here we derive a hierarchical TICA (hTICA) method that approximates the full TICA solution by a hierarchical, divide-and-conquer calculation. By using hTICA on distances between heavy atoms we identify previously unknown relaxation processes in the bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor.}

Atomistic molecular dynamics simulations have been performed over a range of temperatures on one eutectic mixture, 1:2 choline chloride/urea, using different force field modifications. Good agreement was achieved between simulated density, volume expansion coefficient, heat capacity, and diffusion coefficients and experimental values in order to validate the best performing force field. Atom-atom and center-of-mass radial distribution functions are discussed in order to understand the atomistic interactions involved in this eutectic mixture. Experimental infrared (IR) spectra are also reported for choline chloride-urea mixtures, and band assignments are discussed. The distribution of hydrogen-bond interactions from molecular simulations is correlated to curve-resolved bands from the IR spectra. This work suggests that there is a strong interaction between the NH2 of urea and the chlorine anion where the system wants to maximize the number of hydrogen bonds to the anion. Additionally, the disappearance of free carbonyl groups upon increasing concentrations of urea suggests that at low urea concentrations, urea will preferentially interact with the anion through the NH2 groups. As this concentration increases, the complex remains but with additional interactions that remove the free carbonyl band from the spectra. The results from both molecular simulations and experimental IR spectroscopy support the idea that key interactions between the moieties in the eutectic mixture interrupt the main interactions within the parent substances and are responsible for the decrease in freezing point. \textcopyright{} 2013 American Chemical Society.}

In this work, three choline chloride-based DESs are simulated using molecular dynamics to study the hydrogen bonding interactions of the system. Three hydrogen bond donors (HBD) are studied in order to determine the changes in the hydrogen bonding interactions when the HBD is different in the DES. One dicarboxylic acid and two polyols (with different number of OH groups) were chosen as the HBDs of interest. First, the simulations are validated by comparing simulated and experimental thermodynamic and transport properties, when possible. Then, for maline (choline chloride/malonic acid), the more anomalous system studied here, molecular simulations complement results obtained from an FTIR spectroscopic study in order to further understand this unique system. Good agreement with experimental values was obtained for simulated density, heat capacity, and transport properties. A high relative percent of hydrogen bonding is observed for interactions between the anion and the HBD for the three main systems studied here, consistent with the nature of how these moieties interact in DESs. Comparison is also done with a previous DES studied in our group. From the infrared spectroscopic study conducted on maline films, band assignments were discussed highlighting a "free" carbonyl group of the carboxylic acid group in the eutectic mixture when the OH group is hydrogen bonded to something else. Additionally, a band is assigned to a hydrogen bonded carbonyl group. These band assignments are consistent with findings in the molecular simulations and highlight the predominant interactions of the system.}

Transverse relaxation-optimized spectroscopy (TROSY) is an approach for suppression of transverse relaxation in multidimensional NMR experiments, which is based on constructive use of interference between DD coupling and CSA. For example, a TROSY-type two-dimensional 1H,15N-correlation experiment with a uniformly 15N-labeled protein in a DNA complex of molecular mass 17 kDa at a 1H frequency of 750 MHz showed that 15N relaxation during 15N chemical shift evolution and 1HN relaxation during signal acquisition both are significantly reduced by mutual compensation of the DD and CSA interactions. The reduction of the linewidths when compared with a conventional two-dimensional 1H,15N-correlation experiment was 60\% and 40\%, respectively, and the residual linewidths were 5 Hz for 15N and 15 Hz for 1HN at 4\textdegree C. Because the ratio of the DD and CSA relaxation rates is nearly independent of the molecular size, a similar percentagewise reduction of the overall transverse relaxation rates is expected for larger proteins. For a 15N-labeled protein of 150 kDa at 750 MHz and 20\textdegree C one predicts residual linewidths of 10 Hz for 15N and 45 Hz for 1HN, and for the corresponding uniformly 15N,2H-labeled protein the residual linewidths are predicted to be smaller than 5 Hz and 15 Hz, respectively. The TROSY principle should benefit a variety of multidimensional solution NMR experiments, especially with future use of yet somewhat higher polarizing magnetic fields than are presently available, and thus largely eliminate one of the key factors that limit work with larger molecules.},

Ligand binding modulates the GPCR molecular free energy landscape by preferentially stabilizing active or inactive conformations that dictate intracellular protein recruitment and downstream signaling. We perform enhanced sampling molecular dynamics simulations to recover the free energy surfaces of a thermostable mutant of the GPCR serotonin receptor 5-HT2B in the unliganded form and bound to a lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) agonist and lisuride antagonist. LSD binding imparts a *110 kJ/mol driving force for conformational rearrangement into an active state. The lisuride-bound form is structurally similar to the apo form and only *24 kJ/mol more stable. This work quantifies ligand-induced conformational specificity and functional selectivity of 5-HT2B and presents a platform for high-throughput virtual screening of ligands and rational engineering of the ligand-bound molecular free energy landscape.},

  abstract = {Traditionally, the dependence of enzyme activity on temperature has been described by a model consisting of two processes: the catalytic reaction defined by {$\Delta$}GDaggercat, and irreversible inactivation defined by {$\Delta$}GDaggerinact. However, such a model does not account for the observed temperature-dependent behaviour of enzymes, and a new model has been developed and validated. This model (the Equilibrium Model) describes a new mechanism by which enzymes lose activity at high temperatures, by including an inactive form of the enzyme (Einact) that is in reversible equilibrium with the active form (Eact); it is the inactive form that undergoes irreversible thermal inactivation to the thermally denatured state. This equilibrium is described by an equilibrium constant whose temperature-dependence is characterized in terms of the enthalpy of the equilibrium, {$\Delta$}Heq, and a new thermal parameter, Teq, which is the temperature at which the concentrations of Eact and Einact are equal; Teq may therefore be regarded as the thermal equivalent of Km. Characterization of an enzyme with respect to its temperature-dependent behaviour must therefore include a determination of these intrinsic properties. The Equilibrium Model has major implications for enzymology, biotechnology and understanding the evolution of enzymes. The present study presents a new direct data-fitting method based on fitting progress curves directly to the Equilibrium Model, and assesses the robustness of this procedure and the effect of assay data on the accurate determination of Teq and its associated parameters. It also describes simpler experimental methods for their determination than have been previously available, including those required for the application of the Equilibrium Model to non-ideal enzyme reactions.},

Starting from the crystal structure, the all-atom modeling allows us to calculate a parameterfree ion conductance in semiquantitative agreement with experiment. Discrepancies between modeling and experiment occur, e.g., at salt concentrations above 1 M KCl or at high temperatures. At lower salt concentrations, the ions have separate pathways along the channel surface. The constriction zone in the channel contains, on one side, a series of positively charges (R42, R82, R132), and on the opposite side, two negatively charged residues (D113, E117). Mutations generated in the constriction zone by removing cationic residues enhance the otherwise small cation selectivity, whereas removing the anionic residues reverses the selectivity. Reduction of the negatively charged residues decreases the conductance by half, whereas cationic residues enhance the conductance. Experiments on mutants confirm the results of the molecular-level simulations.},

The precise role of the aggregates in disease progression has been difficult to elucidate because of the diversity of aggregated states they can adopt. Here, we study the formation of fibrils and oligomers by exon 1 of huntingtin protein. We show that the oligomer states are consistent with polymer micelles that are limited in size by the stretching entropy of the polyglutamine region. The model shows how the sequences flanking the amyloid core modulate aggregation behavior. The N17 region promotes aggregation through weakly attractive interactions, whereas the C38 tail opposes aggregation via steric repulsion. We also show that the energetics of cross-{$\beta$} stacking by polyglutamine would produce fibrils with many alignment defects, but minor perturbations from the flanking sequences are sufficient to reduce the defects to the level observed in experiment. We conclude with a discussion of the implications of this model for other amyloid-forming molecules.}

We provide evidence here to support combination potentiator (co-potentiator) therapy for mutant CFTRs that are poorly responsive to single potentiators. Methods: Functional synergy screens done on N1303K and W1282X CFTR, in which small molecules were tested with VX-770, identified arylsulfonamide-pyrrolopyridine, phenoxy-benzimidazole and flavone co-potentiators. Results: A previously identified arylsulfonamide-pyrrolopyridine co-potentiator (ASP-11) added with VX-770 increased N1303K-CFTR current 7-fold more than VX-770 alone. ASP-11 increased by {\~ }65\% of the current of G551D-CFTR compared to VX-770, was additive with VX-770 on F508del-CFTR, and activated wild-type CFTR in the absence of a cAMP agonist. ASP-11 efficacy with VX-770 was demonstrated in primary CF human airway cell cultures having N1303K, W1282X and G551D CFTR mutations. Structure-activity studies on 11 synthesized ASP-11 analogs produced compounds with EC 50 down to 0.5 {$\mu$}M. Conclusions: These studies support combination potentiator therapy for CF caused by some CFTR mutations that are not effectively treated by single potentiators.},

Increased CFTR chloride conductance by up to 8-fold was observed when a co-potentiator (termed `Class II potentiator') was used with a classical potentiator (`Class I potentiator') such as VX-770 or GLPG1837. To investigate the range of CFTR mutations benefitted by co-potentiators, 14 CF-associated CFTR mutations were studied in transfected cell models. Co-potentiator efficacy was found for CFTR missense, deletion and nonsense mutations in nucleotide binding domain-2 (NBD2), including W1282X, N1303K, c.3700A {$>$} G and Q1313X (with corrector for some mutations). In contrast, CFTR mutations G85E, R334W, R347P, V520F, R560T, A561E, M1101K and R1162X showed no co-potentiator activity, even with corrector.

The quantitative comparison of simulation results with various forms of experimental data probing different aspects of the folding process can facilitate robust assessment of the accuracy of the calculations while providing a detailed structural interpretation for the experimental observations. In the example studied here, the analysis of folding rates, {$\mathbb{P}$}-values, and folding pathways provides support for the notion that a norleucine double mutant of villin folds five times faster than the wild-type sequence, but following a slightly different pathway. This work showcases how computer simulation has now developed into a mature tool for the quantitative computational study of protein folding and dynamics that can provide a valuable complement to experimental techniques.},

The extent to which the conclusions drawn from the analysis of such proteins, which fold on the microsecond timescale, apply to the millisecond or slower folding of naturally occurring proteins is, however, unclear. As a first attempt to address this outstanding issue, we examine here the folding of ubiquitin, a 76-residue-long protein found in all eukaryotes that is known experimentally to fold on a millisecond timescale. Ubiquitin folding has been the subject of many experimental studies, but its slow folding rate has made it difficult to observe and characterize the folding process through all-atom molecular dynamics simulations. Here we determine the mechanism, thermodynamics, and kinetics of ubiquitin folding through equilibrium atomistic simulations. The picture emerging from the simulations is in agreement with a view of ubiquitin folding suggested from previous experiments. Our findings related to the folding of ubiquitin are also consistent, for the most part, with the folding principles derived from the simulation of fast-folding proteins, suggesting that these principles may be applicable to a wider range of proteins.},

  abstract = {Regulation of epithelial chloride flux, which is defective in patients with cystic fibrosis, may be mediated by phosphorylation of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) by cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) or protein kinase C (PKC). Part of the R-domain of CFTR (termed CF-2) was expressed in and purified from Escherichia coli. CF-2 was phosphorylated on seryl residues by PKA, PKC, cyclic GMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG), and calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase I (CaM kinase I). Direct amino acid sequencing and peptide mapping of CF-2 revealed that serines 660, 700, 737, and 813 as well as serine 768, serine 795, or both were phosphorylated by PKA and PKG, and serines 686 and 790 were phosphorylated by PKC. CFTR was phosphorylated in vitro by PKA, PKC, or PKG on the same sites that were phosphorylated in CF-2. Kinetic analysis of phosphorylation of CF-2 and of synthetic peptides confirmed that these sites were excellent substrates for PKA, PKC, or PKG. CFTR was immunoprecipitated from T84 cells labeled with 32Pi. Its phosphorylation was stimulated in response to agents that activated either PKA or PKC. Peptide mapping confirmed that CFTR was phosphorylated at several sites identified in vitro. Thus, regulation of CFTR is likely to occur through direct phosphorylation of the R-domain by protein kinases stimulated by different second messenger pathways.},

A previous report has shown that filamin A (FLNa), an actin-cross-linking and -scaffolding protein, interacts directly with the cytoplasmic N terminus of CFTR and that this interaction is necessary for stability and confinement of the channel to apical membranes. Here, we report that the CFTR N terminus has sequence similarity to known FLNa-binding partner-binding sites. FLNa has 24 Ig (IgFLNa) repeats, and a CFTR peptide pulled down repeats 9, 12, 17, 19, 21, and 23, which share sequence similarity yet differ from the other FLNa Ig domains. Using known structures of IgFLNa{$\cdot$}partner complexes as templates, we generated in silico models of IgFLNa{$\cdot$}CFTR peptide complexes. Point and deletion mutants of IgFLNa and CFTR informed by the models, including disease-causing mutations L15P and W19C, disrupted the binding interaction. The model predicted that a P5L CFTR mutation should not affect binding, but a synthetic P5L mutant peptide had reduced solubility, suggesting a different disease-causing mechanism. Taken together with the fact that FLNa dimers are elongated {\~(}160 nm) strands, whereas CFTR is compact (6-8 nm), we propose that a single FLNa molecule can scaffold multiple CFTR partners. Unlike previously defined dimeric FLNa{$\cdot$}partner complexes, the FLNa-monomeric CFTR interaction is relatively weak, presumptively facilitating dynamic clustering of CFTR at cell membranes. Finally, we show that deletion of all CFTR interacting domains from FLNa suppresses the surface expression of CFTR on baby hamster kidney cells.},

Here we implement a simple method that is thermodynamically rigorous and possesses none of the above disadvantages, and we report on the method's feasibility and computational demands. We calculate infinitely dilute partial molar properties for two proteins and attempt to distinguish the thermodynamic differences between a native and a denatured conformation of a designed miniprotein. We conclude that simple ensemble average properties can be calculated with very reasonable amounts of computational power. In contrast, properties corresponding to fluctuating quantities are computationally demanding to calculate precisely, although they can be obtained more easily by following the temperature and/or pressure dependence of the corresponding ensemble averages.

  abstract = {As access to computational resources continues to increase, free-energy calculations have emerged as a powerful tool that can play a predictive role in a wide range of research areas. Yet, the reliability of these calculations can often be improved significantly if a number of precepts, or good practices, are followed. Although the theory upon which these good practices rely has largely been known for many years, it is often overlooked or simply ignored. In other cases, the theoretical developments are too recent for their potential to be fully grasped and merged into popular platforms for the computation of free-energy differences. In this contribution, the current best practices for carrying out free-energy calculations using free energy perturbation and nonequilibrium work methods are discussed, demonstrating that at little to no additional cost, free-energy estimates could be markedly improved and bounded by meaningful error estimates. Monitoring the probability distributions that underlie the transformation between the states of interest, performing the calculation bidirectionally, stratifying the reaction pathway, and choosing the most appropriate paradigms and algorithms for transforming between states offer significant gains in both accuracy and precision. \textcopyright{} 2010 American Chemical Society.}

  abstract = {Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are a recently developed technology in which fully differentiated cells such as fibroblasts from individual CF patients can be repaired with [wildtype] CFTR, and reprogrammed to differentiate into fully differentiated cells characteristic of the proximal and distal airways. Here, we review properties of different epithelial cells in the airway, and the in vitro genetic roadmap which iPSCs follow as they are step-wise differentiated into either basal stem cells, for the proximal airway, or into Type II Alveolar cells for the distal airways. The central theme is that iPSC-derived basal stem cells, are penultimately dependent on NOTCH signaling for differentiation into club cells, goblet cells, ciliated cells, and neuroendocrine cells. Furthermore, given the proper matrix, these cellular progenies are also able to self-assemble into a fully functional pseudostratified squamous proximal airway epithelium. By contrast, club cells are reserve stem cells which are able to either differentiate into goblet or ciliated cells, but also to de-differentiate into basal stem cells. Variant club cells, located at the transition between airway and alveoli, may also be responsible for differentiation into Type II Alveolar cells, which then differentiate into Type I Alveolar cells for gas exchange in the distal airway. Using gene editing, the mutant CFTR gene in iPSCs from CF patients can be repaired, and fully functional epithelial cells can thus be generated through directed differentiation. However, there is a limitation in that the lung has other CFTR-dependent cells besides epithelial cells. Another limitation is that there are CFTR-dependent cells in other organs which would continue to contribute to CF disease. Furthermore, there are also bystander or modifier genes which affect disease outcome, not only in the lung, but specifically in other CF-affected organs. Finally, we discuss future personalized applications of the iPSC technology, many of which have already survived the ``proof-of-principle'' test. These include (i) patient-derived iPSCs used as a ``lung-on-a-chip'' tool for personalized drug discovery; (ii) replacement of mutant lung cells by wildtype lung cells in the living lung; and (iii) development of bio-artificial lungs. It is hoped that this review will give the reader a roadmap through the most complicated of the obstacles, and foster a guardedly optimistic view of how some of the remaining obstacles might one day be overcome.},

After a brief survey of current models, mostly generated during the 1990s, the focus of the chapter is on the general directions the field is taking in developing new models. The most commonly used protein force fields incorporate a relatively simple potential energy function: The emphasis is on the use of continuum methods to model the electrostatic effects of hydration and the introduction of polarizability to model the electronic response to changes in the environment. Some of the history and performance of widely used protein force fields based on an equation on simplest potential energy function or closely related equations are reviewed. The chapter outlines some promising developments that go beyond this, primarily by altering the way electrostatic interactions are treated. The use of atomic multipoles and off-center charge distributions, as well as attempts to incorporate electronic polarizability, are also discussed in the chapter.},

Most of the men with CF ({$>$}95\%) have congenital bilateral absence of vas deferens (CBAVD), which makes them infertile. However, with advances in assisted reproductive techniques, it is now potentially possible for these patients to father their own biological children. Spermatozoa may be retrieved from either the epididymis or the testes and combined in vitro with oocytes retrieved from the female partner. Epididymal sperm may be collected either by microsurgical or percutaneous epididymal sperm aspiration. It is important to remember that when assisted reproductive techniques are used for such patients, there is the inevitability of transmitting a mutated cystic fibrosis transmembrane (CFTR) gene, which increases the risk of producing an affected child and can have serious long-term implications. It is therefore mandatory to offer genetic counselling to the men with CF (and CBAVD) and their partners before carrying out assisted reproductive techniques. In the literature, there are a very few studies on fertility treatment of these men. However, even though the reported number of live births in men with CF is small, given the current technology, there are definitely more opportunities for these men to become parents.},

This situation has prompted the design of alternative surfactants that can be substituted for detergents once target proteins have been extracted from biological membranes and that keep them soluble in aqueous buffers while stabilizing them. The present review focuses on three such systems: Amphipols (APols) are amphipathic polymers that adsorb onto the hydrophobic transmembrane surface of MPs; nanodiscs (NDs) are small patches of lipid bilayer whose rim is stabilized by amphipathic proteins; fluorinated surfactants (FSs) resemble detergents but interfere less than detergents do with stabilizing protein/protein and protein/lipid interactions. The structure and properties of each of these three systems are described, as well as those of the complexes they form with MPs. Their respective usefulness, constraints, and prospects for functional and structural studies of MPs are discussed.},

  abstract = {The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is an epithelial Cl- channel regulated by protein kinase A. The most common mutation in cystic fibrosis (CF), deletion of Phe-508 (delta F508-CFTR), reduces Cl- secretion, but the fatal consequences of CF have been difficult to rationalize solely in terms of this defect. The aim of this study was to determine the role of CFTR in HCO3- transport across cell membranes. HCO3- permeability was assessed from measurements of intracellular pH [pHi; from spectrofluorimetry of the pH-sensitive dye 2',7'-bis(2-carboxyethyl)-5-(and -6)carboxyfluorescein] and of channel activity (patch clamp; cell attached and isolated, inside-out patches) on NIH 3T3 fibroblasts and C127 mammary epithelial cells transfected with wild-type CFTR (WT-CFTR) or delta F508-CFTR, and also on mock-transfected cells. When WT-CFTR-transfected cells were acidified (pulsed with NH4Cl) and incubated in Na(+)-free (N-methyl-D-glucamine substitution) solutions (to block Na(+)-dependent pHi regulatory mechanisms), pHi remained acidic (pH approximately 6.5) until the cells were treated with 20 microM forskolin (increases cellular [cAMP]); pHi then increased toward (but not completely to) control level (pHi 7.2) at a rate of 0.055 pH unit/min. Forskolin had no effect on rate of pHi recovery in delta F508 and mock-transfected cells. This Na(+)-independent, forskolin-dependent pHi recovery was not observed in HCO3-/CO2-free medium. Forskolin-treated WT-CFTR-transfected (but not delta F508-CFTR or mock-transfected) cells in Cl(-)-containing, HCO3(-)-free solutions showed Cl- channels with a linear I/V relationship and a conductance of 10.4 +/- 0.5 pS in symmetrical 150 mM Cl-. When channels were incubated with different [Cl-] and [HCO3-] on the inside and outside, the Cl-/HCO3- permeability ratio (determined from reversal potentials of I/V curves) was 3.8 +/- 1.0 (mean +/- SEM; n = 9); the ratio of conductances was 3.9 +/- 0.5 (at 150 mM Cl- and 127 mM HCO3-. We conclude that in acidified cells the WT-CFTR functions as a base loader by allowing a cAMP-dependent influx of HCO3- through channels that conduct HCO3- about one-quarter as efficiently as it conducts Cl-. Under physiological conditions, the electrochemical gradients for both Cl- and HCO3- are directed outward, so CFTR likely contributes to the epithelial secretion of both ions. HCO3- secretion may be important for controlling pH of the luminal, but probably not the cytoplasmic, fluid in CFTR-containing epithelia. In CF, a decreased secretion of HCO3- may lead to decreased pH of the luminal fluid.},

CFTR function was assessed in vivo via nasal potential difference (NPD) and in human nasal epithelial (HNE) cultures by the response to Forskolin/IBMX and the CFTR potentiator VX-770 in short-circuit-current ({$\increment$}IscF/I+V) experiments. CFTR expression was evaluated by apical membrane fluorescence semi-quantification. Isc measurements discriminated CFTR function between controls, healthy heterozygotes, patients homozygous for the severe F508del mutation and patients with genotypes leading to absent or residual function. {$\increment$}IscF/I+V correlated with CFTR cellular apical expression and NPD measurements. The CFTR correctors lumacaftor and tezacaftor significantly increased the {$\increment$}IscF/I+V response to about 25\% (SEM\,=\,4.4) of the WT-CFTR level and the CFTR apical expression to about 22\% (SEM\,=\,4.6) of the WT-CFTR level in F508del/F508del HNE cells. The level of CFTR correction in HNE cultures significantly correlated with the FEV1 change at 6 months in 8 patients treated with CFTR modulators. We provide the first evidence that correction of CFTR function in HNE cell cultures can predict respiratory improvement by CFTR modulators.},

Because CF-causing mutations can affect CFTR gating as well as its biogenesis, multi-assay approaches have been implemented to sequentially screen for channel function and membrane density. Here we present the first assay capable of simultaneous assessment of both CFTR characteristics.To validate our assay, we investigate F508del-CFTR, the most common disease-causing CFTR mutant, confirming rescue by incubation at low temperature, treatment with corrector VX-809 and introduction of the second-site revertant mutation R1070W. Furthermore, we confirm a decrease in F508del-CFTR membrane density due to presence of potentiator VX-770 during VX-809 treatment. Finally, we characterize a panel of rare CF-causing mutations, confirming profiles obtained with Western blots and Ussing-chamber electrophysiology. We discuss how profiling effects of acute VX-770 treatment on the rare mutation panel can provide mechanistic insight on drug action.Because our assay quantifies simultaneously CFTR localization and function, it yields more accurate information on gating and permeation properties than can be inferred from separate measurements. By providing a two-dimensional molecular characterization of individual mutant CFTR proteins, our assay is a powerful tool for development of therapies truly addressing the root cause of each individual patient's cystic fibrosis disease.}

  abstract = {Cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) is widely used to study biological macromolecules that comprise regions with disorder, flexibility or partial occupancy. For example, membrane proteins are often kept in solution with detergent micelles and lipid nanodiscs that are locally disordered. Such spatial variability negatively impacts computational three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction with existing iterative refinement algorithms that assume rigidity. We introduce non-uniform refinement, an algorithm based on cross-validation optimization, which automatically regularizes 3D density maps during refinement to account for spatial variability. Unlike common shift-invariant regularizers, non-uniform refinement systematically removes noise from disordered regions, while retaining signal useful for aligning particle images, yielding dramatically improved resolution and 3D map quality in many cases. We obtain high-resolution reconstructions for multiple membrane proteins as small as 100 kDa, demonstrating increased effectiveness of cryo-EM for this class of targets critical in structural biology and drug discovery. Non-uniform refinement is implemented in the cryoSPARC software package.}

  abstract = {In eukaryotic cells Rab/Ypt GTPases represent a family of key membrane traffic controllers that associate with their targeted membranes via C-terminally conjugated geranyl-geranyl groups. GDP dissociation inhibitor (GDI) is a general and essential regulator of Rab recycling that extracts prenylated Rab proteins from membranes at the end of their cycle of activity and facilitates their delivery to the donor membranes. Here, we present the structure of a complex between GDI and a doubly prenylated Rab protein. We show that one geranylgeranyl residue is deeply buried in a hydrophobic pocket formed by domain II of GDI, whereas the other lipid is more exposed to solvent and is skewed across several atoms of the first moiety. Based on structural information and biophysical measurements, we propose mechanistic and thermodynamic models for GDI and Rab escort protein-mediated interaction of RabGTPase with intracellular membranes. \textcopyright{} 2006 European Molecular Biology Organization | All Rights Reserved.},

The imprinted microspheres made with IL could obtain the good recognition ability to template protein, whereas the imprinted polymer synthesized in the absence of it had a similar adsorption capacity to the non-imprinted one. Furthermore, the preparation conditions of imprinted polymers (MIPs) including the content of IL, temperature of polymerization, and types of functional monomers and crosslinkers were systematically analyzed via circular dichroism spectrum and activity assay. The results illustrated that using hydroxyethyl acrylate as the functional monomer, ethylene glycol dimethacrylate as the crosslinker, 5 \% IL as the stabilizer, and 75\textdegree C as the reaction temperature could retain the structure of template protein as much as possible. The obtained MIPs showed excellent recognition ability to the template protein with the separation factor and selectivity factor value of 4.30 and 2.21, respectively. Consequently, it is an effective way to accurately imprint and separate template protein by cooperatively using circular dichroism spectroscopy and activity assay during the preparation of protein MIPs. The method of utilizing IL to stabilizing protein at high temperature would offer a good opportunity for various technologies to improve the development of macromolecules imprinting.},

  abstract = {Cystic fibrosis is a hereditary disease that originates from mutations in the epithelial chloride channel CFTR. Whereas established therapies for the treatment of cystic fibrosis target CFTR to repair its function, alternative therapeutic strategies aim for the restoration of chloride transport by the activation of other chloride transport proteins such as TMEM16A or SLC26A9 or by the application of synthetic anionophores. TMEM16A is an anion-selective channel that is activated by the binding of Ca2+ from the cytoplasm. Pharmacological efforts aim for the increase of its open probability at resting Ca2+ concentrations. SLC26 is an uncoupled chloride transporter, which shuttles chloride across the membrane by an alternate-access mechanism. Its activation requires its mobilization from intracellular stores. Finally, anionophores are small synthetic molecules that bind chloride to form lipid-soluble complexes, which shuttle the anion across the membrane. All three approaches are currently pursued and have provided promising initial results.},

Whereas mammalian glucose transporters (GLUTs) are specialists1, the hexose transporter from the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum PfHT12,3 has acquired the ability to transport both glucose and fructose sugars as efficiently as the dedicated glucose (GLUT3) and fructose (GLUT5) transporters. Here, to establish the molecular basis of sugar promiscuity in malaria parasites, we determined the crystal structure of PfHT1 in complex with d-glucose at a resolution of 3.6~\AA. We found that the sugar-binding site in PfHT1 is very similar to those of the distantly related GLUT3 and GLUT5 structures4,5. Nevertheless, engineered PfHT1 mutations made to match GLUT sugar-binding sites did not shift sugar preferences. The extracellular substrate-gating helix TM7b in PfHT1 was positioned in a fully occluded conformation, providing a unique glimpse into how sugar binding and gating are coupled. We determined that polar contacts between TM7b and TM1 (located about 15~\AA{} from d-glucose) are just as critical for transport as the residues that directly coordinate d-glucose, which demonstrates a strong allosteric coupling between sugar binding and gating. We conclude that PfHT1 has achieved substrate promiscuity not by modifying its sugar-binding site, but instead by evolving substrate-gating dynamics.},

  abstract = {Comparisons were made among four categories of protein flexibility: (1) low-B-factor ordered regions, (2) high-B-factor ordered regions, (3) short disordered regions, and (4) long disordered regions. Amino acid compositions of the four categories were found to be significantly different from each other, with high-B-factor ordered and short disordered regions being the most similar pair. The high-B-factor (flexible) ordered regions are characterized by a higher average flexibility index, higher average hydrophilicity, higher average absolute net charge, and higher total charge than disordered regions. The low-B-factor regions are significantly enriched in hydrophobic residues and depleted in the total number of charged residues compared to the other three categories. We examined the predictability of the high-B-factor regions and developed a predictor that discriminates between regions of low and high B-factors. This predictor achieved an accuracy of 70\% and a correlation of 0.43 with experimental data, outperforming the 64\% accuracy and 0.32 correlation of predictors based solely on flexibility indices. To further clarify the differences between short disordered regions and ordered regions, a predictor of short disordered regions was developed. Its relatively high accuracy of 81\% indicates considerable differences between ordered and disordered regions. The distinctive amino acid biases of high-B-factor ordered regions, short disordered regions, and long disordered regions indicate that the sequence determinants for these flexibility categories differ from one another, whereas the significantly-greater-than-chance predictability of these categories from sequence suggest that flexible ordered regions, short disorder, and long disorder are, to a significant degree, encoded at the primary structure level.},

Although general features of the structure of CFTR have been predicted from homology models, the conformational changes that result in channel opening and closing have yet to be resolved. We created new closed- and open-state homology models of CFTR, and performed targeted molecular dynamics simulations of the conformational transitions in a channel opening event. The simulations predict a conformational wave that starts at the nucleotide binding domains and ends with the formation of an open conduction pathway. Changes in side-chain interactions are observed in all major domains of the protein, and experimental confirmation was obtained for a novel intra-protein salt bridge that breaks near the end of the transition. The models and simulation add to our understanding of the mechanism of ATP-dependent gating in this disease-relevant ion channel. \textcopyright{} 2013 Rahman et al.}

We have in the past shown that Trp326 of Walker B and Cys193 of Walker A motifs of N-terminal NBD of Cdr1p have distinct roles in ATP binding and hydrolysis, respectively. In the present study, we have examined the role of a well conserved Asp327 in the Walker B motif of the N-terminal NBD which is preceded (Trp326) and followed (Asn328) by atypical amino acid substitutions and compared it with its equivalent well conserved Asp1026 of the C-terminal NBD of Cdr1p. We observed that the removal of the negative charge by D327N, D327A, D1026N, D1026A and D327N/D1026N substitutions, resulted in Cdr1p mutant variants that were severely impaired in ATPase activity and drug efflux. Importantly, all the mutant variants showed characteristics similar to those of wild type with respect to cell surface expression and photoaffinity drug analogue [125I] IAAP and [3H] azidopine labeling. While Cdr1p D327N mutant variant showed comparable binding with [{$\alpha$}-32P] 8-azido ATP, Cdr1p D1026N and Cdr1p D327N/D1026N mutant variants were crippled in nucleotide binding. That the two conserved carboxylate residues Asp327 and Asp1026 are functionally different was further evident from the pH profile of ATPase activity. Cdr1p D327N mutant variant showed {$\sim$}40\% enhancement of its residual ATPase activity at acidic pH while no such pH effect was seen with Cdr1p D1026N mutant variant. Our experimental data suggest that Asp327 of N-terminal NBD has acquired a new role to act as a catalytic base in ATP hydrolysis, a role normally conserved for Glu present adjacent to the conserved Asp in the Walker B motif of all the non-fungal transporters.},

This method has been successfully applied in many different fields, ranging from chemistry to biophysics and ligand docking and from material science to crystal structure prediction. We present an important development that speeds up metadynamics calculations by orders of magnitude and renders the algorithm much more robust. We use multiple interacting simulations, walkers, for exploring and reconstructing the same free energy surface. Each walker contributes to the history-dependent potential that, in metadynamics, is an estimate of the free energy. We show that the error on the reconstructed free energy does not depend on the number of walkers, leading to a fully linear scaling algorithm even on inexpensive loosely coupled clusters of PCs. In addition, we show that the accuracy and stability of the method are much improved by combining it with a weighted histogram analysis. We check the validity of our new method on a realistic application.},

  abstract = {Tuberculosis (TB) is a serious communicative disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Although there are vaccines and drugs available to treat the disease, they are not efficient, moreover, multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) become a major hurdle in its therapy. These MDR strains utilize the multidrug efflux pump as a decisive weapon to fight against antitubercular drugs. Tap membrane protein was observed as a crucial multidrug efflux pump in M. tuberculosis and its critical implication in MDR-MTB development makes it an effective drug target. In the present study, we have utilized various in silico approaches to predict the applicability of FDA-approved ion channel inhibitors and blockers as therapeutic leads against Tuberculosis by targeting multidrug efflux protein; Tap in MTB. Tap protein structure is predicted by Phyre2 server followed by model refinement, validation, physio-chemical catheterization and target prediction. Further, the interaction between Tap protein and ligands were analysed by molecular docking and MD simulation run of 100 ns. Based on implication and compatibility, 18 FDA-approved ion channel inhibitors and blockers are selected as a ligand against the Tap protein and eventually observed five ligands; Glimepiride, Flecainide, Flupiritine, Nimodipine and Amlodipine as promising compounds which have exhibited the significant stable interaction with Tap protein and are proposed to modulate or interfere with its activity. These compounds illustrated the substantial docking score and total binding enthalpy more than -7 kcal/mol and -42 kcal/mol respectively which implies that the selected FDA-approved compounds can spontaneously interact with the Tap protein to modulate its function. This study proposed Tap protein as a prominent drug target in MTB and investigated compounds that show considerable interaction with the Tap protein as potential therapeutic molecules. These interactions may lead to modulating or inhibit the activity of drug efflux protein thereby making MTB susceptible to antitubercular drugs. A deep insight into the 3D structures of the proteins is essential to understand their functions and will be helpful in drug design and making decisions for the treatment of diseases. The 3D structure for less than one-thousandth of the protein sequences has been determined so far due to the slow structure elucidation procedures with experimental methods, such as X-ray. For this reason, different computational methods were used to determine the structure of the proteins, including template-based and de novo approaches. Much software has been developed to facilitate the computational approaches in protein modeling, some of which need user expertise and extensive knowledge in bioinformatics. The present study attempted to provide a user-friendly environment to motivate the researchers in computational biology, a Python-based interface based on MODELLER software. PyProtModel can be used as a toolbox in structural bioinformatics for protein modeling from sequence to the prediction of 3D structure. In addition, the users can take benefits of PyProtModel in order to prepare and evaluate protein PDB files prior to other in silico experiments. PyProtModel allows the user to apply different MODELLER options, automates, and speeds up time-consuming homology modeling steps. Different aspects of PyProtModel and a comprehensive view of the application will be discussed in this paper. The application is available for download and use at: https://github.com/msisakht/pyprotmodel.git. Typhoid disease caused by the bacterium Salmonella typhi becomes fatal if not treated timely. To expedite its timely and accurate diagnosis at an early stage, a biomimetic sensor based on epitope imprinting technique is developed for the detection of typhoid. Epitope sequence of Salmonella invasive protein D (SipD) was predicted using immunoinformatic tools and utilized for imprinting. A molecularly imprinted matrix was developed on the surface of quartz crystal microbalance chip through electropolymerization in presence of template - a 14-mer synthetic peptide predicted. Binding of {$\sim$} -3000 Hz from the blood plasma sample of infected persons showed the selectivity of imprinted sites towards the SipD proteins of bacteria. The sensor was able to detect bacteria at an early stage with an LOD value of 0.50 (ng/ml). On extraction of the peptide sequence, imprinted cavities were able to selectively and specifically bind targeted epitope sequences in laboratory samples as well as `real' samples of patients. An accurate, robust, cost-effective, facile diagnostic tool to aid the healthcare industry is presented here. Recent developments in the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic point to its inevitable transformation into an endemic disease, urging both refinement of diagnostics for emerging variants of concern (VOCs) and design of variant-specific drugs in addition to vaccine adjustments. Exploring the structure and dynamics of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein, we argue that the high-mutability characteristic of RNA viruses coupled with the remarkable flexibility and dynamics of viral proteins result in a substantial involvement of allosteric mechanisms. While allosteric effects of mutations should be considered in predictions and diagnostics of new VOCs, allosteric drugs advantageously avoid escape mutations via non-competitive inhibition originating from alternative distal locations. The exhaustive allosteric signaling and probing maps presented herein provide a comprehensive picture of allostery in the spike protein, making it possible to locate potential mutations that could work as new VOC ``drivers'' and to determine binding patches that may be targeted by newly developed allosteric drugs. Structure-based antibody design and accurate predictions of antibody-antigen interactions remain major challenges in computational biology. By using molecular dynamics simulations, we show that a single static X-ray structure is not sufficient to identify determinants of antibody-antigen recognition. Here, we investigate antibodies that undergo substantial conformational changes upon antigen binding and have been classified as difficult cases in an extensive benchmark for antibody-antigen docking. We present thermodynamics and transition kinetics of these conformational rearrangements and show that paratope states can be used to improve antibody-antigen docking. By using the unbound antibody X-ray structure as starting structure for molecular dynamics simulations, we retain a binding competent conformation substantially different to the unbound antibody X-ray structure. We also observe that the kinetically dominant antibody paratope conformations are chosen by the bound antigen conformation with the highest probability. Thus, we show that paratope states in solution can improve antibody-antigen docking and structure prediction.},

  abstract = {Rationale: Given the vast number of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) mutations, biomarkers predicting benefit from CFTR modulator therapies are needed for subjects with cystic fibrosis (CF). Objectives: To study CFTR function in organoids of subjects with common and rare CFTR mutations and evaluate correlations between CFTR function and clinical data. Methods: Intestinal organoids were grown from rectal biopsies in a cohort of 97 subjects with CF. Residual CFTR function was measured by quantifying organoid swelling induced by forskolin and response to modulators by quantifying organoid swelling induced by CFTR correctors, potentiator and their combination. Organoid data were correlated with clinical data from the literature. Results: Across 28 genotypes, residual CFTR function correlated (r2=0.87) with sweat chloride values. When studying the same genotypes, CFTR function rescue by CFTR modulators in organoids correlated tightly with mean improvement in lung function (r2=0.90) and sweat chloride (r2=0.95) reported in clinical trials. We identified candidate genotypes for modulator therapy, such as E92K, Q237E, R334W and L159S. Based on organoid results, two subjects started modulator treatment: one homozygous for complex allele Q359K-T360K, and the second with mutation E60K. Both subjects had major clinical benefit. Conclusions: Measurements of residual CFTR function and rescue of function by CFTR modulators in intestinal organoids correlate closely with clinical data. Our results for reference genotypes concur with previous results. CFTR function measured in organoids can be used to guide precision medicine in patients with CF, positioning organoids as a potential in vitro model to bring treatment to patients carrying rare CFTR mutations.},

Mutation of the lysine residue in the ``Walker A'' motif of either the first nucleotide binding fold (CFTRK464A) or the second nucleotide binding fold (CFTRK1250A) inhibited the ATPase activity of the purified intact CFTR protein significantly, by greater than 50\%. This finding suggests that the two nucleotide binding folds of CFTR are functioning cooperatively in catalysis. However, the rate of channel gating was only significantly inhibited in one of these purified mutants, CFTRK1250A, suggesting that ATPase activity may not be tightly coupled to channel gating as previously hypothesized.},

  abstract = {Structural information is required to define the molecular basis for chloride conduction through CFTR (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator). Towards this goal, we expressed MSD2, the second of the two MSDs (membrane-spanning domains) of CFTR, encompassing residues 857\textendash 1158 in Sf9 cells using the baculovirus system. In Sf9 plasma membranes, MSD2 migrates as expected for a dimer in non-dissociative PAGE, and confers the appearance of an anion permeation pathway suggesting that dimeric MSD2 mediates anion flux. To assess directly the function and quaternary structure of MSD2, we purified it from Sf9 cells by virtue of its polyhistidine tag and nickel affinity. Reconstitution of MSD2 into liposomes conferred a 4,4{${'}$}-di-isothiocyanostilbene-2,2{${'}$}-disulphonate-inhibitable, chloride-selective electrodiffusion pathway. Further, this activity is probably mediated directly by MSD2 as reaction of its single cysteine residue (Cys866) with the thiol modifying reagent, N{$\alpha$}(3-maleimidylpropionyl)biocytin, inhibited chloride flux. Only MSD2 dimers were labelled by N{$\alpha$}(3-maleimidylpropionyl)biocytin, supporting the idea that only dimeric MSD2 can mediate anion flux. As a further test of this hypothesis, we conducted a second purification procedure, wherein purified dimeric and monomeric MSD2 proteins were reconstituted separately. Only proteoliposomes containing stable MSD2 dimers mediated chloride electrodiffusion, providing direct evidence that dimeric MSD2 mediates chloride channel function. In summary, we have shown that the second membrane domain of CFTR can be purified and functionally reconstituted as a chloride channel, providing a tool for probing the structural basis of chloride conduction through CFTR.},

  abstract = {The two NBDs (nucleotide-binding domains) of ABC (ATP-binding-cassette) proteins function in a complex to mediate ATPase activity and this activity has been linked to their regulated transport activity. A similar model has been proposed for CFTR (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator), the chloride channel defective in cystic fibrosis, wherein ATP binding and hydrolysis regulate the channel gate. Recently, it was shown that the individual NBDs isolated from CFTR primarily mediate adenylate kinase activity, raising the possibility that this activity may also contribute to gating of the CFTR channel. However, this present study shows that whereas the isolated NBDs exhibit adenylate kinase activity, the full-length purified and reconstituted CFTR protein functions as an ATPase, arguing that the enzymatic activity of the NBDs is dependent on their molecular context and appropriate domain-domain assembly. As expected, the disease-causing mutant bearing a mutation in the ABC signature motif, CFTR-G551D, exhibited a markedly reduced ATPase activity. Furthermore, mutation of the putative catalytic base in CFTR caused a reduction in ATPase activity, with the CFTR-E1371Q mutant supporting a low level of residual activity. Neither of these mutants exhibited detectable adenylate kinase activity. Together, these findings support the concept that the molecular mechanism of action of CFTR is dependent on ATP binding and hydrolysis, and that the structure of prokaryotic ABC ATPases provide a useful template for understanding their mechanism of action. \textcopyright{} The Authors.},

We evaluate the method using 12 test sets of congeneric series for which experimental binding data is available in the literature, as well as the structure of one member of the series bound to the protein. Ligands are "docked" by superimposing a common stem fragment among the compounds in the series using a crystal complex from the Protein Data Bank and sampling the conformational space of the variable region. Our results show good correlation between our predicted rankings and the experimental data for cases in which binding affinities differ by at least 1 order of magnitude. For 11 out of 12 cases, \textbackslash textgreater90\% of such ligand pairs could be correctly ranked, while for the remaining case, Factor Xa, 76\% of such pairs were correctly ranked. A small number of compounds could not be docked using the current protocol because of the large size of functional groups that could not be accommodated by a rigid receptor. CPU requirements for the method, involving CPU minutes per ligand, are modest compared with more rigorous methods that use similar force fields, such as free energy perturbation. We also benchmark the scoring function using series of ligands bound to the same protein within the CSAR data set. We demonstrate that energy minimization of ligands in the crystal structures is critical to obtain any correlation with experimentally determined binding affinities. \textcopyright{} 2011 American Chemical Society.}

  abstract = {Missense DNA variants have variable effects upon protein function. Consequently, interpreting their pathogenicity is challenging, especially when they are associated with disease variability. To determine the degree to which functional assays inform interpretation, we analyzed 48 CFTR missense variants associated with variable expressivity of cystic fibrosis (CF). We assessed function in a native isogenic context by evaluating CFTR mutants that were stably expressed in the genome of a human airway cell line devoid of endogenous CFTR expression. 21 of 29 variants associated with full expressivity of the CF phenotype generated \textbackslash textless10\% wild-type CFTR (WT-CFTR) function, a conservative threshold for the development of life-limiting CF lung disease, and five variants had moderately decreased function (10\% to {$\sim$}25\% WT-CFTR). The remaining three variants in this group unexpectedly had \textbackslash textgreater25\% WT-CFTR function; two were higher than 75\% WT-CFTR. As expected, 14 of 19 variants associated with partial expressivity of CF had \textbackslash textgreater25\% WT-CFTR function; however, four had minimal to no effect on CFTR function (\textbackslash textgreater75\% WT-CFTR). Thus, 6 of 48 (13\%) missense variants believed to be disease causing did not alter CFTR function. Functional studies substantially refined pathogenicity assignment with expert annotation and criteria from the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and Association for Molecular Pathology. However, four algorithms (CADD, REVEL, SIFT, and PolyPhen-2) could not differentiate between variants that caused severe, moderate, or minimal reduction in function. In the setting of variable expressivity, these results indicate that functional assays are essential for accurate interpretation of missense variants and that current prediction tools should be used with caution.},

ShK peptide from a sea anemone is one of the most potent blockers of Kv1.3 but its application as a therapeutic agent for autoimmune diseases is limited by its lack of selectivity against other Kv channels, in particular Kv1.1. Accurate models of Kv1.x-ShK complexes suggest that specific charge mutations on ShK could considerably enhance its specificity for Kv1.3. Here we evaluate the K18A mutation on ShK, and calculate the change in binding free energy associated with this mutation using the path-independent free energy perturbation and thermodynamic integration methods, with a novel implementation that avoids convergence problems. To check the accuracy of the results, the binding free energy differences were also determined from path-dependent potential of mean force calculations. The two methods yield consistent results for the K18A mutation in ShK and predict a 2 kcal/mol gain in Kv1.3/Kv1.1 selectivity free energy relative to wild-type peptide. Functional assays confirm the predicted selectivity gain for ShK[K18A] and suggest that it will be a valuable lead in the development of therapeutics for autoimmune diseases.},

This anti-tumor candidate is a selective small-molecule inhibitor of NAE which is conjugated to cullin protein on Cullin-RING ligases (CRLs). This covalent modification actives cullin complex to recruit an ubiquitin-charged E2 and leads to downstream target protein polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. MLN4924, which can form a covalent adduct with NEDD8, and block NAE at the first step in this pathway, has shown anti-tumor activity in many kinds of cancer cell lines and also xenograft models, including lung cancer, colon cancer, melanoma and lymphoma. The anti-tumor activity of MLN4924 results from inactivation of CLRs, which causes DNA re-replication and inhibition of nuclear factor (NF)-{$\kappa$}B signaling, thus leading to cancer cell death. A mutation can reduce the enzyme's sensitivity to MLN4924. Verma et al. in 2013 studied on molecular dynamics simulation of a mutant A171T and consequently found out that this mutation reduce MLN4924 interaction with DNA Binding site of enzyme as a result of reduction of enzyme affinity to ATP. One year later, in 2014, Wei Xu et al. carried out a research on inhibitor resistant cell lines and revealed that a couple of mutations so called Y352H and I310N leads to enzyme resistance to MLN4924 inhibitor, interestingly, the cause reported was the increase of enzyme affinity to ATP. As in Wei Xu et al. experiment the molecular dynamics simulation was not considered, present study is conducted to identify enzyme mutation mechanism by molecular dynamics approach using advantages of Gromacs software version 4.5.6.},

The gene defect was first described 25 years ago and much progress has been made since then in our understanding of how CFTR mutations cause disease and how this can be addressed therapeutically. CFTR is a transmembrane protein that transports ions across the surface of epithelial cells. CFTR dysfunction affects many organs; however, lung disease is responsible for the vast majority of morbidity and mortality in patients with cystic fibrosis. Prenatal diagnostics, newborn screening and new treatment algorithms are changing the incidence and the prevalence of the disease. Until recently, the standard of care in cystic fibrosis treatment focused on preventing and treating complications of the disease; now, novel treatment strategies directly targeting the ion channel abnormality are becoming available and it will be important to evaluate how these treatments affect disease progression and the quality of life of patients.

During cardiac ischemia, the buildup of acidic metabolites results in decreased intracellular and extracellular pH, which can reach as low as 6.0 to 6.5. The resulting tissue acidosis exacerbates ischemic injury and significantly affects cardiac function. Methods: We used genetic and pharmacologic methods to investigate the role of acid-sensing ion channel 1a (ASIC1a) in cardiac IRI at the cellular and whole-organ level. Human induced pluripotent stem cell\textendash derived cardiomyocytes as well as ex vivo and in vivo models of IRI were used to test the efficacy of ASIC1a inhibitors as pre- and postconditioning therapeutic agents. Results: Analysis of human complex trait genetics indicates that variants in the ASIC1 genetic locus are significantly associated with cardiac and cerebrovascular ischemic injuries. Using human induced pluripotent stem cell\textendash derived cardiomyocytes in vitro and murine ex vivo heart models, we demonstrate that genetic ablation of ASIC1a improves cardiomyocyte viability after acute IRI. Therapeutic blockade of ASIC1a using specific and potent pharmacologic inhibitors recapitulates this cardioprotective effect. We used an in vivo model of myocardial infarction and 2 models of ex vivo donor heart procurement and storage as clinical models to show that ASIC1a inhibition improves post-IRI cardiac viability. Use of ASIC1a inhibitors as preconditioning or postconditioning agents provided equivalent cardioprotection to benchmark drugs, including the sodium-hydrogen exchange inhibitor zoniporide. At the cellular and whole organ level, we show that acute exposure to ASIC1a inhibitors has no effect on cardiac ion channels regulating baseline electromechanical coupling and physiologic performance. Conclusions: Our data provide compelling evidence for a novel pharmacologic strategy involving ASIC1a blockade as a cardioprotective therapy to improve the viability of hearts subjected to IRI.},

These functions vary from control of hydration of outward-facing epithelial surfaces to conservation and regulation of total body volume. In the most general context, salt and fluid absorption is driven by active Na+ absorption. Cl- is absorbed passively through various available paths in response to the electrical driving force that results from active Na+ absorption. Absorption of salt creates a concentration gradient that causes water to be absorbed passively, provided the epithelium is water permeable. Key differences notwithstanding, the transport elements used for salt and fluid absorption are broadly similar in diverse epithelia, but the regulation of these elements enables salt absorption to be tailored to very different physiological needs. Here we focus on salt absorption by exocrine glands and airway epithelia. In cystic fibrosis, salt and fluid absorption by gland duct epithelia is effectively prevented by the loss of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). In airway epithelia, salt and fluid absorption persists, in the absence of CFTR-mediated Cl- secretion. The contrast of these tissue-specific changes in CF tissues is illustrative of how salt and fluid absorption is differentially regulated to accomplish tissue-specific physiological objectives., In cystic fibrosis, salt and fluid absorption are effectively prevented in gland duct epithelia, but persist in airway epithelia.},

CFTR contains two membrane-spanning domains (MSDs), two nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs), and a regulatory domain, and its channel assembly requires multiple interdomain contacts. The most common CF-causing mutation, F508del, occurs in NBD1 and results in misfolding and premature degradation of F508del-CFTR. VX-809 is an investigational CFTR corrector that partially restores CFTR function in people who are homozygous for F508del-CFTR. To identify the folding defect(s) in F508del-CFTR that must be repaired to treat CF, we explored the mechanism of VX-809 action. VX-809 stabilized an N-terminal domain in CFTR that contains only MSD1 and efficaciously restored function to CFTR forms that have missense mutations in MSD1. The action of VX-809 on MSD1 appears to suppress folding defects in F508del-CFTR by enhancing interactions among the NBD1, MSD1, and MSD2 domains. The ability of VX-809 to correct F508del-CFTR is enhanced when combined with mutations that improve F508del-NBD1 interaction with MSD2. These data suggest that the use of VX-809 in combination with an additional CFTR corrector that suppresses folding defects downstream of MSD1 may further enhance CFTR function in people with F508del-CFTR. \textcopyright{} 2013 Ren et al.},

  abstract = {Here we propose the reweighted autoencoded variational Bayes for enhanced sampling (RAVE) method, a new iterative scheme that uses the deep learning framework of variational autoencoders to enhance sampling in molecular simulations. RAVE involves iterations between molecular simulations and deep learning in order to produce an increasingly accurate probability distribution along a low-dimensional latent space that captures the key features of the molecular simulation trajectory. Using the Kullback-Leibler divergence between this latent space distribution and the distribution of various trial reaction coordinates sampled from the molecular simulation, RAVE determines an optimum, yet nonetheless physically interpretable, reaction coordinate and optimum probability distribution. Both then directly serve as the biasing protocol for a new biased simulation, which is once again fed into the deep learning module with appropriate weights accounting for the bias, the procedure continuing until estimates of desirable thermodynamic observables are converged. Unlike recent methods using deep learning for enhanced sampling purposes, RAVE stands out in that (a) it naturally produces a physically interpretable reaction coordinate, (b) is independent of existing enhanced sampling protocols to enhance the fluctuations along the latent space identified via deep learning, and (c) it provides the ability to easily filter out spurious solutions learned by the deep learning procedure. The usefulness and reliability of RAVE is demonstrated by applying it to model potentials of increasing complexity, including computation of the binding free energy profile for a hydrophobic ligand\textendash substrate system in explicit water with dissociation time of more than 3 min, in computer time at least twenty times less than that needed for umbrella sampling or metadynamics.}

Impaired autophagy induced mitochondrial unfolding protein response and NLRP3 inflammasome activation, contributing to hyperinflammation.

Mitochondrial calcium uniporter inhibition rectified autophagy and alleviated the inflammatory response in vitro and in vivo, resulting in a valid therapeutic strategy for cystic fibrosis pulmonary disease.}

Quantum chemical calculations are employed to determine the binding energy of neutral and anionic urea to copper oxide and elemental copper, the main complexes believed to participate in surface cleaning of this DES. The possibility of the existence of urea anions in this deep eutectic solvent is studied in terms of the possibility of proton transfer taking place. Results show that the anion formation is stabilized in a dielectric and that the relative binding of neutral and anionic urea to copper oxide is similar whereas elemental Cu significantly favors binding with the urea anion. This work also shows that the hydrogen bond interactions of the urea with the chloride ion maintains an open cluster structure as suggested by experiment and that proton transfer can occur with increasing temperature or with metallic complex formation leading to more aggressive solvent action. \textcopyright{} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

The accuracy of these calculations depends on the force field quality and on the thoroughness of configuration sampling. Sampling is an obstacle in simulations due to the frequent appearance of kinetic bottlenecks in the free energy landscape. Very often this difficulty is circumvented by enhanced sampling techniques. Typically, these techniques depend on the introduction of appropriate collective variables that are meant to capture the system's degrees of freedom. In ligand binding, water has long been known to play a key role, but its complex behaviour has proven difficult to fully capture. In this paper we combine machine learning with physical intuition to build a non-local and highly efficient water-describing collective variable. We use it to study a set of host-guest systems from the SAMPL5 challenge. We obtain highly accurate binding free energies and good agreement with experiments. The role of water during the binding process is then analysed in some detail.},

A series of in vitro experiments conducted early in the development of ivacaftor indicated ivacaftor and metabolites may have the potential to inhibit cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C8, CYP2C9, CYP3A, and CYP2D6, as well as P-glycoprotein (P-gp). Based on these results, a series of clinical drug-drug interaction (DDI) studies were conducted to evaluate the effect of ivacaftor on sensitive substrates of CYP2C8 (rosiglitazone), CYP3A (midazolam), CYP2D6 (desipramine), and P-gp (digoxin). In addition, a DDI study was conducted to evaluate the effect of ivacaftor on a combined oral contraceptive, as this is considered an important comedication in CF patients. The results indicate ivacaftor is a weak inhibitor of CYP3A and P-gp, but has no effect on CYP2C8 or CYP2D6. Ivacaftor caused non-clinically significant increases in ethinyl estradiol and norethisterone exposure. Based on these results, caution and appropriate monitoring are recommended when concomitant substrates of CYP2C9, CYP3A and/or P-gp are used during treatment with ivacaftor, particularly drugs with a narrow therapeutic index, such as warfarin.},

It has been unclear, however, whether any physical model (force field) used in MD simulations accurately describes both folded and disordered proteins. Here, we select a benchmark set of 21 systems, including folded and disordered proteins, simulate these systems with six state-of-the-art force fields, and compare the results to over 9,000 available experimental data points. We find that none of the tested force fields simultaneously provided accurate descriptions of folded proteins, of the dimensions of disordered proteins, and of the secondary structure propensities of disordered proteins. Guided by simulation results on a subset of our benchmark, however, we modified parameters of one force field, achieving excellent agreement with experiment for disordered proteins, while maintaining state-of-the-art accuracy for folded proteins. The resulting force field, a99SB-disp, should thus greatly expand the range of biological systems amenable to MD simulation. A similar approach could be taken to improve other force fields.},

Further simulations with small molecules chosen to modify these interactions yielded binding affinities and key structural features of binding consistent with subsequent NMR experiments, suggesting the potential for MD-based strategies to facilitate the rational design of small molecules that bind with disordered proteins.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Ivacaftor is generally safe and effective in patients aged 2 years and older who have cystic fibrosis and specific CFTR mutations. We assessed its use in children aged 12 to {$<$}24 months. METHODS: The ARRIVAL study is a phase 3, single-arm, two-part, multicentre study. Eligible children were aged 12 to {$<$}24 months at enrolment and had a confirmed diagnosis of cystic fibrosis and a CFTR gating mutation on at least one allele and could participate in one or both parts of the study. Children received 50 mg (bodyweight 7 to {$<$}14 kg) or 75 mg (bodyweight {$\geq$}14 to {$<$}25 kg) ivacaftor orally every 12 h. In study part A, children received ivacaftor for 3 days plus one morning. In study part B, children received 24 weeks of treatment. Children were enrolled into part A at seven sites in Australia (one site), the UK (one), and the USA (five) and into part B at 13 sites in Australia (two sites), Canada (one), the UK (three), and the USA (seven). Primary endpoints were pharmacokinetics (part A) and safety (parts A and B) in children who received at least one dose of ivacaftor. Secondary endpoints in part B were pharmacokinetics in children who received at least one dose of ivacaftor and absolute change from baseline in sweat chloride concentration. We also explored changes in growth parameters and markers of pancreatic function. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02725567. FINDINGS: Children aged 12 to {$<$}24 months were enrolled between Aug 25, 2016, and Nov 1, 2017. Seven children were enrolled in part A, of whom five received 50 mg and two received 75 mg ivacaftor. All completed treatment. Of 19 children enrolled in part B, including one from part A, all received 50 mg ivacaftor and 18 completed treatment (one withdrew because of difficulty with blood draws). All children received at least one dose of ivacaftor. Pharmacokinetics indicated exposure was similar to that in children aged 2 to {$<$}6 years and adults. No children discontinued because of adverse events or safety findings. In part A, three (43\%) of seven children had treatment-emergent adverse events, all of which were mild and deemed not to be or unlikely to be related to ivacaftor. By 24 weeks in part B, treatment-emergent adverse events had been reported in 18 (95\%) of 19 children, of which most were mild or moderate and the most frequent was cough (14 [74\%] children). Two children in part B had four serious adverse events: one had constipation (possibly related to ivacaftor), distal intestinal obstruction syndrome, and eczema herpeticum, and one had persistent cough, all needing hospital admission. In five (28\%) of 18 children aspartate or alanine aminotransferase concentrations rose to more than three times the upper limit of normal (to more than eight times in two children with concurrent infections). At week 24, the mean absolute change from baseline in sweat chloride concentration was -73{$\cdot$}5 (SD 17{$\cdot$}5) mmol/L. Growth parameters for age were normal at baseline and at week 24. At week 24, concentrations of faecal elastase-1 had increased and concentrations of immunoreactive trypsinogen had decreased from baseline. Mean serum lipase and amylase were raised at baseline and rapidly decreased after treatment was started. INTERPRETATION: Ivacaftor was generally safe and well tolerated in children aged 12 to {$<$}24 months for up to 24 weeks and was associated with rapid and sustained reductions in sweat chloride concentrations. Improvements in biomarkers of pancreatic function suggest that ivacaftor preserves exocrine pancreatic function if started early. The study is continuing in infants younger than 12 months.

  abstract = {Biomolecular simulations are typically performed in an aqueous environment where the number of ions remains fixed for the duration of the simulation, generally with either a minimally neutralizing ion environment or a number of salt pairs intended to match the macroscopic salt concentration. In contrast, real biomolecules experience local ion environments where the salt concentration is dynamic and may differ from bulk. The degree of salt concentration variability and average deviation from the macroscopic concentration remains, as yet, unknown. Here, we describe the theory and implementation of a Monte Carlo osmostat that can be added to explicit solvent molecular dynamics or Monte Carlo simulations to sample from a semigrand canonical ensemble in which the number of salt pairs fluctuates dynamically during the simulation. The osmostat reproduce the correct equilibrium statistics for a simulation volume that can exchange ions with a large reservoir at a defined macroscopic salt concentration. To achieve useful Monte Carlo acceptance rates, the method makes use of nonequilibrium candidate Monte Carlo (NCMC) moves in which monovalent ions and water molecules are alchemically transmuted using short nonequilibrium trajectories, with a modified Metropolis-Hastings criterion ensuring correct equilibrium statistics for an {$\Delta\mu$}, N, p, T) ensemble. We demonstrate how typical protein (DHFR and the tyrosine kinase Src) and nucleic acid (Drew-Dickerson B-DNA dodecamer) systems exhibit salt concentration distributions that significantly differ from fixed-salt bulk simulations and display fluctuations that are on the same order of magnitude as the average.},

  abstract = {The free energy profile of a Na+ ion along the axis of the gramicidin A dimer channel is calculated by molecular dynamics simulations. A cylindrical system is used that is based on a detailed atomic model of the gramicidin dimer, which is solvated at both ends of the channel and surrounded by a simplified model membrane. The entire system consists of 967 atoms and is treated with cylindrical periodic boundary conditions. The gramicidin channel was modeled from the right-handed head-to-head 0-helix dimer determined experimentally by two-dimensional NMR. Simulations were made to estimate the free energy profile in three regions: the transition from bulk-like solvation to single file, the single-file region at the entrance of the channel, and the intermonomer junction of the dimer channel. In each region, approximate corrections are introduced to account for hysteresis effects in the simulations. Binding sites are found at the extremities of the channel in agreement with experiment. The principal energy barrier is at the entrance of the channel in the single-file region. No large activation energy barrier is introduced by the dehydration process, because the transformation from bulk to single-file solvation is progressive and takes place over a distance of 5-6 A. The free energy simulation results obtained in this paper are joined with those calculated from a periodic model of the interior of the pore to construct an approximate free energy profile of the entire channel system.},

  abstract = {The goal of this review is to establish a broad and rigorous theoretical framework to describe ion permeation through biological channels. This framework is developed in the context of atomic models on the basis of the statistical mechanical projection-operator formalism of Mori and Zwanzig. The review is divided into two main parts. The first part introduces the fundamental concepts needed to construct a hierarchy of dynamical models at different level of approximation. In particular, the potential of mean force (PMF) as a configuration-dependent free energy is introduced, and its significance concerning equilibrium and non-equilibrium phenomena is discussed. In addition, fundamental aspects of membrane electrostatics, with a particular emphasis on the influence of the transmembrane potential, as well as important computational techniques for extracting essential information from all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are described and discussed. The first part of the review provides a theoretical formalism to `translate ' the information from the atomic structure into the familiar language of phenomenological models of ion permeation. The second part is aimed at reviewing and contrasting results obtained in recent computational studies of three very different channels : the gramicidin A (gA) channel, which is a narrow one-ion pore (at moderate concentration), the KcsA channel from Streptomyces lividans, which is a narrow multi-ion pore, and the outer membrane matrix porin F (OmpF) from Escherichia coli, which is a trimer of three b-barrel subunits each forming wide aqueous multi-ion pores. Comparison with experiments demonstrates that current computational models are approaching semi-quantitative accuracy and are able to provide significant insight into the microscopic mechanisms of ion conduction and selectivity. We conclude that all-atom MD with explicit water molecules can represent important structural features of complex biological channels accurately, including such features as the location of ion-binding sites along the permeation pathway. We finally discuss the broader issue of the validity of ion permeation models and an outlook to the future.},

It is shown that a simulation with a constant external electric field applied in the direction normal to the membrane is equivalent to the influence of surrounding infinite baths maintained to a voltage difference via ion-exchanging electrodes connected to an electromotive force. It is also shown that the linearly-weighted displacement charge within the simulation system tracks the net flow of charge through the external circuit comprising the electromotive force and the electrodes. Using a statistical mechanical reduction of the degrees of freedom of the external system, three distinct theoretical routes are formulated and examined for the purpose of characterizing the free energy of a protein embedded in a membrane that is submitted to a voltage difference. The W-route is constructed from the variations in the voltage-dependent potential of mean force along a reaction path connecting two conformations of the protein. The Q-route is based on the average displacement charge as a function of the conformation of the protein. Finally, the G-route considers the relative charging free energy of specific residues, with and without applied membrane potentials. The theoretical formulation is illustrated with a simple model of an ion crossing a vacuum slab surrounded by two aqueous bulk phases and with a fragment of the voltage-sensor of the KvAP potassium channel. \textcopyright{} 2008 by the Biophysical Society.}

  abstract = {The kinetics of a dynamical system comprising two metastable states is formulated in terms of a finite-time propagator in phase space (position and velocity) adapted to the underdamped Langevin equation. Dimensionality reduction to a subspace of collective variables yields familiar expressions for the propagator, committor, and steady-state flux. A quadratic expression for the steady-state flux between the two metastable states can serve as a robust variational principle to determine an optimal approximate committor expressed in terms of a set of collective variables. The theoretical formulation is exploited to clarify the foundation of the string method with swarms-of-trajectories, which relies on the mean drift of short trajectories to determine the optimal transition pathway. It is argued that the conditions for Markovity within a subspace of collective variables may not be satisfied with an arbitrary short time-step and that proper kinetic behaviors appear only when considering the effective propagator for longer lag times. The effective propagator with finite lag time is amenable to an eigenvalue-eigenvector spectral analysis, as elaborated previously in the context of position-based Markov models. The time-correlation functions calculated by swarms-of-trajectories along the string pathway constitutes a natural extension of these developments. The present formulation provides a powerful theoretical framework to characterize the optimal pathway between two metastable states of a system.},

As case in point, we present data concerning P67L mutation of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), a defect carried by a small number of individuals with CF and sometimes attributed to a channel conductance abnormality. Findings from our laboratory and others establish that P67L causes protein misfolding, disrupts maturation, confers gating defects, is thermally stable, and exhibits near normal conductance. These results provide one framework by which rare CF alleles such as P67L can be more comprehensively profiled vis-\`a-vis molecular pathogenesis. We also demonstrate that emerging CF treatments - ivacaftor and lumacaftor - can mediate pronounced pharmacologic activation of P67L CFTR. Infrequent CF alleles are often improperly characterized, in part, due to the small numbers of patients involved. Moreover, access to new personalized treatments among patients with ultra-orphan genotypes has been limited by difficulty arranging phase III clinical trials, and off-label prescribing has been impaired by high drug cost and difficulty arranging third party reimbursement. Rare CFTR mutations such as P67L are emblematic of the challenges to "precision" medicine, including use of the best available mechanistic knowledge to treat patients with unusual forms of disease.},

This rare mutation (reported in {$<$}300 patients worldwide) responds robustly to CFTR correctors, such as lumacaftor and tezacaftor, with rescue in model systems that far exceed what can be achieved for the archetypical CFTR mutant F508del. However, the specific molecular consequences of the P67L mutation are poorly characterized. In this study, we conducted biochemical measurements following low-temperature growth and/or intragenic suppression, which suggest a mechanism underlying P67L that (1) shares key pathogenic features with F508del, including off-pathway (non-native) folding intermediates, (2) is linked to folding stability of nucleotide-binding domains 1 and 2, and (3) demonstrates pharmacologic rescue that requires domains in the carboxyl half of the protein. We also investigated the "lasso" helices 1 and 2, which occur immediately upstream of P67. Based on limited proteolysis, pulse chase, and molecular dynamics analysis of full-length CFTR and a series of deletion constructs, we argue that P67L and other maturational processing (class 2) defects impair the integrity of the lasso motif and confer misfolding of downstream domains. Thus, amino-terminal missense variants elicit a conformational change throughout CFTR that abrogates maturation while providing a robust substrate for pharmacologic repair.},

Here, we review some of the recent studies on aqueous ILs that concern the role of water in altering the behavior of ILs in general and in case of biomolecules solvated in ILs. The different structural and dynamic effects caused by water have been highlighted. We discuss the different modes of IL interaction that are responsible for stabilization and destabilization of proteins and enzymes followed by examples of water effect on this. The role of water in the case of nucleic acid storage in ILs, an area which has mostly been underrated, also has been emphasized. Our discussions highlight the fact that the effects of water on IL behavior are not general and are highly dependent on the nature of the IL under consideration. Overall, we aim to draw attention to the significance of water dynamics in the aqueous IL solutions, a better understanding of which can help in developing superior storage materials for application purposes.},

The CFTR anion channel plays a major role in regulating both secretion and absorption in a diverse range of epithelial tissues, including the airways, the GI and reproductive tracts, sweat and salivary glands. It is not surprising then that defects in CFTR function are linked to disease, including life-threatening secretory diarrhoeas, such as cholera, as well as the inherited disease, cystic fibrosis (CF), one of the most common life-limiting genetic diseases in Caucasian populations. More recently, CFTR dysfunction has also been implicated in the pathogenesis of acute pancreatitis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and the hyper-responsiveness in asthma, underscoring its fundamental role in whole body health and disease. CFTR regulates many mechanisms in epithelial physiology, such as maintaining epithelial surface hydration and regulating luminal pH. Indeed, recent studies have identified luminal pH as an important arbiter of epithelial barrier function and innate defence, particularly in the airways and GI tract. In this chapter, we will illustrate the different operational roles of CFTR in epithelial function by describing its characteristics in three different tissues: the airways, the pancreas, and the sweat gland.},

Here, we investigated the impact of two common differentiation media on phenotypic, transcriptomic, and physiological features of CF and non-CF epithelia. Cellular architecture and density were strongly impacted by the choice of medium. RNA-sequencing revealed a shift in airway cell lineage; one medium promoting differentiation into club and goblet cells whilst the other enriched the growth of ionocytes and multiciliated cells. Pathway analysis identified differential expression of genes involved in ion and fluid transport. Physiological assays (intracellular/extracellular pH, Ussing chamber) specifically showed that ATP12A and CFTR function were altered, impacting pH and transepithelial ion transport in CF hAECs. Importantly, the two media differentially affected functional responses to CFTR modulators. We argue that the effect of growth conditions should be appropriately determined depending on the scientific question and that our study can act as a guide for choosing the optimal growth medium for specific applications.},

The three-dimensional (3D) model is obtained by optimally satisfying spatial restraints derived from the alignment and expressed as probability density functions (pdfs) for the features restrained. For example, the probabilities for main-chain conformations of a modelled residue may be restrained by its residue type, main-chain conformation of an equivalent residue in a related protein, and the local similarity between the two sequences. Several such pdfs are obtained from the correlations between structural features in 17 families of homologous proteins which have been aligned on the basis of their 3D structures. The pdfs restrain C{$\alpha$}-C{$\alpha$} distances, main-chain N-O distances, main-chain and side-chain dihedral angles. A smoothing procedure is used in the derivation of these relationships to minimize the problem of a sparse database. The 3D model of a protein is obtained by optimization of the molecular pdf such that the model violates the input restraints as little as possible. The molecular pdf is derived as a combination of pdfs restraining individual spatial features of the whole molecule. The optimization procedure is a variable target function method that applies the conjugate gradients algorithm to positions of all non-hydrogen atoms. The method is automated and is illustrated by the modelling of trypsin from two other serine proteinases. \textcopyright{} 1993 Academic Press Limited.},

In a recent work [Tiwary and Parrinello, Phys. Rev.

Ensuring though that these two criteria are met may not always be simple. Here we build on the fact that the times of escape from a long-lived metastable state obey Poisson statistics. This allows us to identify quantitative measures of trustworthiness of our calculation. We test our method on a few paradigmatic examples. \textcopyright{} 2014 American Chemical Society.},

Epithelial morphogenesis was accompanied by a major shift from sphingomyelin to glycosphingolipid, together with an increase in plasmalogen, phosphatidylethanolamine, and cholesterol content, whereas the opposite changes took place during an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. Moreover, during polarization, the sphingolipids became longer, more saturated, and more hydroxylated as required to generate an apical membrane domain that serves as a protective barrier for the epithelial sheet.},

  abstract = {Animal venoms are a rich source of bioactive peptides that efficiently modulate key receptors and ion channels involved in cellular excitability to rapidly neutralize their prey or predators. As such, they have been a wellspring of highly useful pharmacological tools for decades. Besides targeting ion channels, some venom peptides exhibit strong cytotoxic activity and preferentially affect cancer over healthy cells. This is unlikely to be driven by an evolutionary impetus, and differences in tumor cells and the tumor microenvironment are probably behind the serendipitous selectivity shown by some venom peptides. However, strategies such as bioconjugation and nanotechnologies are showing potential to improve their selectivity and potency, thereby paving the way to efficiently harness new anticancer mechanisms offered by venom peptides. This review aims to highlight advances in nano- and chemotherapeutic tools and prospective anti-cancer drug leads derived from animal venom peptides. A strategy that has been gaining increased application for the study of the conformation, dynamics, orientation, and physicochemical properties of peptides is labeling with the paramagnetic amino acid TOAC. This approach was used to gain a deeper understanding on the mechanism of action of the antimicrobial peptide tritrpticin (TRP3). TRP3 was labeled with TOAC at the N-terminus (prior to V1, TOAC0-TRP3) or internally (replacing P5, TOAC5-TRP3). Functional studies showed that labeling led to peptides with higher activity against Gram-positive bacteria and lower hemolytic activity with respect to TRP3. Peptide-induced model membranes permeabilization and ion channel-like activity studies corroborated the functional assays qualitatively, showing higher activity of the peptides against negatively charged membranes, which had the purpose of mimicking bacterial membranes. TOAC presented a greater freedom of motion at the N-terminus than at the internal position, as evinced by EPR spectra. EPR and fluorescence spectra reported on the peptides conformational properties, showing acquisition of a more packed conformation in the presence of the secondary structure-inducing solvent, TFE. CD studies showed that TOAC0-TRP3 acquires a conformation similar to that of TRP3, both in aqueous solution and in TFE, while TOAC5-TRP3 presents a different conformation in all environments. While the mechanism of action of TRP3 was impacted to some extent by TOAC labeling at the N-terminus, it did change upon replacement of P5 by TOAC. The results demonstrated that TOAC-labeling could be used to modulate TRP3 activity and mechanism of action and, more importantly, the critical role of P5 for TRP3 pore formation. In this article we review current understanding of basic principles for the folding of membrane proteins, focusing on the more abundant alpha-helical class. Membrane proteins, vital to many biological functions and implicated in numerous diseases, fold into their active conformations in the complex environment of the cell bilayer membrane. While many membrane proteins rely on the translocon and chaperone proteins to fold correctly, others can achieve their functional form in the absence of any translation apparatus or other aides. Nevertheless, the spontaneous folding process is not well understood at the molecular level. Recent findings suggest that helix fraying and loop formation may be important for overall structure, dynamics and regulation of function. Several types of membrane helices with ionizable amino acids change their topology with pH. Additionally we note that some peptides, including many that are rich in arginine, and a particular analogue of gramicidin, are able passively to translocate across cell membranes. The findings indicate that a final protein structure in a lipid-bilayer membrane is sequence-based, with lipids contributing to stability and regulation. While much progress has been made toward understanding the folding process for alpha-helical membrane proteins, it remains a work in progress. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Emergence of Complex Behavior in Biomembranes edited by Marjorie Longo. The three-state kinetic model developed in our previous paper (R. Guidelli and L. Becucci, 2016), which explains all the main features of experimental current-voltage curves of peptide ion channels at conventional bilayer lipid membranes (BLMs), is extended to explain some still unsettled features of the corresponding voltage-step current-time (I-t) curves. To this end, the time dependence of the open probability of peptide ion channels during the first few seconds from the instant of the voltage step, before the attainment of its steady-state value expressed by the well-known one-sided Boltzmann equation, is taken into account. This approach explains the reason for the different behavior of the experimental sigmoidal I-t curves with respect to the wholly concave downward ones; the frequent occurrence of concave downward I-t curves characterized by a time course describable by a sum of two exponential functions is also justified. On the other hand, the three-state kinetic model disproves the validity of the experimental procedure aiming at estimating the gating charge of peptide ion channels from the initial stage of the time derivative of ON and OFF ionic currents, commonly justified by an unproved analogy with gating currents of potassium ion channels. The mechanism of ion channel formation in bilayer lipid membranes is discussed by comparing the experimental behavior of current-time and current-voltage curves with the predictions of a model accounting for the kinetics of nucleation of monomeric units and growth of the resulting channel-forming aggregates. A distinction is made between channel-forming peptides, whose dipoles are oriented normal to the membrane plane by the electric field, and large proteins aggregating into Na+, K+, and Ca2 + channels, which have a constant transmembrane disposition and merely reorient each other with a parallel side-by-side motion under the influence of the electric field. This difference explains why the open probability, as expressed in both cases by the one-sided Boltzmann equation, attains the unit value at accessible depolarizations in protein ion channels, whereas it is much less than unity in peptide ion channels. Biological activities of bombolitins from Bombus ardens, B. consobrinus, B. terrestris and B. ussurensis (bombolitins A, C, T and U, respectively) were examined using hemolytic, anti-microbial, anti-fungal and anti-tumor activity assays. Among the four bombolitins tested, bombolitin T showed the highest hemolytic and anti-tumor activities. All bombolitins exhibited strong anti-microbial and anti-fungal activities, and bombolitin A specifically possessed the highest anti-microbial activity against the Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli. Circular dichroism spectrometry analysis revealed that all four bombolitins had over 61.7\% and 45.5\% of {$\alpha$}-helicity in 30 mM sodium dodecyl sulfate and 50\% trifluoroethanol buffers, respectively, which form lipid-membrane-mimicking environments. Bombolitin T showed the lowest IC50 values of 8.5 {$\mu$}M and 8.8 {$\mu$}M against SK-OV-3 and NIH-OVCAR-3 cell lines, respectively, after 72 h of treatment, but its relative hemolytic activity at a concentration of 200 {$\mu$}M was 2.3-fold higher than that of 0.1\% Triton X-100. To design selective anti-tumor peptides with reduced hemolytic activity, bombolitin T was chosen as a model to be modified by amino acid substitution. The lowest hemolytic activity was observed with the addition of a hydrophobic amino acid (Ile14) to the C-terminal end as well as the substitution of Ser10 and Leu12 with a hydrophobic amino acid (Leu) and positively charged amino acid (Lys), respectively. This finding implies that the balanced substitution of hydrophobic and positively charged amino acids could affect the cytotoxicity. This study provides new information on the properties of anti-tumor peptides in the venoms of bumblebees and the basic approaches for peptide design tools for the reduction of cytotoxicity.},

This definition becomes even more important as we try to link drug response to genetic variation, understand stratified clinical efficacy and safety, rationalize the differences between drugs in the same therapeutic class and predict drug utility in patient subgroups. However, drug targets are often poorly defined in the literature, both for launched drugs and for potential therapeutic agents in discovery and development. Here, we present an updated comprehensive map of molecular targets of approved drugs. We curate a total of 893 human and pathogen-derived biomolecules through which 1,578 US FDA-approved drugs act. These biomolecules include 667 human-genome-derived proteins targeted by drugs for human disease. Analysis of these drug targets indicates the continued dominance of privileged target families across disease areas, but also the growth of novel first-in-class mechanisms, particularly in oncology. We explore the relationships between bioactivity class and clinical success, as well as the presence of orthologues between human and animal models and between pathogen and human genomes. Through the collaboration of three independent teams, we highlight some of the ongoing challenges in accurately defining the targets of molecular therapeutics and present conventions for deconvoluting the complexities of molecular pharmacology and drug efficacy.},

Carboxy-terminal domains line the central ion pore, and the channel is closed by constrictions in the cytosol. A kinked helical beam and anchor domain link the Piezo repeats to the pore, and are poised to control gating allosterically.

  abstract = {High cost and high energy penalty for CO2uptake from flue gases are important obstacles in large-scale industrial applications, and developing efficient technology for CO2capture from technical and economic points is crucial. Ionic liquids (ILs) show the potential for CO2separation owing to their inherent advantages, and have been proposed as alternatives to overcome the drawbacks of conventional sorbents. Chemical modification of ILs to improve their performance in CO2absorption has received more attention. Deep eutectic solvents (DESs) as a new generation of ILs are considered as more economical alternatives to cope with the deficiencies of high cost and high viscosity of conventional ILs. This Review discusses the potential of functionalized ILs and DESs as CO2sorbents. Incorporation of CO2-philic functional groups, such as amine, in cation and/or anion moiety of ILs can promot their absorption capacity. In general, the functionalization of the anion part of ILs is more effective than the cation part. DESs represent favorable solvent properties and are capable of capturing CO2, but the research work is scarce and undeveloped compared to the studies conducted on ILs. It is possible to develop novel DESs with promising absorption capacity. However, more investigation needs to be carried out on the mechanism of CO2sorption of DESs to clarify how these novel sorbents can be adjusted and fine-tuned to be best tailored as optimized media for CO2capture.},

  abstract = {In insects, each olfactory sensory neuron expresses between one and three ligand-binding members of the olfactory receptor (OR) gene family, along with the highly conserved and broadly expressed Or83b co-receptor. The functional insect OR consists of a heteromeric complex of unknown stoichiometry but comprising at least one variable odorant-binding subunit and one constant Or83b family subunit. Insect ORs lack homology to G-protein-coupled chemosensory receptors in vertebrates and possess a distinct seven-transmembrane topology with the amino terminus located intracellularly. Here we provide evidence that heteromeric insect ORs comprise a new class of ligand-activated non-selective cation channels. Heterologous cells expressing silkmoth, fruitfly or mosquito heteromeric OR complexes showed extracellular Ca2+ influx and cation-non-selective ion conductance on stimulation with odorant. Odour-evoked OR currents are independent of known G-protein-coupled second messenger pathways. The fast response kinetics and OR-subunit-dependent K+ ion selectivity of the insect OR complex support the hypothesis that the complex between OR and Or83b itself confers channel activity. Direct evidence for odorant-gated channels was obtained by outside-out patch-clamp recording of Xenopus oocyte and HEK293T cell membranes expressing insect OR complexes. The ligand-gated ion channel formed by an insect OR complex seems to be the basis for a unique strategy that insects have acquired to respond to the olfactory environment.},

The expanding crypts undergo multiple crypt fission events, simultaneously generating villus-like epithelial domains that contain all differentiated types of cells. We have adapted the culture conditions to grow similar epithelial organoids from mouse colon and human small intestine and colon. Methods Based on the mouse small intestinal culture system, we optimized the mouse and human colon culture systems. Results Addition of Wnt3A to the combination of growth factors applied to mouse colon crypts allowed them to expand indefinitely. Addition of nicotinamide, along with a small molecule inhibitor of Alk and an inhibitor of p38, were required for long-term culture of human small intestine and colon tissues. The culture system also allowed growth of mouse Apc-deficient adenomas, human colorectal cancer cells, and human metaplastic epithelia from regions of Barrett's esophagus. Conclusions We developed a technology that can be used to study infected, inflammatory, or neoplastic tissues from the human gastrointestinal tract.

  abstract = {In the present study we report on interactions of and competition between monovalent ions for two DNA sequences in MD simulations. Efforts included the development and validation of parameters for interactions among the first-group monovalent cations, Li+, Na+, K+, and Rb+, and DNA in the Drude polarizable and additive CHARMM36 force fields (FF). The optimization process targeted gas-phase QM interaction energies of various model compounds with ions and osmotic pressures of bulk electrolyte solutions of chemically relevant ions. The optimized ionic parameters are validated against counterion condensation theory and buffer exchange\textendash atomic emission spectroscopy measurements providing quantitative data on the competitive association of different monovalent ions with DNA. Comparison between experimental and MD simulation results demonstrates that, compared to the additive CHARMM36 model, the Drude FF provides an improved description of the general features of the ionic atmosphere around DNA and leads to closer agreement with experiment on the ionic competition within the ion atmosphere. Results indicate the importance of extended simulation systems on the order of 25 \AA{} beyond the DNA surface to obtain proper convergence of ion distributions.},

  abstract = {The modeling of atomistic biomolecular simulations using kinetic models such as Markov state models (MSMs) has had many notable algorithmic advances in recent years. The variational principle has opened the door for a nearly fully automated toolkit for selecting models that predict the long time-scale kinetics from molecular dynamics simulations. However, one yet-unoptimized step of the pipeline involves choosing the features, or collective variables, from which the model should be constructed. In order to build intuitive models, these collective variables are often sought to be interpretable and familiar features, such as torsional angles or contact distances in a protein structure. However, previous approaches for evaluating the chosen features rely on constructing a full MSM, which in turn requires additional hyperparameters to be chosen, and hence leads to a computationally expensive framework. Here, we present a method to optimize the feature choice directly, without requiring the construction of the final kinetic model. We demonstrate our rigorous preprocessing algorithm on a canonical set of 12 fast-folding protein simulations and show that our procedure leads to more efficient model selection.}

Here we suggest S\textdegree (H(aq)+) = - 5.5 J K-1 mol-1 based on the thermodynamics of the dissociation of water. This assignment, in turn, corresponds to {$\Delta$}(hyd)H\textdegree (H+) = -1078 kJ mol-1 according to a self-consistent analysis of Krestov. Using these values, as a main result, the anions are more strongly hydrated than usually thought, in line with recent calculations. Only the group 1, 2, and 15 nobel gas ions are dealt with. For each series, the conventional enthalpies and entropies are linearly related to one another. From these linear free energy relationships (LFERs) a relationship between S\textdegree (H(aq)+) and {$\Delta$}(hyd)H\textdegree (H+) is derived. Further, a connection is detected between the Born radii r(B), calculated from the free energies of hydration, and the distances d, corresponding to the upper limits of the experimental first peak position of the ion-oxygen radial distribution curves, upon implication, in the case of a cation, the covalent radius r(cov) of oxygen, and in the case of an anion, the water radius r(water), d(cation-oxygen) - r(cov)(O) {$\simeq$} r(B) d(anion-oxygen) - r(water) {$\simeq$} r(B) Finally, from the differences between the enthalpies and free energies of hydration the temperature derivatives of the Born radii are determined.}

The disease is likely due to a toxic gain of function caused by the misfolding, oligomerization, and eventual aggregation of mutant SOD1, but it is not yet understood how the structurally diverse mutations result in a common disease phenotype. The behavior of the apo-monomer fALS-associated mutant protein A4V was explored using molecular-dynamics simulations to elucidate characteristic structural changes to the protein that may allow the mutant form to improperly associate with other monomer subunits. Simulations showed that the mutant protein is less stable than the WT protein overall, with shifts in residue-residue contacts that lead to destabilization of the dimer and metal-binding sites, and stabilization of nonnative contacts that leads to a misfolded state. These findings provide a unifying explanation for disparate experimental observations, allow a better understanding of alterations of residue contacts that accompany loss of SOD1 structural integrity, and suggest sites where compensatory changes may stabilize the mutant structure. \textcopyright{} 2009 by the Biophysical Society.},

  abstract = {Although protein based therapeutics is the fastest growing sector of the pharmaceutical industry, production costs remain incredibly high and rapid commercialization of new protein drug candidates are not being fully realized due to the presence of many barriers, namely the physical and chemical instabilities of proteins. Of these degradation pathways, protein aggregation is arguably the most common and troubling manifestation of protein instability, occurring in almost all phases of development. Protein aggregates are usually nonnative in structure, may exhibit reduced biological activity, and can remain soluble and/or precipitate from solution. In addition to reducing efficacy, if administered to a patient, aggregates can cause adverse reactions, such as immune response, sensitization, or even anaphylactic shock. Therefore, if even a small amount of aggregates form during formulation or storage, a product can be rendered unacceptable. Moreover, for the practical application of traditional and novel drug delivery techniques, protein based therapeutics must be formulated at relatively high concentrations and must remain stable for extended periods of time. The structural differences among various proteins are so significant, that the application of a universal stabilization strategy has not yet been successful, though the effects of common excipients are generally universal. The current approach toward stabilizing protein drugs against aggregation is by trial-and-error testing of different combinations of cosolutes (e.g. salts, sugars, surfactants, amino acids, etc.) using empirically derived heuristics. While ubiquitously used, this approach is inefficient and does not always enable the discovery of stable protein solution formulations. In response to this major problem, we have developed and tested a new class of excipients that has the potential for wide spread application as a universal stabilizer of protein therapeutics. When compared to other commonly used excipients, our novel excipients offer more than an order of magnitude improvement at suppressing the aggregation of a model protein. As a result, if used in formulations, the shelf life of a protein drug, at room or refrigerated temperatures, may be extended from a few weeks to several months or years. Furthermore, these excipients will likely be useful during production and purification for improving yield and lowering downstream purification costs.}

  abstract = {The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) anion channel is essential to maintain fluid homeostasis in key organs such as the lungs or the digestive systems. Functional impairment of CFTR due to mutation in the cftr gene lead to Cystic Fibrosis (CF) the most common lethal genetic disorder. Here we observe that the first nucleotide-binding domain (NBD1) of CFTR can spontaneously adopt an alternative conformation that departs from the canonical NBD fold previously observed for CFTR and other ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter proteins. Crystallography studies reveal that this conformation involves a topological reorganization of the {$\beta$}-subdomain of NBD1. This alternative state is adopted by wild-type CFTR in cells, where it leads to enhanced channel activity. Single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer microscopy shows that the equilibrium between the conformations is regulated by ATP binding. However, under destabilizing conditions, such as a the prominent disease-causing mutation F508el , this conformational flexibility enables unfolding of the {$\beta$}-subdomain. Our data indicate that in wild-type CFTR switching to this topologically-swapped conformation of NBD1 regulates channel function, but, in the presence of the F508del mutation, it allows domain misfolding and subsequent protein degradation. Our work provides a framework to design conformation-specific therapeutics to prevent noxious transitions.}

  abstract = {Time-lagged independent component analysis (tICA) is a widely used dimension reduction method for the analysis of molecular dynamics (MD) trajectories and has proven particularly useful for the construction of protein dynamics Markov models. It identifies those ``slow'' collective degrees of freedom onto which the projections of a given trajectory show maximal autocorrelation for a given lag time. Here we ask how much information on the actual protein dynamics and, in particular, the free energy landscape that governs these dynamics the tICA-projections of MD-trajectories contain, as opposed to noise due to the inherently stochastic nature of each trajectory. To answer this question, we have analyzed the tICA-projections of high dimensional random walks using a combination of analytical and numerical methods. We find that the projections resemble cosine functions and strongly depend on the lag time, exhibiting strikingly complex behavior. In particular, and contrary to previous studies of principal component projections, the projections change noncontinuously with increasing lag time. The tICA-projections of selected 1 {$\mu$}s protein trajectories and those of random walks are strikingly similar, particularly for larger proteins, suggesting that these trajectories contain only little information on the energy landscape that governs the actual protein dynamics. Further the tICA-projections of random walks show clusters very similar to those observed for the protein trajectories, suggesting that clusters in the tICA-projections of protein trajectories do not necessarily reflect local minima in the free energy landscape. We also conclude that, in addition to the previous finding that certain ensemble properties of nonconverged protein trajectories resemble those of random walks; this is also true for their time correlations.},

According to the 'extrathermodynamic' TATB hypothesis, such ions have identical free energies of transfer from water to any solvent. We find that this is not the case, because S- interacts better than S+ with water (by about 20 kcal mol-1), while S+ is better solvated by acetonitrile (by about 2 kcal mol-1) and chloroform (about 8 kcal mol-1) solvents. The importance of 'long-range' electrostatic interactions on the charge discrimination by solvent is demonstrated by the comparison of standard vs corrected methods to calculate: (i) the electrostatic potential at the centre of the solute; (ii) the interaction energies between the ions and the solvents; and (iii) the free energies of charging the neutral sphere S0 to S+ and S-, respectively. These conclusions are obtained with several solvent models and simulation conditions. The question of ion pairing for the S+S-, S+Cl- and S-Na+ pairs is also examined in the three solvents. Finally, simulations at a liquid-liquid water-chloroform interface represented explicitly, show that S+ and S- are highly surface active, although they do not possess, like classical surfactants, an amphiphilic topology. Adsorption at the interface is found with different methodologies and at different ion concentrations. These results are important in the context of the 'TATB hypothesis', and for our understanding of solvation of large hydrophobic ions in pure liquids or in heterogeneous liquid environments.

This method has been used in conjunction with Markov State Models (MSMs) to provide estimates of the characteristic eigenprocesses contained in a simulation (e.g., protein folding, ligand binding). Here, we extend the tICA method using the kernel trick to arrive at nonlinear solutions. This is a substantial improvement as it allows for kernel-tICA (ktICA) to provide estimates of the characteristic eigenprocesses directly without building an MSM.},

  abstract = {The infrared (IR) spectra of polypeptides are dominated by the so-called amide bands. Because they originate from the strongly polar and polarizable amide groups (AGs) making up the backbone, their spectral positions sensitively depend on the local electric fields. Aiming at accurate computations of these IR spectra by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, which derive atomic forces from a hybrid quantum and molecular mechanics (QM/MM) Hamiltonian, here we consider the effects of solvation in bulk liquid water on the amide bands of the AG model compound N-methyl-acetamide (NMA). As QM approach to NMA we choose grid-based density functional theory (DFT). For the surrounding MM water, we develop, largely based on computations, a polarizable molecular mechanics (PMM) model potential called GP6P, which features six Gaussian electrostatic sources (one induced dipole, five static partial charge distributions) and, therefore, avoids spurious distortions of the DFT electron density in hybrid DFT/PMM simulations. Bulk liquid GP6P is shown to have favorable properties at the thermodynamic conditions of the parameterization and beyond. Lennard-Jones (LJ) parameters of the DFT fragment NMA are optimized by comparing radial distribution functions in the surrounding GP6P liquid with reference data obtained from a "first-principles" DFT-MD simulation. Finally, IR spectra of NMA in GP6P water are calculated from extended DFT/PMM-MD trajectories, in which the NMA is treated by three different DFT functionals (BP, BLYP, B3LYP). Method-specific frequency scaling factors are derived from DFT-MD simulations of isolated NMA. The DFT/PMM-MD simulations with GP6P and with the optimized LJ parameters then excellently predict the effects of aqueous solvation and deuteration observed in the IR spectra of NMA. As a result, the methods required to accurately compute such spectra by DFT/PMM-MD also for larger peptides in aqueous solution are now at hand.}

This paper aims to review the changes in the incidence and survival of CF and to assess the impact of the discovery of the responsible gene (the CFTR gene) on these changes. The incidence of CF appears to be decreasing in most countries and patient survival, which can be monitored by various indicators, has improved substantially, with an estimated median age of survival of approximately50 years today. Cloning of the CFTR gene 30 years ago and efforts to identify its many mutations have greatly improved the management of CF. Implementation of genetic screening policies has enabled earlier diagnosis (via newborn screening), in addition to prevention within families or in the general population in some areas (via prenatal diagnosis, family testing or population carrier screening). In the past decade, in-depth knowledge of the molecular bases of CF has also enabled the emergence of CFTR modulator therapies which have led to major clinical advances in the treatment of CF. All of these phenomena have contributed to changing the face of CF. The advent of targeted therapies has paved the way for precision medicine and is expected to further improve survival in the coming years.},

This new set of rules is derived from a quantitative analysis of the drug binding and transport properties of P-glycoprotein. We further discuss the role of P-glycoprotein in immune surveillance and cell metabolism.

  abstract = {To examine the contribution of the large cytoplasmic loops of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) to channel activity, the three point-mutations (S945L, H949Y, G970R) were characterized that have been detected in the third cytoplasmic loop (CL3, residues 933-990) in patients with cystic fibrosis. Chinese hamster ovary cell lines stably expressing wild-type CFTR or mutant G970R-CFTR yielded polypeptides with apparent masses of 170 kDa as the major products, whereas the major products of mutants S945L-CFTR and H949Y-CFTR had apparent masses of 150 kDa. The 150-kDa forms of CFTR were sensitive to endoglycosidase H digestion, indicating that these mutations interfered with maturation of the protein. Increased levels of mature CFTR (170 kDa) could be obtained for mutant H949Y when cells were grown at a lower temperature (26 \textdegree C) or incubated in the presence of 10\% glycerol. For all mutants, the open probability (P0) of the CFTR channels was significantly altered. S945L-CFTR and G970R-CFTR showed a severe reduction in the P0, whereas the H949Y mutation doubled the P0 relative to wild-type. The changes in P0 predominantly resulted from an alteration of the mean burst durations which suggests that CL3 is involved in obtaining and/or maintaining stability of the open state. In addition, mutants S945L and G970R had current-voltage relationships that were not completely linear over the range {$\pm$}80 mV, but showed slight outward rectification. The fact that CL3 mutations can have subtle effects on channel conductance indicates that this region may be physically close to the inner mouth of the pore.}

  abstract = {Protein structure prediction can be used to determine the three-dimensional shape of a protein from its amino acid sequence1. This problem is of fundamental importance as the structure of a protein largely determines its function2; however, protein structures can be difficult to determine experimentally. Considerable progress has recently been made by leveraging genetic information. It is possible to infer which amino acid residues are in contact by analysing covariation in homologous sequences, which aids in the prediction of protein structures3. Here we show that we can train a neural network to make accurate predictions of the distances between pairs of residues, which convey more information about the structure than contact predictions. Using this information, we construct a potential of mean force4 that can accurately describe the shape of a protein. We find that the resulting potential can be optimized by a simple gradient descent algorithm to generate structures without complex sampling procedures. The resulting system, named AlphaFold, achieves high accuracy, even for sequences with fewer homologous sequences. In the recent Critical Assessment of Protein Structure Prediction5 (CASP13)\textemdash a blind assessment of the state of the field\textemdash AlphaFold created high-accuracy structures (with template modelling (TM) scores6 of 0.7 or higher) for 24 out of 43 free modelling domains, whereas the next best method, which used sampling and contact information, achieved such accuracy for only 14 out of 43 domains. AlphaFold represents a considerable advance in protein-structure prediction. We expect this increased accuracy to enable insights into the function and malfunction of proteins, especially in cases for which no structures for homologous proteins have been experimentally determined7.},

According to platonism, mathematical objects (as well as mathematical relations and structures) exist and are abstract; that is, they are not located in space and time and have no causal connection with us. Although this characterization of abstract objects is purely negative\textemdash indicating what such objects are not\textemdash in the context of mathematics it captures the crucial features the objects in questions are supposed to have. According to nominalism, mathematical objects (including, henceforth, mathematical relations and structures) do not exist, or at least they need not be taken to exist for us to make sense of mathematics. So, it is the nominalist's burden to show how to interpret mathematics without the commitment to the existence of mathematical objects. This is, in fact, a key feature of nominalism: those who defend the view need to show that it is possible to yield at least as much explanatory work as the platonist obtains, but invoking a meager ontology. To achieve that, nominalists in the philosophy of mathematics forge interconnections with metaphysics (whether mathematical objects do exist), epistemology (what kind of knowledge of these entities we have), and philosophy of science (how to make sense of the successful application of mathematics in science without being committed to the existence of mathematical entities). These interconnections are one of the sources of the variety of nominalist views.},

  abstract = {Deletion of phenylalanine-508 (Phe-508) from the N-terminal nucleotide-binding domain (NBD1) of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), a member of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter family, disrupts both its folding and function and causes most cystic fibrosis. Most mutant nascent chains do not pass quality control in the ER, and those that do remain thermally unstable, only partially functional, and are rapidly endocytosed and degraded. Although the lack of the Phe-508 peptide backbone diminishes the NBD1 folding yield, the absence of the aromatic side chain is primarily responsible for defective CFTR assembly and channel gating. However, the site of interdomain contact by the side chain is unknown as is the high-resolution 3D structure of the complete protein. Here we present a 3D structure of CFTR, constructed by molecular modeling and supported biochemically, in which Phe-508 mediates a tertiary interaction between the surface of NBD1 and a cytoplasmic loop (CL4) in the C-terminal membrane-spanning domain (MSD2). This crucial cytoplasmic membrane interface, which is dynamically involved in regulation of channel gating, explains the known sensitivity of CFTR assembly to many disease-associated mutations in CL4 as well as NBD1 and provides a sharply focused target for small molecules to treat CF. In addition to identifying a key intramolecular site to be repaired therapeutically, our findings advance understanding of CFTR structure and function and provide a platform for focused biochemical studies of other features of this unique ABC ion channel. \textcopyright{} 2008 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.},

Various approximations and corrections are introduced to enable their calculation in small systems, which, however, raises issues of robustness. We show that solvation free energies of ions can be calculated using the spherical boundary conditions without introducing any corrections at the boundary via a buffer zone. The results are shown to converge for a droplet size of 21 \AA{} and are independent of the parameters used for confining water or restraining the ion. The proposed method thus resolves the robustness issues in solvation free energy calculations of ions and can be used with confidence to determine force field parameters from such calculations. We apply the method to calculate the solvation free energies of the side chain analogs of charged amino acids. Tests using periodic boundary conditions show that similar results are also obtained in that case.},

Recent improvement enabled pharmacologic therapy aiming at restoring mutated CFTR expression and function. CFTR ``modulators'' have revolutionised the CF therapeutic landscape, particularly the last approved Trikafta. This drug-combination is indicated by FDA and very recently by EMA for genotypes carrying at least one copy of CFTR with F508del pathogenic variant. However, several genotypes, are not eligible for Trikafta treatment, yet. Materials/patients and methods We exploited an innovative cellular approach allowing highly efficient in vitro-expansion of airway epithelial stem cells (AESC) through conditional reprogramming (CRC) from nasal brushing of CF patients. This approach, coupled to development of AESC-derived personalised disease models, as organoids and air liquid interface (ALI) cultures, revealed highly suitable for CFTR pharmacological-testing. Results and answer to the question We fully validated the experimental models and implemented the CFTR functional assays and biochemical CFTR protein characterisation, that allowed to evaluate the efficacy of clinically available modulators in restoring CFTR maturation and function of each patient-derived ``avatar'' (theratyping). F508del homozygous genotypes, used as controls, confirmed the higher clinical activity of Trikafta in comparison with older modulators. Trikafta showed its efficacy also on three rare genotypes previously not eligible for modulators-treatment, opening the way to clinical translation. Finally, encouraging results for innovative drug combinations were also obtained.},

Although it is common practice to synthesize these fluids in a moisture-controlled environment, as moisture is generally considered to have an impact on their properties, there are no systematic studies on this. We herein examine the effects of water on Reline, a Type-III DES composed of urea and choline chloride. Experiments were performed to obtain the physical properties of aqueous Reline solution. We observed moderate changes in density, speed of sound, refractive index, and pH with increasing water fraction; however, the change in viscosity and conductivity was strong and exponential. In addition, molecular dynamics simulations were performed to analyze the intermolecular interactions of Reline and aqueous Reline solutions. The simulations primarily present the significance of urea-anion interaction to explain the low melting point of the DES. In the presence of water, the anion is preferentially hydrated as compared to urea or the cation. More interestingly, simulations help to classify the effects of water into different regimes. At low water fractions (\textbackslash textless5\%) the urea-urea interactions are enhanced, as is revealed through the hydrogen bond analysis. Beyond 25\% water fractions, the components of Reline are individually hydrated and have high diffusivity, which is further reflected in the change in transport properties. The results presented herein provide valuable information on aqueous Reline solutions both in terms of experimental data and molecular insights, which in turn, we believe, might assist in developing further applications of Reline and other related DESs. \textcopyright{} the Partner Organisations 2014.}

  abstract = {To further investigate the effect of single amino acid substitution on the structure and function of the gramicidin channel, an analogue of gramicidin A (GA) has been synthesized in which Trp15 is replaced by Gly in the critical aqueous interface and cation binding region. The structure of Gly15-GA incorporated into SDS micelles has been determined using a combination of 2D-NMR spectroscopy and molecular modeling. Like the parent GA, Gly15-GA forms a dimeric channel composed of two single-stranded, right-handed {$\beta$}6.3-helices joined by hydrogen bonds between their N-termini. The replacement of Trp15 by Gly does not have a significant effect on backbone structure or side chain conformations with the exception of Trp11 in which the indole ring is rotated away from the channel axis. Measurement of the equilibrium binding constants and {$\Delta$}G for the binding of monovalent cations to GA and Gly15-GA channels incorporated into PC vesicles using 205Tl NMR spectroscopy shows that monovalent cations bind much more weakly to the Gly15-GA channel entrance than to GA channels. Utilizing the magnetization inversion transfer NMR technique, the transport of Na+ ions through GA and Gly15-GA channels incorporated into PC/PG vesicles has been investigated. The Gly15 substitution produces an increase in the activation enthalpy of transport and thus a significant decrease in the transport rate of the Na+ ion is observed. The single-channel appearances show that the conducting channels have a single, well-defined structure. Consistent with the NMR results, the single-channel conductances are reduced by 30\% and the lifetimes by 70\%. It is concluded that the decrease in cation binding, transport, and conductance in Gly15-GA results from the removal of the Trp15 dipole and, to a lesser extent, the change in orientation of Trp11.},

  abstract = {Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) are ubiquitous biomolecular processes that are central to virtually all aspects of cellular function. Identifying small molecules that modulate specific disease-related PPIs is a strategy with enormous promise for drug discovery. The design of drugs to disrupt PPIs is challenging, however, because many potential drug-binding sites at PPI interfaces are ``cryptic'': When unoccupied by a ligand, cryptic sites are often flat and featureless, and thus not readily recognizable in crystal structures, with the geometric and chemical characteristics of typical small-molecule binding sites only emerging upon ligand binding. The rational design of small molecules to inhibit specific PPIs would benefit from a better understanding of how such molecules bind at PPI interfaces. To this end, we have conducted unbiased, all-atom MD simulations of the binding of four small-molecule inhibitors (SP4206 and three SP4206 analogs) to interleukin 2 (IL2)\textemdash which performs its function by forming a PPI with its receptor\textemdash without incorporating any prior structural information about the ligands' binding. In multiple binding events, a small molecule settled into a stable binding pose at the PPI interface of IL2, resulting in a protein\textendash small-molecule binding site and pose virtually identical to that observed in an existing crystal structure of the IL2-SP4206 complex. Binding of the small molecule stabilized the IL2 binding groove, which when the small molecule was not bound emerged only transiently and incompletely. Moreover, free energy perturbation (FEP) calculations successfully distinguished between the native and non-native IL2\textendash small-molecule binding poses found in the simulations, suggesting that binding simulations in combination with FEP may provide an effective tool for identifying cryptic binding sites and determining the binding poses of small molecules designed to disrupt PPI interfaces by binding to such sites.},

  abstract = {The most representative member of the Ras subfamily is its HRas isoform. Ras proteins being GTPases, possess an intrinsic activity to hydrolyze the GTP molecule to GDP. During the transition phases, between active and inactive states, P-loop and switch regions show maximum variations. Various hot-spot Ras mutants (G12~V, A59G, Q61L etc) have been reported, that limit the protein's conformation in the permanent active state. In the present study, we aim to explore the structural dynamics of one such crucial mutant of Ras namely A59G which belongs to the conserved Switch II region of the protein. Approximately {$\sim$}15~{$\mu$}s of Classical Molecular Dynamics (CMD) simulations have been carried out on the mutant and wild-type complexes. Further, a metadynamics simulation of 500~ns was also carried out, which suggests an energy barrier of {$\sim$}9.56~kcal/mol between wild-type and mutant conformation. We demonstrate the role of water molecule in maintaining the required interaction networks in the pre-hydrolysis state, its impact on A59G mutation, distinct orientation of the Gln61 residue in two conformations, disruption of crucial Gly60 and {$\gamma$} phosphate and the change in the Switch II region. The outcome of our study captures the pre-hydrolysis state of the HRas protein. It also establishes the fact that this mutation makes the movement of Switch II region and the conserved DXXGQ motif highly constrained, which is known to be an important requirement for hydrolysis. This suggests that the A59G mutation may decrease the rate of intrinsic hydrolysis as well as GAP-mediated hydrolysis.},

Nonsense suppression (also termed readthrough) therapy restores protein function by selectively suppressing translation termination at PTCs. Poor efficacy of current readthrough agents prompted us to search for better compounds. An NMD-sensitive NanoLuc readthrough reporter was used to screen 771,345 compounds. Among the 180 compounds identified with readthrough activity, SRI-37240 and its more potent derivative SRI-41315, induce a prolonged pause at stop codons and suppress PTCs associated with cystic fibrosis in immortalized and primary human bronchial epithelial cells, restoring CFTR expression and function. SRI-41315 suppresses PTCs by reducing the abundance of the termination factor eRF1. SRI-41315 also potentiates aminoglycoside-mediated readthrough, leading to synergistic increases in CFTR activity. Combining readthrough agents that target distinct components of the translation machinery is a promising treatment strategy for diseases caused by PTCs.},

The development of small-molecule modulators that directly interact with CFTR to aid in protein folding (``correctors'') and/or increase channel function (``potentiators'') have proven to be highly effective in the therapeutic treatment of CF. Notably, incorporation of the next-generation CFTR corrector, elexacaftor, into a triple combination therapeutic (marketed as Trikafta) has shown tremendous clinical promise in treating CF caused by F508del-CFTR. Here, we report on a newly-described role of elexacaftor as a CFTR potentiator. We explore the acute and chronic actions, pharmacology, and efficacy of elexacaftor as a CFTR potentiator in restoring function to multiple classes of CFTR mutations. We demonstrate that the potentiating action of elexacaftor exhibits multiplicative synergy with the established CFTR potentiator ivacaftor in rescuing multiple CFTR class defects, indicating that a new combination therapeutic of ivacaftor and elexacaftor could have broad impact on CF therapies.},

In this work, we demonstrate how all-atom molecular dynamics simulations using recent developments grounded in statistical mechanics can provide a detailed mechanistic rationale for such variances. We discover dissociation mechanisms for the anti-cancer drug Imatinib (Gleevec) against wild-type and the N368S mutant of Abl kinase. We show how this point mutation triggers far-reaching changes in the protein's flexibility and leads to a different, much faster, drug dissociation pathway.

Using the probability theory, we derive an atomic distance-dependent statistical potential from a sample of native structures that does not depend on any adjustable parameters (Discrete Optimized Protein Energy, or DOPE). DOPE is based on an improved reference state that corresponds to noninteracting atoms in a homogeneous sphere with the radius dependent on a sample native structure; it thus accounts for the finite and spherical shape of the native structures. The DOPE potential was extracted from a nonredundant set of 1472 crystallographic structures. We tested DOPE and five other scoring functions by the detection of the native state among six multiple target decoy sets, the correlation between the score and model error, and the identification of the most accurate non-native structure in the decoy set. For all decoy sets, DOPE is the best performing function in terms of all criteria, except for a tie in one criterion for one decoy set. To facilitate its use in various applications, such as model assessment, loop modeling, and fitting into cryo-electron microscopy mass density maps combined with comparative protein structure modeling, DOPE was incorporated into the modeling package MODELLER-8.},

DESs share many of the remarkable properties of ionic liquids (ILs) while being more inexpensive; furthermore, and in addition to their fundamental scientific interest, the systems modeled here are relevant to dye-sensitized solar cells and gas separations. Our results show that glycerol can form stable hydrogen bonds with the oxygen atoms in the rutile walls, which account for {$\sim$}86\% of the total number of hydrogen bonds involving DES species (choline, iodide, and glycerol) in the first layers (near the rutile walls), and for {$\sim$}24\% of the total hydrogen bonds observed for the DES inside a rutile pore of width H = 5.2 nm. As a result, in these systems, the rutile walls are coated by glycerol layers that are almost depleted of ions, have a liquid structure that departs from that of the bulk DES, and have very slow dynamics. In contrast, for DES inside graphitic pores, all species are present in the first layers near the carbon walls, the local liquid structure everywhere is similar to that of a bulk DES, and the overall dynamics are faster than those observed inside rutile pores of the same pore size; however, the DES species in the center of both rutile and graphitic pores have comparable mobilities. When the pore size is reduced, a larger proportion of the hydrogen bonds involve the walls (in the case of a rutile pore), the overall dynamics of the confined DES become slower, and in general the hydrogen bonds formed are present during longer times in the simulation trajectories. These observations are in general similar to the results obtained by us for the IL [EMIM+][TFMSI-] inside the same rutile and graphitic pores; however, both of the IL ions are present in the layers near the walls, and the ions in the center of a rutile pore have dynamics that were 2-4 times slower than those observed for the same ions in the center of a graphitic pore.}

Although cystic fibrosis (CF) is caused by mutations in a single gene encoding CFTR11,12, the disease has a variable clinical phenotype13,14. The most common mutation associated with cystic fibrosis, deletion of a phenylalanine at position 508 (frequency, 67\%), is associated with severe disease15-17. But some missense mutations, for example ones in which arginine is replaced by histidine at residue at 117 (R117H; 0.8\%), tryptophan at 334 (0.4\%), or proline at 347 (0.5\%), are associated with milder disease15,17,18. These missense mutations affect basic residues located at the external end of the second (M2) and in the sixth (M6) putative membrane-spanning sequences. Here we report that, when expressed in heterologous epithelial cells, all three mutants were correctly processed and generated cyclic AMP-regulated apical Cl- currents. Although the macroscopic current properties were normal, the amount of current was reduced. Patch-clamp analysis revealed that all three mutants had reduced single-channel conductances. In addition, R117H showed altered sensitivity to external pH and had altered single-channel kinetics. These results explain the quantitative decrease in macroscopic Cl- current, and suggest that R117, R334 and R347 contribute to the pore of the CFTR Cl - channel. Our results also suggest why R117H, R334W and R347P produce less severe clinical disease and have implications for our understanding of cystic fibrosis. \textcopyright{} 1993 Nature Publishing Group.},

It is located predominantly in the apical membrane of epithelia where it mediates transepithelial salt and liquid movement. Dysfunction of CFTR causes the genetic disease cystic fibrosis. The CFTR is composed of five domains: two membrane-spanning domains (MSDs), two nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs), and a regulatory (R) domain. Here we review the structure and function of this unique channel, with a focus on how the various domains contribute to channel function. The MSDs form the channel pore, phosphorylation of the R domain determines channel activity, and ATP hydrolysis by the NBDs controls channel gating. Current knowledge of CFTR structure and function may help us understand better its mechanism of action, its role in electrolyte transport, its dysfunction in cystic fibrosis, and its relationship to other ABC transporters.}

The current version (AMOEBA-2013) utilizes permanent electrostatic multipole moments through the quadrupole at each atom, and explicitly treats polarization effects in various chemical and physical environments. The atomic multipole electrostatic parameters for each amino acid residue type are derived from high-level gas phase quantum mechanical calculations via a consistent and extensible protocol. Molecular polarizability is modeled via a Thole-style damped interactive induction model based upon distributed atomic polarizabilities. Inter- and intramolecular polarization is treated in a consistent fashion via the Thole model. The intramolecular polarization model ensures transferability of electrostatic parameters among different conformations, as demonstrated by the agreement between QM and AMOEBA electrostatic potentials, and dipole moments of dipeptides. The backbone and side chain torsional parameters were determined by comparing to gas-phase QM (RI-TRIM MP2/CBS) conformational energies of dipeptides and to statistical distributions from the Protein Data Bank. Molecular dynamics simulations are reported for short peptides in explicit water to examine their conformational properties in solution. Overall the calculated conformational free energies and J-coupling constants are consistent with PDB statistics and experimental NMR results, respectively. In addition, the experimental crystal structures of a number of proteins are well maintained during molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. While further calculations are necessary to fully validate the force field, initial results suggest the AMOEBA polarizable multipole force field is able to describe the structure and energetics of peptides and proteins, in both gas-phase and solution environments.},

All conversions were fully automated from the originally prepared AMBER input files using a combination of the ParmEd and InterMol conversion programs. We find that the energy calculations for all molecular dynamics engines for this molecular set agree to better than 0.1~\% relative absolute energy for all energy components, and in most cases an order of magnitude better, when reasonable choices are made for different cutoff parameters. However, there are some surprising sources of statistically significant differences. Most importantly, different choices of Coulomb's constant between programs are one of the largest sources of discrepancies in energies. We discuss the measures required to get good agreement in the energies for equivalent starting configurations between the simulation programs, and the energy differences that occur when simulations are run with program-specific default simulation parameter values. Finally, we discuss what was required to automate this conversion and comparison.},

Here we show that inherited, disease-causing mutations located within the first nucleotide-binding domain (NBD1) of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) have distinct effects on nascent polypeptides. Two of these mutations (A455E and L558S) delay compaction of the nascent NBD1 during a critical window of synthesis. The observed folding defect is highly dependent on nascent chain length as well as its attachment to the ribosome. Moreover, restoration of the NBD1 cotranslational folding defect by second site suppressor mutations also partially restores folding of full-length CFTR. These findings demonstrate that nascent folding intermediates can play an important role in disease pathogenesis and thus provide potential targets for pharmacological correction.},

Three primer formats are commonly used; nonoverlapping, partially overlapping and fully overlapping primers, and here we describe the use of nonoverlapping primers for introduction of a point mutation. Use of such a primer setup in the PCR reaction, with one of the primers containing the desired mismatch mutation, results in the amplification of a linear, double-stranded, mutated product. Methylated template DNA is removed from the nonmethylated PCR product by DpnI digestion and the PCR product is then phosphorylated by polynucleotide kinase treatment before being recircularized by ligation, and transformed to E. coli.

Here we aimed to characterize two ultra-rare mutations - 1717-2A~{$>~$}G (c.1585-2A~{$>~$}G) and S955P (p.Ser955Pro) - as case studies for personalized medicine. Methods Patient-derived rectal biopsies and intestinal organoids from two individuals with each of these mutations and F508del (p.Phe508del) in the other allele were used to assess CFTR function, response to modulators and RNA splicing pattern. In parallel, we used cellular models to further characterize S955P independently of F508del and to assess its response to CFTR modulators. Results Results in both rectal biopsies and intestinal organoids from both patients evidence residual CFTR function. Further characterization shows that 1717-2A~{$>~$}G leads to alternative splicing generating {$<$}1\% normal CFTR mRNA and that S955P affects CFTR gating. Finally, studies in organoids predict that both patients are responders to VX-770 alone and even more to VX-770 combined with VX-809 or VX-661, although to different levels. Conclusion This study demonstrates the high potential of personalized medicine through theranostics to extend the label of approved drugs to patients with rare mutations.},

Therefore, biomarkers reliably predicting the benefit from CFTR modulator therapies are essential to find effective drugs for PwCF through personalized approaches termed theranostics. Here, we assess CFTR basal function and the individual responses to CFTR modulators in primary human nasal epithelial (pHNE) cells from PwCF carrying rare mutations and compare these measurements with those in native rectal biopsies and intestinal organoids, respectively, in the same individual. The basal function in pHNEs shows good correlation with CFTR basal function in rectal biopsies. In parallel, CFTR rescue in pHNEs by CFTR modulators correlates to that in intestinal organoids. Altogether, results show that pHNEs are a bona fide theranostic model to assess CFTR rescue by CFTR modulator drugs, in particular for PwCF and rare mutations.},

  abstract = {Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a lethal, genetic disease found in particular in humans of European origin which is caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) chloride channel. The search for CF therapies acting by modulating the impaired function of mutant CFTR will be greatly advanced by high resolution structures of CFTR in different states. To date, two medium resolution electron microscopy (EM) structures of CFTR are available (one of a distant zebrafish (Danio rerio) CFTR ortholog and one of human CFTR). The two models are nearly identical to one another, and both correspond to the inward-facing, nucleotide binding domains (NBDs) separated, closed state of the channel. In addition, lower resolution structural data are available for human CFTR in an alternative conformation which likely features associated NBDs and thus geometrically resembles the conducting state of the channel. Multiple homology models of human CFTR in multiple states have been developed over the years, yet their correspondence to the existing structural information is unexplored. In this work we use molecular dynamics flexible fitting (MDFF) simulations to refine two previously described CFTR models based on the available cryo-EM map of the human protein. This map was recorded in the absence of ATP and consequently represents closed-state CFTR yet its features likely correspond to an NBD associated conformation of the protein. Accordingly, the resulting models feature dimerized NBDs yet with no membrane traversing pore. Moreover, the open probability of the new models as deduced from the MDFF trajectories is significantly lower than that deduced from control MD trajectories initiated from the starting models. We propose that the new models correspond to a CFTR conformation which to date was largely unexplored yet is one that is relevant to the gating cycle of the protein. In particular this conformation may participate in rapid channel opening and closing through small allosteric movements controlled by nucleotide binding and dissociation events. Analyzing the resulting trajectories (and not only the final models as is usually the case), we demonstrate that the refined models have good stereochemical properties and are also in favorable agreement with multiple experimental data. Moreover, despite different starting points, the final models share many common features. Finally, we propose that the combination of high resolution cryo-EM maps, which are currently emerging from multiple laboratories, and MDFF simulations will be of value for the development of yet more reliable CFTR models as well as for the identification of binding sites for CFTR modulators.}

A large number of CFTR mutations cause cystic fibrosis. Since recent breakthrough in targeted pharmacotherapy, CFTR mutants with impaired gating are candidates for stimulation by potentiator drugs. Thus, understanding the molecular pathology of individual mutations has become important. The relatively common R117H mutation affects an extracellular loop, but nevertheless causes a strong gating defect. Here, we identify a hydrogen bond between the side chain of arginine 117 and the backbone carbonyl group of glutamate 1124 in the cryo-electronmicroscopic structure of phosphorylated, ATP-bound CFTR. We address the functional relevance of that interaction for CFTR gating using macroscopic and microscopic inside-out patch-clamp recordings. Employing thermodynamic double-mutant cycles, we systematically track gating-state-dependent changes in the strength of the R117-E1124 interaction. We find that the H-bond is formed only in the open state, but neither in the short-lived `flickery' nor in the long-lived `interburst' closed state. Loss of this H-bond explains the strong gating phenotype of the R117H mutant, including robustly shortened burst durations and strongly reduced intraburst open probability. The findings may help targeted potentiator design.},

In total, 166 variants have been reported on approximately 3700 Asian CF chromosomes. The frequency of F508del among Asians is low compared with Caucasians. Recent in vitro studies have shown promise of small molecule correction and potentiation of 45 different CFTR variants.

Although human airway epithelial likely play a key role in controlling the quantity and composition of the respiratory tract fluid, evidence for such a role is not available. To obtain such knowledge, we measured fluid and electrolyte transport by cultured human nasal epithelia. Under basal conditions we found that epithelia absorbed Na+ and fluid; both processes were inhibited by addition of amiloride to the mucosal surface. These data suggest that active Na+ absorption is responsible for fluid absorption. Interestingly, Na+ absorption was not accompanied by the net absorption of Cl-; some other anion accompanied Na+. The combination of cAMP agonists and mucosal amiloride stimulated the secretion of NaCl-rich fluid. But surprisingly, the response to cAMP agonists in the absence of amiloride showed substantial intersubject variability: cAMP stimulated fluid secretion across some epithelia, for others, cAMP stimulated fluid absorption. The explanation for the differences in response is uncertain, but we speculate that the magnitude of apical membrane Na+ conductance may modulate the direction of fluid transport in response to cAMP. We also found that airway epithelial secrete H+ and absorb K+ under basal conditions; both processes were inhibited by cAMP agonists. Because the H+/K(+)-ATPase inhibitor, SCH 28080, inhibited K+ absorption, an apical membrane H+/K(+)-ATPase may be at least partly responsible for K+ and H+ transport. However, H+/K+ exchange could not entirely account for the luminal acidification. The finding that cAMP agonists inhibited luminal acidification may be explained by the recent finding that cAMP increases apical HCO3- conductance. These results provide new insights into how the intact airway epithelium may modify the composition of the respiratory tract fluid.},

It was discovered recently that surface localization of CFTR is stabilized by an interaction between the CFTR N terminus and the multidomain cytoskeletal protein filamin. The details of the CFTR-filamin interaction, however, are unclear. Using x-ray crystallography, we show how the CFTR N terminus binds to immunoglobulin-like repeat 21 of filamin A (FlnA-Ig21). CFTR binds to {$\beta$}-strands C and D of FlnA-Ig21 using backbone-backbone hydrogen bonds, a linchpin serine residue, and hydrophobic side-chain packing. We use NMR to determine that the CFTR N terminus also binds to several other immunoglobulin-like repeats from filamin A in vitro. Our structural data explain why the cystic fibrosis-causing S13F mutation disrupts CFTR-filamin interaction. We show that FlnA-Ig repeats transfected into cultured Calu-3 cells disrupt CFTR-filamin interaction and reduce surface levels of CFTR. Our findings suggest that filamin A stabilizes surface CFTR by anchoring it to the actin cytoskeleton through interactions with multiple filamin Ig repeats. Such an interaction mode may allow filamins to cluster multiple CFTR molecules and to promote colocalization of CFTR and other filamin-binding proteins in the apical plasma membrane of epithelial cells.},

A. 113, 2839 (2016)] is a method for constructing the reaction coordinate (RC) in molecular systems, especially when they are plagued with hard to sample rare events, given a larger dictionary of order parameters or basis functions and limited static and dynamic information about the system. In its original formulation, SGOOP is designed to construct a 1-dimensional RC. Here we extend its scope by introducing a simple but powerful extension based on the notion of conditional probability factorization where known features are effectively washed out to learn additional and possibly hidden features of the energy landscape. We show how SGOOP can be used to proceed in a sequential and bottom-up manner to (i) systematically probe the need for extending the dimensionality of the RC and (ii) if such a need is identified, learn additional coordinates of the RC in a computationally efficient manner. We formulate the method and demonstrate its utility through three illustrative examples, including the challenging and important problem of calculating the kinetics of benzene unbinding from the protein T4L99A lysozyme, where we obtain excellent agreement in terms of dissociation pathway and kinetics with other sampling methods and experiments. In this last case, starting from a larger dictionary of 11 order parameters that are generic for ligand unbinding processes, we demonstrate how to automatically learn a 2-dimensional RC, which we then use in the infrequent metadynamics protocol to obtain 16 independent unbinding trajectories. We believe our method will be a big step in increasing the utility of SGOOP in performing intuition-free sampling of complex systems. Finally, we believe that the utility of our protocol is amplified by its applicability to not just SGOOP but also other generic methods for constructing the RC.}

Recently, we investigated the combined effect of genistein and curcumin on G551D-CFTR, which exhibits gating defects without abnormalities in protein synthesis or trafficking using the patch-clamp technique. We found that genistein and curcumin showed additive effects on their potentiation of G551D-CFTR in high concentration range and also, more importantly, showed a significant synergistic effect in their minimum concentration ranges. These results are consistent with the idea that multiple mechanisms are involved in the action of these CFTR potentiators.

Yet, obtaining reliable binding mode predictions in peptide-protein docking remains a great challenge for most computational docking programs. The main goal of this study was to assess the performance of the small molecule docking program rDock in comparison to other widely used small molecule docking programs, using 100 peptide-protein systems with peptides ranging from 2 to 12 residues. As we used two large independent benchmark sets previously published for other small-molecule docking programs (AutoDockVina benchmark and LEADSPEP), the performance of rDock could directly be compared to the performances of AutoDockVina, Surflex, GOLD, and Glide, as well as to the peptide docking protocol PIPER-FlexPepDock and the webserver HPepDock. Our benchmark reveals that rDock can dock the 100 peptides with an overall backbone RMSD below 2.5 \AA{} in 58.5\% of the cases (76\% for the 47 systems of the AutoDockVina benchmark set and 43\% for the 53 systems of the LEADSPEP benchmark set). More specifically, rDock docks up to 11-residue peptides with a backbone RMSD below 2.5 \AA{} in 60.75\% of the cases. rDock displays higher accuracy than most available small molecule docking programs for 6\textendash 10-residue peptides and can sometimes perform similarly to the peptide docking tool, especially at a high level of exhaustiveness (100 or 150 runs). Its performance, as is the case for many other unguided small molecule docking tools, is compromised when the peptides adopt secondary structures upon binding. However, our analyses suggest that rDock could be used for predicting how medium-sized biologically relevant peptides bind to their respective protein targets when the latter bind in an extended mode.},

The MD simulations reveal very close agreement between the monolayer and bilayer systems in terms of the fluorophore's orientation and lipid chain order, suggesting that monolayer experiments can be used to approximate bilayer systems. The simulations capture the trend of reduced tilt angle of the fluorophore with increasing surface pressure, as seen in the experimental results, and provide detailed insights into fluorophore location and orientation, not obtainable in the experiments. The simulations also reveal that the enthalpic contribution is dominant at 40 mN/m, resulting in smaller tilt angles of the fluorophore, and the entropy contribution is dominant at lower pressures, resulting in larger tilt angles.},

  abstract = {In CFTR, the chloride ion channel mutated in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients, pore opening is coupled to ATP-binding-induced dimerization of two cytosolic nucleotide binding domains (NBDs) and closure to dimer disruption following ATP hydrolysis. CFTR opening rate, unusually slow because of its high-energy transition state, is further slowed by CF mutation {$\Delta$}F508. Here, we exploit equilibrium gating of hydrolysis-deficient CFTR mutant D1370N and apply rate-equilibrium free-energy relationship analysis to estimate relative timing of opening movements in distinct protein regions. We find clear directionality of motion along the longitudinal protein axis and identify an opening transition-state structure with the NBD dimer formed but the pore still closed. Thus, strain at the NBD/pore-domain interface, the {$\Delta$}F508 mutation locus, underlies the energetic barrier for opening. Our findings suggest a therapeutic opportunity to stabilize this transition-state structure pharmacologically in {$\Delta$}F508-CFTR to correct its opening defect, an essential step toward restoring CFTR function.},

  abstract = {Post-translational covalent modification by ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like proteins (UBLs) is a major eukaryotic mechanism for regulating protein function. In general, each UBL has its own E1 that serves as the entry point for a cascade. The E1 first binds the UBL and catalyzes adenylation of the UBL's C-terminus, prior to promoting UBL transfer to a downstream E2. Ubiquitin's Arg 72, which corresponds to Ala72 in the UBL NEDD8, is a key E1 selectivity determinant: swapping ubiquitin and NEDD8 residue 72 identity was shown previously to swap their E1 specificity. Correspondingly, Arg190 in the UBA3 subunit of NEDD8's heterodimeric E1 (the APPBP1-UBA3 complex), which corresponds to a Gln in ubiquitin's E1 UBA1, is a key UBL selectivity determinant. Here, we dissect this specificity with biochemical and X-ray crystallographic analysis of APPBP1-UBA3-NEDD8 complexes in which NEDD8's residue 72 and UBA3's residue 190 are substituted with different combinations of Ala, Arg, or Gln. APPBP1-UBA3's preference for NEDD8's Ala72 appears to be indirect, due to proper positioning of UBA3's Arg190. By contrast, our data are consistent with direct positive interactions between ubiquitin's Arg72 and an E1's Gln. However, APPBP1-UBA3's failure to interact with a UBL having Arg72 is not due to a lack of this favorable interaction, but rather arises from UBA3's Arg 190 acting as a negative gate. Thus, parallel residues from different UBL pathways can utilize distinct mechanisms to dictate interaction selectivity, and specificity can be amplified by barriers that prevent binding to components of different conjugation cascades. \textcopyright{} 2008 American Chemical Society.}

  abstract = {Molecular-docking programs coupled with suitable scoring functions are now established and very useful tools enabling computational chemists to rapidly screen large chemical databases and thereby to identify promising candidate compounds for further experimental processing. In a broader scenario, predicting binding affinity is one of the most critical and challenging components of computer-aided structure-based drug design. The development of a molecular docking scoring function which in principle could combine both features, namely ranking putative poses and predicting complex affinity, would be of paramount importance. Here, we systematically investigated the performance of the MM-PBSA approach, using two different Poisson-Boltzmann solvers (APBS and DelPhi), in the currently rising field of protein-peptide interactions (PPIs), identifying the correct binding conformations of 19 different protein-peptide complexes and predicting their binding free energies. First, we scored the decoy structures from HADDOCK calculation via the MM-PBSA approach in order to assess the capability of retrieving near-native poses in the best-scoring clusters and of evaluating the corresponding free energies of binding. MM-PBSA behaves well in finding the poses corresponding to the lowest binding free energy, however the built-in HADDOCK score shows a better performance. In order to improve the MM-PBSA-based scoring function, we dampened the MM-PBSA solvation and coulombic terms by 0.2, as proposed in the HADDOCK score and LIE approaches. The new dampened MM-PBSA (dMM-PBSA) outperforms the original MM-PBSA and ranks the decoys structures as the HADDOCK score does. Second, we found a good correlation between the dMM-PBSA and HADDOCK scores for the near-native clusters of each system and the experimental binding energies, respectively. Therefore, we propose a new scoring function, dMM-PBSA, to be used together with the built-in HADDOCK score in the context of protein-peptide docking simulations.},

A recently introduced method of metadynamics allows exploration of the free energy surface of a molecular system by means of coarse-grained dynamics with flooding of free energy minima. This free energy surface is defined as a function of a set of collective variables (e.g., interatomic distances, angles, torsions, and others). In this study, essential coordinates determined by essential dynamics (principle component analysis) were used as collective variables in metadynamics. First, dynamics of the model system (explicitly solvated alanine dipeptide, Ace-Ala-Nme) was simulated by a classical molecular dynamics simulation. The trajectory (1 ns) was then analyzed by essential dynamics to obtain essential coordinates. The free energy surface as a function of the first and second essential coordinates was then explored by metadynamics. The resulting free energy surface is in agreement with other studies of this system. We propose that a combination of these two methods (metadynamics and essential dynamics) has great potential in studies of conformational changes in peptides and proteins. \textcopyright{} 2007 American Chemical Society.}

The so-called surface charges contributed by these residues can play important roles in attracting oppositely charged ions from the bulk solution on one side of the membrane, increasing effective local counterion concentration and favoring rapid ion movement through the channel. Here we use site-directed mutagenesis to identify arginine residues contributing important surface charges in the intracellular mouth of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) Cl- channel pore. While wild-type CFTR was associated with a linear current-voltage relationship with symmetrical solutions, strong outward rectification was observed after mutagenesis of two arginine residues (R303 and R352) located near the intracellular ends of the fifth and sixth transmembrane regions. Current rectification was dependent on the charge present at these positions, consistent with an electrostatic effect. Furthermore, mutagenesis-induced rectification was more pronounced at lower Cl- concentrations, suggesting that these mutants had a reduced ability to concentrate Cl- ions near the inner pore mouth. R303 and R352 mutants exhibited reduced single channel conductance, especially at negative membrane potentials, that was dependent on the charge of the amino acid residue present at these positions. However, the very low conductance of both R303E and R352E-CFTR could be greatly increased by elevating intracellular Cl- concentration. Modification of an introduced cysteine residue at position 303 by charged methanethiosulfonate reagents reproduced charge-dependent effects on current rectification. Mutagenesis of arginine residues in the second and tenth transmembrane regions also altered channel permeation properties, however these effects were not consistent with changes in channel surface charges. These results suggest that positively charged arginine residues act to concentrate Cl- ions at the inner mouth of the CFTR pore, and that this contributes to maximization of the rate of Cl- ion permeation through the pore. \textcopyright{} The Rockefeller University Press.},

Recent findings CFBD continues to increase as the life expectancy of individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF) increases. According to clinical guidelines, individuals with CF should be initially screened at the age of 18 years via dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA), if not done so previously. The underlying pathogenesis of CFBD appears to be multifactorial, but increasing data imply a direct impact by the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). CFTR deficiency and/or dysfunction impair osteoblast activity and differentiation, and indirectly promotes osteoclast formation. Unfortunately, once diagnosed with CFBD, few CF-tested medical therapies exist. Summary CFBD is an increasingly recognized complication that has a significant impact on the overall health of the individual. Recommendations to identify CF patients who are at risk for fracture using DXA have been established. Therapeutic agents directly studied in CF patients are limited to bisphosphonates, although other potential treatment agents exist. Finally, an improved understanding of the pathologic mechanisms will aid in the study and development of therapies.},

Because of this, providing an accurate prognosis has been a longtime quest. Areas covered: Reviewed are the benefits and shortcomings of testing for the major modulators of the severity of disease, like fetal hemoglobin and {$\alpha$} thalassemia, along with studies that have attempted to link genetic variation with sub-phenotypes of disease in a predictive fashion. Induced pluripotent stem cells driven to differentiate into erythroid precursor cells provide another area for potential patient-specific drug testing. Expert opinion: Fetal hemoglobin is the strongest modulator of sickle cell anemia but simply measuring its blood levels is an insufficient means of forecasting an individual's prognosis. A more precise method would be to know the distribution of fetal hemoglobin levels across the population of red cells, an assay not yet available. Prognostic measures have been developed using genetic and other signatures, but their predictive value is suboptimal. Widely applicable assays must be developed to allow a tailored approach to using the several new treatments that are likely to be available in the near future.},

The two NBDs of CFTR have been modelled as a heterodimer, stabilized by ATP binding at two sites in the NBD interface. It has been suggested that ATP hydrolysis occurs at only one of these sites as the putative catalytic base is only conserved in NBD2 of CFTR (Glu 1371), but not in NBD1 where the corresponding residue is a serine, Ser573. Previously, we showed that fragments of CFTR corresponding to NBD1 and NBD2 can be purified and co-reconstituted to form a heterodimer capable of ATPase activity. In the present study, we show that the two NBD fragments form a complex in vivo, supporting the utility of this model system to evaluate the role of Glu1371 in ATP binding and hydrolysis. The present studies revealed that a mutant NBD2 (E1371Q) retains wild-type nucleotide binding affinity of NBD2. On the other hand, this substitution abolished the ATPase activity formed by the co-purified complex. Interestingly, introduction of a glutamate residue in place of the non-conserved Ser 573 in NBD1 did not confer additional ATPase activity by the heterodimer, implicating a vital role for multiple residues in formation of the catalytic site. These findings provide the first biochemical evidence suggesting that the Walker B residue: Glu1371, plays a primary role in the ATPase activity conferred by the NBD1-NBD2 heterodimer. \textcopyright{} 2007 Biochemical Society.},

Here, we delineate global changes in adipocyte signalling networks following acute oxidative stress and reveal considerable crosstalk between cysteine oxidation and phosphorylation-based signalling. Oxidation of key regulatory kinases, including Akt, mTOR and AMPK influences the fidelity rather than their absolute activation state, highlighting an unappreciated interplay between these modifications. Mechanistic analysis of the redox regulation of Akt identified two cysteine residues in the pleckstrin homology domain (C60 and C77) to be reversibly oxidized. Oxidation at these sites affected Akt recruitment to the plasma membrane by stabilizing the PIP3 binding pocket. Our data provide insights into the interplay between oxidative stress-derived redox signalling and protein phosphorylation networks and serve as a resource for understanding the contribution of cellular oxidation to a range of diseases.},

Pharmacological studies have identified both competitive and noncompetitive P-gp substrates, but neither the precise location of the substrate binding sites, nor the basis of competitive and noncompetitive interactions has been fully characterized. Here, potential of mean force (PMF) calculations are used to identify the transport-competent minimum free energy binding locations of five compounds, Hoechst 33342, Rhodamine 123, paclitaxel, tariquidar, and verapamil to P-gp. Unrestrained molecular dynamics simulations were also performed to confirm the substrates were stable in the energy wells determined using the PMF calculations. All compounds had energy minima within the P-gp transmembrane (TM) pore. For Hoechst 33342 and Rhodamine 123, a second minimum outside the TM pore was also identified. Based on this and previous studies of nicardipine and morphine [ Subramanian et al. J. Chem. Inf. Model. 2015, 55, 1202 ], a general scheme that accounts for the observed noncompetitive and competitive substrate interactions with P-gp is proposed.},

The insertion of urea molecules was found to change the density distribution of cations and anions around the given cations significantly, disrupting the long-range ordered structure of choline chloride. Moreover, with increasing urea concentration, the hydrogen bond interactions between choline cations and Cl- anions decreased, while those among urea molecules obviously increased. From the hydrogen bond lifetimes, it was found that a ratio of 1:2 between choline chloride and urea is necessary for a reasonable strength of hydrogen bond interaction to maintain the low melting point of the mixture of choline chloride with urea. In addition, it was also deduced from the interaction energies that a urea content of 67.7 \% may make the interactions of cation-anion, cation-urea and anion-urea modest, and thus results in the lower melting point of the eutectic mixture of choline chloride and urea. The present results may offer assistance to some extent for understanding the physicochemical properties of the eutectic mixture of choline chloride and urea, and give valuable information for the further development and application of deep eutectic solvents. \textcopyright{} 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

The recently developed transition-tempered metadynamics (TTMetaD) has been proven to converge asymptotically without sacrificing exploration of the collective variable space in the early stages of simulations, unlike other convergent metadynamics (MetaD) methods. We have applied TTMetaD to study the permeation of drug-like molecules through a lipid bilayer to further investigate the usefulness of this method as applied to problems of relevance to medicinal chemistry. First, ethanol permeation through a lipid bilayer was studied to compare TTMetaD with nontempered metadynamics and well-tempered metadynamics. The bias energies computed from various metadynamics simulations were compared to the potential of mean force calculated from umbrella sampling. Though all of the MetaD simulations agree with one another asymptotically, TTMetaD is able to predict the most accurate and reliable estimate of the potential of mean force for permeation in the early stages of the simulations and is robust to the choice of required additional parameters. We also show that using multiple randomly initialized replicas allows convergence analysis and also provides an efficient means to converge the simulations in shorter wall times and, more unexpectedly, in shorter CPU times; splitting the CPU time between multiple replicas appears to lead to less overall error. After validating the method, we studied the permeation of a more complicated drug-like molecule, trimethoprim. Three sets of TTMetaD simulations with different choices of collective variables were carried out, and all converged within feasible simulation time. The minimum free energy paths showed that TTMetaD was able to predict almost identical permeation mechanisms in each case despite significantly different definitions of collective variables.},

Of particular interest to current regenerative medicine efforts, we review several examples that support the functional role of transmembrane potential (Vmem) in the regulation of proliferation and differentiation. Interestingly, distinct Vmem controls are found in many cancer cell and precursor cell systems, which are known for their proliferative and differentiation capacities, respectively. Collectively, the data demonstrate that bioelectric properties can serve as markers for cell characterization and can control cell mitotic activity, cell cycle progression, and differentiation. The ability to control cell functions by modulating bioelectric properties such as Vmem would be an invaluable tool for directing stem cell behavior toward therapeutic goals. Biophysical properties of stem cells have only recently begun to be studied and are thus in need of further characterization. Understanding the molecular and mechanistic basis of biophysical regulation will point the way toward novel ways to rationally direct cell functions, allowing us to capitalize upon the potential of biophysical signaling for regenerative medicine and tissue engineering.},

These conditionally reprogrammed cells (CRCs) are karyotype-stable and nontumorigenic. Because self-renewal is a recognized property of stem cells, we investigated whether Y-27632 and feeder cells induced a stem-like phenotype. We found that CRCs share characteristics of adult stem cells and exhibit up-regulated expression of {$\alpha$}6 and {$\beta$}1 integrins, {$\Delta$}Np63{$\alpha$}, CD44, and telomerase reverse transcriptase, as well as decreased Notch signaling and an increased level of nuclear {$\beta$}-catenin. The induction of CRCs is rapid (occurs within 2 d) and results from reprogramming of the entire cell population rather than the selection of a minor subpopulation. CRCs do not overexpress the transcription factor sets characteristic of embryonic or induced pluripotent stem cells (e.g., Sox2, Oct4, Nanog, or Klf4). The induction of CRCs is also reversible, and removal of Y-27632 and feeders allows the cells to differentiate normally. Thus, when CRCs from ectocervical epithelium or tracheal epithelium are placed in an air-liquid interface culture system, the cervical cells form a well differentiated stratified squamous epithelium, whereas the tracheal cells form a ciliated airway epithelium. We discuss the diagnostic and therapeutic opportunities afforded by a method that can generate adult stem-like cells in vitro without genetic manipulation.},

Analysis of these transition functions for signatures of Markovian behavior is described. The method has been applied to an example problem that is based on an underlying Markov process. The example problem shows that when an instance of the process is analyzed under the assumption that the underlying states have been aggregated into macrostates, a procedure known as lumping, the resulting chain appears to have been produced by a non-Markovian process when viewed at high temporal resolution. However, when viewed on longer time scales, and for appropriately lumped macrostates, Markovian behavior can be recovered. The potential for extracting the long time scale behavior of the folding process from a large number of short, independent molecular dynamics simulations is also explored.}

The research community has established FEV1 surveillance data through a variety of observational data sources such as patient registries, and there is a growing pipeline of new CF therapies demonstrated to be efficacious in clinical trials by establishing improvements in FEV1. Results In this review, we summarize from a statistical perspective the clinical relevance of FEV1 based on its association with morbidity and mortality in CF, its role in epidemiologic studies of disease progression and comparative effectiveness, and its utility in clinical trials. In addition, we identify opportunities to advance epidemiologic research and the clinical development pipeline through further statistical considerations. Conclusions Our understanding of CF disease course, therapeutics, and clinical care has evolved immensely in the past decades, in large part due to the thoughtful application of rigorous research methods and meaningful clinical endpoints such as FEV1. A continued commitment to conduct research that minimizes the potential for bias, maximizes the limited patient population, and harmonizes approaches to FEV1 analysis while maintaining clinical relevance, will facilitate further opportunities to advance CF care.},

Mutations at Lys 335 and Arg 347 in the sixth predicted transmembrane helix of CFTR alter its halide selectivity in whole-cell studies9 and its single channel conductance10, but the physical basis of these alterations is unknown and permeation in CFTR is poorly understood. Here we present evidence that wild-type CFTR can contain more than one anion simultaneously. The conductance of CFTR passes through a minimum when channels are bathed in mixtures of two permeant anions. This anomalous mole fraction effect can be abolished by replacing Arg 347 with an aspartate and can be toggled on or off by varying the pH after the same residue is replaced with a histidine. Thus the CFTR channel should provide a convenient model in which to study multi-ion pore behaviour and conduction. The loss of multiple occupancy may explain how naturally occurring CF mutations at this site cause disease. \textcopyright{} 1993 Nature Publishing Group.},

In cell-attached patches with a high Cl- pipette solution, the CFTR channel displayed outwardly rectifying currents and had a conductance near the membrane potential of 6.0 pS at 22\textdegree C or 8.7 pS at 37\textdegree C. The current\textendash voltage relationship became linear when patches were excised into symmetrical, N-tris(hydroxymethyl)methyl-2-aminomethane sulfonate (TES)-buffered solutions. Under these conditions, conductance increased from 7.0 pS at 22\textdegree C to 10.9 pS at 37\textdegree C. The conductance at 22\textdegree C was {$\sim$}1.0 pS higher when TES and HEPES were omitted from the solution, suggesting weak, voltage-independent block by pH buffers. The relationship between conductance and Cl- activity was hyperbolic and well fitted by a Michaelis-Menten\textendash type function having a K m of {$\sim$}38 mM and maximum conductance of 10 pS at 22\textdegree C. Dilution potentials measured with NaCl gradients indicated high anion selectivity (PNa/PCl = 0.003\textendash 0.028). Biionic reversal potentials measured immediately after exposure of the cytoplasmic side to various test anions indicated PI (1.8) {$>$} PBr (1.3) {$>$} PCl (1.0) {$>$} PF (0.17), consistent with a ``weak field strength'' selectivity site. The same sequence was obtained for external halides, although inward F- flow was not observed. Iodide currents were protocol dependent and became blocked after 1\textendash 2 min. This coincided with a large shift in the (extrapolated) reversal potential to values indicating a greatly reduced I-/Cl- permeability ratio (PI/PCl {$<$} 0.4). The switch to low I- permeability was enhanced at potentials that favored Cl- entry into the pore and was not observed in the R347D mutant, which is thought to lack an anion binding site involved in multi-ion pore behavior. Interactions between Cl- and I- ions may influence I- permeation and be responsible for the wide range of PI/PCl ratios that have been reported for the CFTR channel. The low PI/PCl ratio usually reported for CFTR only occurred after entry into an altered permeability state and thus may not be comparable with permeability ratios for other anions, which are obtained in the absence of iodide. We propose that CFTR displays a ``weak field strength'' anion selectivity sequence.},

These methods have been implemented in the CG biomolecular simulator, CafeMol.Our CG model has resolution such that {$\sim$}10 non-hydrogen atoms are grouped into one CG particle on average. For proteins, each amino acid is represented by one CG particle. For DNA, one nucleotide is simplified by three CG particles, representing sugar, phosphate, and base. The protein modeling is based on the idea that proteins have a globally funnel-like energy landscape, which is encoded in the structure-based potential energy function. We first describe two representative minimal models of proteins, called the elastic network model and the classic G{$\overline o$} model. We then present a more elaborate protein model, which extends the minimal model to incorporate sequence and context dependent local flexibility and nonlocal contacts. For DNA, we describe a model developed by de Pablo's group that was tuned to well reproduce sequence-dependent structural and thermodynamic experimental data for single- and double-stranded DNAs. Protein\textendash DNA interactions are modeled either by the structure-based term for specific cases or by electrostatic and excluded volume terms for nonspecific cases.We also discuss the time scale mapping in CG molecular dynamics simulations. While the apparent single time step of our CGMD is about 10 times larger than that in the fully atomistic molecular dynamics for small-scale dynamics, large-scale motions can be further accelerated by two-orders of magnitude with the use of CG model and a low friction constant in Langevin dynamics.Next, we present four examples of applications. First, the classic G{$\overline o$} model was used to emulate one ATP cycle of a molecular motor, kinesin. Second, nonspecific protein\textendash DNA binding was studied by a combination of elaborate protein and DNA models. Third, a transcription factor, p53, that contains highly fluctuating regions was simulated on two perpendicularly arranged DNA segments, addressing intersegmental transfer of p53. Fourth, we simulated structural dynamics of dinucleosomes connected by a linker DNA finding distinct types of internucleosome docking and salt-concentration-dependent compaction.Finally, we discuss many of limitations in the current approaches and future directions. Especially, more accurate electrostatic treatment and a phospholipid model that matches our CG resolutions are of immediate importance.},

Development of pharmaceuticals to treat these diseases and the design of recovery agents for amyloid-type inclusion bodies require the successful suppression and dissolution of such aggregates. Since ionic liquids (ILs) are composed of both a cation and anion and are known to suppress protein aggregation and to dissolve water-insoluble compounds such as cellulose; they may also have potential use as suppression/dissolution agents for amyloid aggregates. In the following review, we present the suppression and dissolution effects of ILs on amyloid aggregates so far reported. The protein\textendash IL affinity (the ability of ILs to interact with amyloid proteins) was found to be the biochemical basis for ILs' suppression of amyloid formation, and the hydrogen-bonding basicity of ILs might be the basis for their ability to dissolve amyloid aggregates. These findings present the potential of ILs to serve as novel pharmaceuticals to treat neurodegenerative diseases and as recovery agents for various amyloid aggregates.},

Analysis of the existing undergraduate and graduate programs, in both Europe and the United States, reveals the minimal attention given to ethics within bioinformatics education. Given that bioinformaticians speedily and effectively shape the biomedical sciences and hence their implications for society, here redesigning of the bioinformatics curricula is suggested in order to integrate the necessary ethics education.

While loss of HCO3- transport is highly relevant to cystic fibrosis, the relative importance of direct and indirect HCO3- transport it is currently unknown. Methods Patch clamp recordings from membrane patches excised from cells heterologously expressing wild type and mutant forms of human CFTR were used to isolate directly CFTR-mediated HCO3- transport and characterize its functional properties. Results The permeability of HCO3- was \textasciitilde 25\% that of Cl- and was invariable under all ionic conditions studied. CFTR-mediated HCO3- currents were inhibited by open channel blockers DNDS, glibenclamide and suramin, and these inhibitions were affected by mutations within the channel pore. Cystic fibrosis mutations previously associated with disrupted cellular HCO3- transport did not affect direct HCO3- permeability. Conclusions Cl- and HCO3- share a common transport pathway in CFTR, and selectivity between Cl- and HCO3- is independent of ionic conditions. The mechanism of transport is therefore effectively identical for both ions. We suggest that mutations in CFTR that cause cystic fibrosis by selectively disrupting HCO3- transport do not impair direct CFTR-mediated HCO3- transport, but may predominantly alter CFTR regulation of other HCO3- transport pathways.},

Advanced analytical techniques currently used for characterization of protein aggregates are prone to a number of limitations and usually require additional manipulations with the sample, such as dilution, separation, labeling, and use of special cuvettes. In the present work, we compared conventional techniques for the analysis of protein aggregates with a novel approach that employs the water proton transverse relaxation rate R2(1H2O). We explored differences in the sensitivity of conventional techniques, size-exclusion chromatography (SEC), microflow imaging (MFI), and dynamic light scattering (DLS), and water NMR (wNMR) toward the presence of monoclonal antibody aggregates generated by different stresses. We demonstrate that wNMR outperformed SEC, DLS, and MFI in that it was most consistently sensitive to increases in both soluble and insoluble aggregates, including subvisible particles. The simplicity of wNMR, its sensitivity, and possibility of noninvasive measurements are unique advantages that would permit its application for more efficient and higher throughput optimization of protein formulations.}

In biological and nanotechnological experiments, methods of extracting and purifying nucleic acids from various types of cells and their storage are critical for obtaining reproducible experimental results. In nanotechnological experiments, methods for regulating the conformational polymorphism of nucleic acids and increasing sequence selectivity for base pairing of nucleic acids are important for developing nucleic acid-based nanomaterials. However, dearth of media that foster favourable behaviour of nucleic acids has been a bottleneck for promoting the biology and nanotechnology using the nucleic acids. Ionic liquids (ILs) are solvents that may be potentially used for controlling the properties of the nucleic acids. Here, we review researches regarding the behaviour of nucleic acids in ILs. The efficiency of extraction and purification of nucleic acids from biological samples is increased by IL addition. Moreover, nucleic acids in ILs show long-term stability, which maintains their structures and enhances nuclease resistance. Nucleic acids in ILs can be used directly in polymerase chain reaction and gene expression analysis with high efficiency. Moreover, the stabilities of the nucleic acids for duplex, triplex, and quadruplex (G-quadruplex and i-motif) structures change drastically with IL cation-nucleic acid interactions. Highly sensitive DNA sensors have been developed based on the unique changes in the stability of nucleic acids in ILs. The behaviours of nucleic acids in ILs detailed here should be useful in the design of nucleic acids to use as biological and nanotechnological tools.},

Truncated fragments of TDP-43 identified from patient tissues contain part of the second RNA recognition motif (RRM2) and the disordered C-terminus, indicating that both domains can be involved in aggregation and toxicity. Here, we focus on RRM2. Using all-atom replica-averaged metadynamics simulations with NMR chemical shift restraints, we characterized the atomic structure of non-native states of RRM2, sparsely populated under native conditions. These structures reveal the exposure to the solvent of aggregation-prone peptide regions, normally buried in the native state, supporting a role in aggregation for the partially folded states of RRM2.},

There are 15 members of the syntaxin family in the human genome and 7 syntaxin-like genes in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In conjunction with other SNAREs and with the cytoplasmic NSF and SNAP proteins, syntaxins mediate vesicle fusion in diverse vesicular transport processes along the exocytic and the endocytic pathway.

  abstract = {P-glycoprotein (Pgp) is a biomedically important member of the ABC transporter superfamily that mediates multidrug resistance in various cancer types. Substrate binding and transport in Pgp are modulated by the presence of cholesterol in the membrane. Structural information on cholesterol binding sites and mechanistic details of its redistribution are, however, largely unknown. In this study, a set of 40 independent molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of Pgp embedded in cholesterol-rich lipid bilayers are reported, totaling 8 {$\mu$}s, enabling extensive sampling of cholesterol-protein interactions in Pgp. Clustering analyses of the ensemble of cholesterol molecules ({$\sim$}5740) sampled around Pgp in these simulations reveal specific and asymmetric cholesterol-binding regions formed by the transmembrane (TM) helices TM1\textendash 6 and TM8. Notably, not all the putative cholesterol binding sites identified by MD can be predicted by the primary sequence based cholesterol-recognition amino acid consensus (CRAC) or inverted CRAC (CARC) motifs, an observation that we attribute to inadequacy of these motifs to account for binding sites formed by remote amino acids in the sequence that can still be spatially adjacent to each other. Binding of cholesterol to Pgp occurs more frequently through its rough {$\beta$}-face formed by the two protruding methyl groups, whereas the opposite smooth {$\alpha$}-face prefers packing alongside the membrane lipids. One full and two partial cholesterol flipping events between the two leaflets of the bilayer mediated by the surface of Pgp are also captured in these simulations. All flipping events are observed in a region formed by helices TM1, TM2, and TM11, featuring two full and two partial CRAC/CARC motifs, with Tyr49 and Tyr126 identified as key residues interacting with cholesterol during this event. Our study is the first to report direct observation of unconventional cholesterol translocation on the surface of Pgp, providing a secondary transport model for the known flippase activity of ABC exporters of cholesterol.

However, the processes by which CFTR is regulated on the cell surface are not clear. Here we report the identification of a protein-protein interaction between CFTR and the cytoskeletal filamin proteins. Using proteomic approaches, we identified filamins as proteins that associate with the extreme CFTR N terminus. Furthermore, we identified a disease-causing missense mutation in CFTR, serine 13 to phenylalanine (S13F), which disrupted this interaction. In cells, filamins tethered plasma membrane CFTR to the underlying actin network. This interaction stabilized CFTR at the cell surface and regulated the plasma membrane dynamics and confinement of the channel. In the absence of filamin binding, CFTR was internalized from the cell surface, where it prematurely accumulated in lysosomes and was ultimately degraded. Our data demonstrate what we believe to be a previously unrecognized role for the CFTR N terminus in the regulation of the plasma membrane stability and metabolic stability of CFTR. In addition, we elucidate the molecular defect associated with the S13F mutation.}

  abstract = {Members of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter superfamily translocate a broad spectrum of chemically diverse substrates. While their eponymous ATP-binding cassette in the nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs) is highly conserved, their transmembrane domains (TMDs) forming the translocation pathway exhibit distinct folds and topologies, suggesting that during evolution the ancient motor domains were combined with different transmembrane mechanical systems to orchestrate a variety of cellular processes. In recent years, it has become increasingly evident that the distinct TMD folds are best suited to categorize the multitude of ABC transporters. We therefore propose a new ABC transporter classification that is based on structural homology in the TMDs.},

  abstract = {Based on the crystal structure of the cross-{$\beta$} spine formed by the peptide NNQQNY, we have developed a computational approach for identifying those segments of amyloidogenic proteins that themselves can form amyloid-like fibrils. The approach builds on experiments showing that hexapeptides are sufficient for forming amyloid-like fibrils. Each six-residue peptide of a protein of interest is mapped onto an ensemble of templates, or 3D profile, generated from the crystal structure of the peptide NNQQNY by small displacements of one of the two intermeshed {$\beta$}-sheets relative to the other. The energy of each mapping of a sequence to the profile is evaluated by using ROSETTADESIGN, and the lowest energy match for a given peptide to the template library is taken as the putative prediction. If the energy of the putative prediction is lower than a threshold value, a prediction of fibril formation is made. This method can reach an accuracy of {$\approx$}80\% with a P value of {$\approx$}10 -12 when a conservative energy threshold is used to separate peptides that form fibrils from those that do not. We see enrichment for positive predictions in a set of fibril-forming segments of amyloid proteins, and we illustrate the method with applications to proteins of interest in amyloid research. \textcopyright{} 2006 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.},

The energy economy of each process including active transport of amino acids, nucleosides, and ions is analyzed. WCM reveals how emergent imbalances lead to slowdowns in the rates of transcription and translation.

The ions move quickly, at (nearly) diffusion  limited rates (               ca               . 10               7               ions s               -1               per channel). Ion channels are central to many properties of cell  membranes. Traditionally they have been the concern of neuroscientists, as they control the  electrical properties of the membranes of excitable cells (neurones, muscle; Hille, 1992).  However, it is evident that ion channels are present in many types of cell, not all of which  are electrically excitable, from diverse organisms, including plants, bacteria and viruses  (where they are involved in functions such as cell homeostasis) in addition to animals. Thus  ion channels are of general cell biological importance. They are also of biomedical interest,  as several dizeases (`channelopathies') have been described which are caused by changes in  properties of a specific ion channel (Ashcroft, 2000). Moreover, passive diffusion channels for  substances other than ions are common (porins, aquaporins), as are active membrane  transport processes coupled to ion gradients or ATP hydrolysis. An understanding of ion  channels may also provide a gateway to understanding these processes.},

Though the DFT method yields excellent gas-phase energetics for the reaction, the QM/MM approach is found to yield overestimation of the activation barrier by ca. 12 kcal/mol. The discrepancy is traced to underestimate of the magnitude of the partial charges on the chlorine atoms in the transition structure. When CM1 or CM3 charges based on semiempirical wave functions are used instead, the agreement with experiment is much improved. The findings emphasize the sensitivity of the results of QM/MM calculations to the choice of QM method, the MM force field, and implementation of the QM/MM interface.}

By the introduction of a history dependent bias which depends on a restricted number of collective variables it can explore complex free energy surfaces characterized by several metastable states separated by large free energy barriers. Here we extend its scope by introducing a simple yet powerful method for calculating the rates of transition between different metastable states. The method does not rely on a previous knowledge of the transition states or reaction coordinates, as long as collective variables are known that can distinguish between the various stable minima in free energy space. We demonstrate that our method recovers the correct escape rates out of these stable states and also preserves the correct sequence of state-to-state transitions, with minimal extra computational effort needed over ordinary metadynamics. We apply the formalism to three different problems and in each case find excellent agreement with the results of long unbiased molecular dynamics runs.},

We show an easy way to calculate it, and by explicitly calculating the time dependence of this constant, we are able to derive a time-independent and locally convergent free energy estimator for metadynamics.

However, they are limited in the timescales that can be reached. Thus, over the years, a suite of enhanced-sampling algorithms have been proposed that assist MD to transcend the timescale limitation, with diverse applications across physical and life sciences. A continuing grand challenge in the success of many such sampling methods pertains to a judicious choice of order parameters. In this work, we propose a new method for designing order parameters that minimizes the role played by human intuition and makes the progress significantly more automated than before. We expect this algorithm to be of great use in furthering the success of enhanced sampling.           ,              In modern-day simulations of many-body systems, much of the computational complexity is shifted to the identification of slowly changing molecular order parameters called collective variables (CVs) or reaction coordinates. A vast array of enhanced-sampling methods are based on the identification and biasing of these low-dimensional order parameters, whose fluctuations are important in driving rare events of interest. Here, we describe a new algorithm for finding optimal low-dimensional CVs for use in enhanced-sampling biasing methods like umbrella sampling, metadynamics, and related methods, when limited prior static and dynamic information is known about the system, and a much larger set of candidate CVs is specified. The algorithm involves estimating the best combination of these candidate CVs, as quantified by a maximum path entropy estimate of the spectral gap for dynamics viewed as a function of that CV. The algorithm is called spectral gap optimization of order parameters (SGOOP). Through multiple practical examples, we show how this postprocessing procedure can lead to optimization of CV and several orders of magnitude improvement in the convergence of the free energy calculated through metadynamics, essentially giving the ability to extract useful information even from unsuccessful metadynamics runs.},

  abstract = {Overbinding of ions is a common and well-known problem in classical molecular dynamics simulations. One of its main causes is the absence of electronic polarizability in the force fields. The current approaches for minimizing overbinding typically either retain the original charges and use an ad hoc readjustment of the Lennard-Jones parameters as done in the nonbonded fix (NBFIX) approach or rescale the charges using a theoretical framework. The goal in the latter is to include shielding produced by the missing electronic polarizability as done in the electronic continuum correction (ECC) approach. NBFIX and ECC are the most common corrections, and we compare their performance to the default parameterizations provided by five different commonly used biomolecular force fields, OPLS-AA/L, CHARMM27, CHARMM36m, CHARMM22*, and AMBER99SB-ILDN. As test systems, we use poly-{$\alpha$},l-glutamic and poly-{$\alpha$},l-aspartic amino acid molecules in explicit water together with Na+ and K+ counterions. We demonstrate that the different force fields yield results that are not only quantitatively but also qualitatively different. The resulting structures of the macroions depend strongly on the model for ions. NBFIX corrections alleviate the problem of overbinding, resulting in extended peptides. The ECC corrections depend nontrivially on the original underlying model, and despite being based on a theoretical framework, they cannot always solve the problem.},

  abstract = {Neddylation is a post-translational protein modification associated with cancer development. MLN4924 is a neddylation inhibitor currently under investigation in multiple phase I studies on various malignancies, and its clincal name is Pevonedistat. It has been documented that MLN4924 blocks Cullins neddylation and inactivates CRLs and, in turn, triggers cell-cycle arrest, apoptosis, senescence and autophagy in many cancer cells. In this study, we investigated the anti-tumor effect of MLN4924 in human clear cell renal carcinoma (ccRCC). Levels of both Nedd8 activating enzyme E1 and Nedd8-conjugating enzyme E2 were higher in ccRCC tissues and RCC cancer cells than in normal. Moreover, MLN4924 treatment led to rapid inhibition of Cullin1 neddylation and notably suppressed growth and survival as well as migration in a dose-and time-dependent manner. Mechanistic studies revealed that MLN4924 induced the accumulation of a number of CRL substrates, including p21, p27 and Wee1 to trigger DNA damage and induce growth arrest at the G2/M phase. MLN4924 also induced anti-migration and anti-invasion by activating E-cadherin and repressing Vimentin. Taken together, this study provides the first evidence that neddylation pathway is overactive in ccRCC and that MLN4924 induces dose-dependent anti-proliferation, anti-migration, anti-invasion in ccRCC cells. The study thus indicates that MLN4924 has potential therapeutic value for the clinical treatment of renal cancer.},

Recent advances in single molecule cryo-EM methods enabled structural determination of full-length human and zebrafish CFTR, achieving an important milestone for CF drug development. To relate these structures to the gating cycle, we examined its dynamic features using molecular dynamics simulations. Our results show that the nucleotide binding domains (NBDs) in this bottom-open apo conformation exhibit motions related to dimerization and the bottom-closed apo CFTR model indicates opening of NBDs in contrast to transporters. These observations help in understanding the properties of CFTR chloride channel distinct from transporters and in proper interpretation of available structural information on this ABC protein.},

Recently, we introduced PLUMED, an open-source plug-in that provides some of the most popular molecular dynamics (MD) codes with implementations of a variety of different enhanced sampling algorithms and collective variables (CVs). The rapid changes in this field, in particular new directions in enhanced sampling and dimensionality reduction together with new hardware, require a code that is more flexible and more efficient. We therefore present PLUMED 2 here - a complete rewrite of the code in an object-oriented programming language (C++). This new version introduces greater flexibility and greater modularity, which both extends its core capabilities and makes it far easier to add new methods and CVs. It also has a simpler interface with the MD engines and provides a single software library containing both tools and core facilities. Ultimately, the new code better serves the ever-growing community of users and contributors in coping with the new challenges arising in the field. \textcopyright{} 2013 Elsevier B.V.

These DESs capture CO2via carbamate formation upon reaction between their hydrogen bonding donor units and CO2. Among the members tested herein, a DES made up of monoethanolamine hydrochloride-ethylenediamine exhibits an unprecedentedly high gravimetric uptake of 33.7 wt\% with good initial kinetics (25.2 wt\% uptake within 2.5 min) and recyclability. The given DES also shows sustainable performance in the presence of water, decent tolerance against temperature rise, and a relatively low heat of absorption which is attractive for regeneration. Even with the high gravimetric uptake, the DES has a far more suppressed corrosiveness compared to its pure monoethanolamine and ethylenediamine counterparts due to low oxygen/moisture permeability and the hydrogen bonding network that alleviates the corrosion redox cycle. The observed excellent properties in various key aspects of CO2 capture suggest that DESs are strong candidates to replace the conventional monoethanolamine-based scrubbing technology and are worth further exploration.}

As one of the underlying mechanisms of Cu, Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1) gene mutation-induced ALS, SOD1 mutants (SOD1mut) commonly interact with an endoplasmic reticulum-resident membrane protein Derlin-1, triggering motoneuron death. However, the importance of SOD1-Derlin-1 interaction in in vitro human model and in vivo mouse model remains to be elucidated. Here, we identify small-molecular-weight compounds that inhibit the SOD1-Derlin-1 interaction by screening approximately 160,000 compounds. The inhibitor prevents 122 types of SOD1mut from interacting with Derlin-1, and significantly ameliorates the ALS pathology both in motoneurons derived from patient induced pluripotent stem cells and in model mice. Our data suggest that the SOD1-Derlin-1 interaction contributes to the pathogenesis of ALS and is a promising drug target for ALS treatment.},

A theoretical study using both density functional theory and molecular dynamics approaches is carried out to analyze the properties of this fluid from the nanoscopic viewpoint, and their relationship with the macroscopic behavior of the system and its ability for CO2capturing. The behavior of the liquid-gas interface is also studied and its role on the CO2absorption mechanism is analyzed.

  abstract = {In recent years, the use of machine learning (ML) in computational chemistry has enabled numerous advances previously out of reach due to the computational complexity of traditional electronic-structure methods. One of the most promising applications is the construction of ML-based force fields (FFs), with the aim to narrow the gap between the accuracy of ab initio methods and the efficiency of classical FFs. The key idea is to learn the statistical relation between chemical structure and potential energy without relying on a preconceived notion of fixed chemical bonds or knowledge about the relevant interactions. Such universal ML approximations are in principle only limited by the quality and quantity of the reference data used to train them. This review gives an overview of applications of ML-FFs and the chemical insights that can be obtained from them. The core concepts underlying ML-FFs are described in detail, and a step-by-step guide for constructing and testing them from scratch is given. The text concludes with a discussion of the challenges that remain to be overcome by the next generation of ML-FFs.},

Removal of the charge in E552Q/E1197Q and D558N/D1203N produced proteins with severely impaired biological activity when the proteins were analyzed in yeast cells for cellular resistance to FK506 and restoration of mating in a ste6{$\Delta$} mutant. Mutations at other acidic residues had no apparent effect in the same assays. These four mutants were expressed in Pichia pastoris, purified to homogeneity, and biochemically characterized with respect to ATPase activity. Studies with purified proteins showed that mutants D558N and D1203N retained 14 and 30\% of the drug-stimulated ATPase activity of wild-type (WT) Mdr3, respectively, and vanadate trapping of 8-azido[{$\alpha$}-32P]nucleotide confirmed slower basal and drug-stimulated 8-azido-ATP hydrolysis compared to that for WT Mdr3. The E552Q and E1197Q mutants showed no drug-stimulated ATPase activity. Surprisingly, drugs did stimulate vanadate trapping of 8-azido[{$\alpha$}-32P]nucleotide in E552Q and E1197Q at a level similar to that of WT Mdr3. This suggests that formation of the catalytic transition state can occur in these mutants, and that the bond between the {$\beta$}- and {$\gamma$}-phosphates is hydrolyzed. In addition, photolabeling by 8-azido[{$\alpha$}-32P]nucleotide in the presence or absence of drug was also detected in the absence of vanadate in these mutants. These results suggest that steps after the transition state, possibly involved in release of MgADP, are severely impaired in these mutant enzymes.},

Because of alternating peptide C-O directions, these helices are capable of forming head-to-head hydrogen-bonded dimers with the capacity of functioning as transmembrane channels. The dimers are characterized as to channel length, pore size, and expected ion selectivity. In a test of the proposed head-to-head association for channel formation, the malonyl dimer [N,N'-(dideformyl gramicidin A)-malonamide] was synthesized. The chemical and conformational integrity of the product was verified by nuclear magnetic resonance; in lipid bilayer studies, the dimer was found to be a potent mediator of ion conductance with the predicted concentration dependence.Thus, the results on malonyl gramicidin A prove head-to-head association in formation of the transmembrane channel, and the results are consistent with the specific geometrical configuration involved in head-to-head dimerization of pi((L,D)) helices. At this stage, the action of gramicidin A on membranes with lipid-layer thicknesses of 30 A or less can best be understood in terms of the pi((L,D)) helix with 6.3 residues per turn.},

METHODS: Isogenic cell lines harboring CFTR variants in the native genomic context were created through the development and utilization of a footprint-less, CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing pipeline in 16HBE14o- immortalized bronchial epithelial cells. RESULTS: Isogenic, homozygous cell lines for three CFTR variants (F508del and the two most common CF-causing nonsense variants, G542X and W1282X) were established and characterized. The F508del model recapitulates the known molecular pathology and pharmacology. The two models of nonsense variants (G542X and W1282X) are sensitive to Nonsense Mediated mRNA Decay (NMD) and responsive to reference compounds that inhibit NMD and promote ribosomal readthrough. CONCLUSIONS: We present a versatile, efficient gene editing pipeline that can be used to create CFTR variants in the native genomic context and the utilization of this pipeline to create homozygous cell models for the CF-causing variants F508del, G542X, and W1282X. The resulting cell lines provide a virtually unlimited source of material with specific pathogenic mutations that can be used in a variety of assays, including functional assays.},

In addition to open and closed conformations, ion channels can exist in an inactivated state, which prevents conduction in the presence of a prolonged activating stimulus(2). Human ether-a-go-go related gene (HERG) K+ channels undergo uniquely rapid and voltage dependent inactivation(3-5), which confers upon them a critical role in protecting against cardiac arrhythmias and sudden death(6). Previous structural studies have captured only the open state of the HERG channel(7,8). Here, we have exploited the K+ sensitivity of HERG inactivation to determine structures of both the conductive state and the elusive inactivated state of HERG. We show that hERG inactivation is facilitated by two competing networks of hydrogen bonds behind the selectivity filter that enable rapid and voltage dependent flipping of the valine carbonyls in the centre of the selectivity filter.  Our data also explains how changes in extracellular K+ affects the distribution between conductive and inactivated states(9,10) and thereby explains why hypokalaemia reduces HERG channel activity thereby increasing the risk of cardiac arrhythmias(11).},

  abstract = {Objectives Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an inherited disease that requires more intensive treatments as the disease progresses. Recent medical advancements have improved survival but have also increased costs. Our lack of understanding on the relationship between disease severity and lifetime health care costs is a major impediment to the timely economic assessment of new treatments. Methods Using data from three waves of the Australian Cystic Fibrosis Australia Data Registry, we estimate the annual costs of CF care by age and health state. We define health states on the basis of annual lung-function scores and patient's organ transplant status. We exploit the longitudinal nature of the data to model disease progression, and we use this to estimate lifetime health care costs. Results The mean annual health care cost for treating CF is US \$15,571. Costs for patients with mild, moderate, and severe disease are US \$10,151, US \$25,647, and US \$33,691, respectively. Lifetime health care costs are approximately US \$306,332 (3.5\% discount rate). The majority of costs are accounted for by hospital inpatients (58\%), followed by pharmaceuticals (29\%), medical services (10\%), complications (2\%), and diagnostic tests (1\%). Conclusions Our study is the first of its kind using the Australian Cystic Fibrosis Data Registry, and demonstrates the utility of longitudinal registry data for the purpose of economic analysis. Our results can be used as an input to future economic evaluations by providing analysts with a better understanding of the long-term cost impact when new treatments are developed.},

Most CF mutations either reduce the number of CFTR channels at the cell surface (e.g., synthesis or processing mutations) or impair channel function (e.g., gating or conductance mutations) or both. There are currently no approved therapies that target CFTR. Here we describe the in vitro pharmacology of VX-770, an orally bioavailable CFTR potentiator in clinical development for the treatment of CF. In recombinant cells VX-770 increased CFTR channel open probability (Po) in both the F508del processing mutation and the G551D gating mutation. VX-770 also increased Cl - secretion in cultured human CF bronchial epithelia (HBE) carrying the G551D gating mutation on one allele and the F508del processing mutation on the other allele by {$\approx$}10-fold, to {$\approx$}50\% of that observed in HBE isolated from individuals without CF. Furthermore, VX-770 reduced excessive Na+ and fluid absorption to prevent dehydration of the apical surface and increased cilia beating in these epithelial cultures. These results support the hypothesis that pharmacological agents that restore or increase CFTR function can rescue epithelial cell function in human CF airway.},

Most patients with CF carry the F508del CFTR mutation, which causes defective CFTR protein folding and processing in the endoplasmic reticulum, resulting in minimal amounts of CFTR at the cell surface. One strategy to treat these patients is to correct the processing of F508del-CFTR with small molecules. Here we describe the in vitro pharmacology of VX-809, a CFTR corrector that was advanced into clinical development for the treatment of CF. In cultured human bronchial epithelial cells isolated from patients with CF homozygous for F508del, VX-809 improved F508del-CFTR processing in the endoplasmic reticulum and enhanced chloride secretion to approximately 14\% of non-CF human bronchial epithelial cells (EC(50), 81 {$\pm$} 19 nM), a level associated with mild CF in patients with less disruptive CFTR mutations. F508del-CFTR corrected by VX-809 exhibited biochemical and functional characteristics similar to normal CFTR, including biochemical susceptibility to proteolysis, residence time in the plasma membrane, and single-channel open probability. VX-809 was more efficacious and selective for CFTR than previously reported CFTR correctors. VX-809 represents a class of CFTR corrector that specifically addresses the underlying processing defect in F508del-CFTR.},

The aim of this in vitro study was to evaluate the effect of ivacaftor on mutant CFTR protein forms with defects in protein processing and/or channel function. Methods: The effect of ivacaftor on CFTR function was tested in electrophysiological studies using a panel of Fischer rat thyroid (FRT) cells expressing 54 missense CFTR mutations that cause defects in the amount or function of CFTR at the cell surface. Results: Ivacaftor potentiated multiple mutant CFTR protein forms that produce functional CFTR at the cell surface. These included mutant CFTR forms with mild defects in CFTR processing or mild defects in CFTR channel conductance. Conclusions: These in vitro data indicated that ivacaftor is a broad acting CFTR potentiator and could be used to help stratify patients with CF who have different CFTR genotypes for studies investigating the potential clinical benefit of ivacaftor. \textcopyright{} 2013 European Cystic Fibrosis Society.},

Statistics related to the quality of the parametrization with a focus on experimental validation are presented. Additionally, the parametrization procedure, described fully in the present article in the context of the model systems, pyrrolidine, and 3-phenoxymethylpyrrolidine will allow users to readily extend the force field to chemical groups that are not explicitly covered in the force field as well as add functional groups to and link together molecules already available in the force field.

We here revisited function and folding of some class-IV mutants and discovered that R347P is the only one that leads to major defects in folding. By this criterion and by its functional response to corrector drug VX-809, R347P qualifies also as a class-II mutation. Other class-IV mutants folded like wild-type CFTR and responded similarly to VX-809, demonstrating how function and folding are connected. Studies on both types of defects complement each other in understanding how compounds improve mutant CFTR function.

  abstract = {AutoDock Tools allows the analysis of docking files and is used to represent clustering conformations, yet it analyses only one docking file at a time and the method applied to represent the clustering complicates the visualization of clustering conformations. The creation of a plugin called PyDRA for the molecular visualizer PyMOL resolves that problem and allows to simultaneously process more than one docking file for the two types of file format from AutoDock 4.2 and Vina 1.1 (dlg and pdbqt). Moreover, this plugin facilitates the visualization of conformations through two clustering methods. The first method is a K-RMSD algorithm, which is based on the clustering through RMSD and enables the interactive visualization groups through a treemap. And the other one is based on a hierarchical clustering algorithm, using an algorithm of average distances which generates a dendrogram that offers the possibility to explore sequentially the groups that illustrate best the docking. The results obtained with the visualization methods implemented showed that the treemap, due to the implemented colour bar, facilitates to identify the clusters that have a greater affinity to the protein at a glance, and to determine which of the clusters hold a greater number of elements, on the other hand, the dendrogram shows a detailed analyses of the hierarchical clustering, which also enables the user to distinguish the clustering regardless the size of the window, as well as to differentiate each cluster and conformation in order to gain insight of docking results of Autdock and Vina. The fact that both visualizations are connected to PyMOL increases its ability of discernment.},

We then illustrate a new Second Law of Thermodynamics that describes information processing in active low-dimensional materials, reviewing Maxwell's Demon and a new class of molecular devices that act as information catalysts.

To assess a possible relationship between this phenomenon and both the genotype and the phenotype, we performed Ussing chamber experiments on rectal suction biopsies of 51 CF patients. The CF mutation was identified in 89 out of 102 CF alleles. No apparent chloride secretion was found in 30 CF patients (group I). Low residual chloride secretion was found in 11 CF patients (group II), while a relatively high residual secretion appeared in 10 CF patients (group III). Pancreatic function was preserved more frequently in CF patients displaying residual secretion: 0\% in group I, 27\% in group II, and 60\% in group III (P {$<$} 0.001). The age at diagnosis (mean{$\pm$}SEM) in group III (18.4{$\pm$}6.6) was significantly different from group I (1.2{$\pm$}0.4, P {$<$} 0.01) and group II (3.5{$\pm$}1.4, P = 0.05). Residual chloride secretion was found in some of the 28 dF508 homozygous patients (three in group II, and one in group III), disclosing that other factors than the CF gene defect itself affect the transepithelial chloride transport. The age at diagnosis correlates significantly with the magnitude of the secretory response, even within the dF508 homozygous patients (r = 0.4, P {$<$} 0.05). We conclude that residual chloride secretion in CF is the pathophysiological basis of preserved pancreatic function and delayed presentation of the disease, which is not exclusively determined by the CF genotype.},

  abstract = {More than 2000 mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) have been described that confer a range of molecular cell biological and functional phenotypes. Most of these mutations lead to compromised anion conductance at the apical plasma membrane of secretory epithelia and cause cystic fibrosis (CF) with variable disease severity. Based on the molecular phenotypic complexity of CFTR mutants and their susceptibility to pharmacotherapy, it has been recognized that mutations may impose combinatorial defects in CFTR channel biology. This notion led to the conclusion that the combination of pharmacotherapies addressing single defects (e.g., transcription, translation, folding, and/or gating) may show improved clinical benefit over available low-efficacy monotherapies. Indeed, recent phase 3 clinical trials combining ivacaftor (a gating potentiator) and lumacaftor (a folding corrector) have proven efficacious in CF patients harboring the most common mutation (deletion of residue F508, {$\delta$}F508, or Phe508del). This drug combination was recently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for patients homozygous for {$\delta$}F508. Emerging studies of the structural, cell biological, and functional defects caused by rare mutations provide a new framework that reveals a mixture of deficiencies in different CFTR alleles. Establishment of a set of combinatorial categories of the previously defined basic defects in CF alleles will aid the design of even more efficacious therapeutic interventions for CF patients.},

To overcome the corrector efficacy ceiling, here we show that compounds targeting distinct structural defects of CFTR can synergistically rescue mutants expression and function at the PM.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The potentiator ivacaftor (VX-770) has been approved for therapy of 38 cystic fibrosis (CF) mutations ({$\sim$}10\% of the patient population) associated with a gating defect of the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). Despite the success of VX-770 treatment of patients carrying at least one allele of the most common gating mutation G551D-CFTR, some lung function decline and P. aeruginosa colonization persist. This study aims at identifying potentiator combinations that can considerably enhance the limited channel activity of a panel of CFTR gating mutants over monotherapy. METHODS: The functional response of 13 CFTR mutants to single potentiators or systematic potentiator combinations was determined in the human bronchial epithelial cell line CFBE41o- and a subset of them was confirmed in primary human nasal epithelia (HNE). RESULTS: In six out of thirteen CFTR missense mutants the fractional plasma membrane (PM) activity, a surrogate measure of CFTR channel gating, reached only {$\sim$}10-50\% of WT channel activity upon VX-770 treatment, indicating incomplete gating correction. Combinatorial potentiator profiling and cluster analysis of mutant responses to 24 diverse investigational potentiators identified several compound pairs that improved the gating activity of R352Q-, S549R-, S549N-, G551D-, and G1244E-CFTR to {$\sim$}70-120\% of the WT. Similarly, the potentiator combinations were able to confer WT-like function to G551D-CFTR in patient-derived human nasal epithelia. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that half of CF patients with missense mutations approved for VX-770 administration, could benefit from the development of dual potentiator therapy.},

Neither the mechanism of action of VX-445 nor the susceptibility of rare CF folding mutants to Trikafta are known. Here, we show that, in human bronchial epithelial cells, VX-445 synergistically restores F508del-CFTR processing in combination with type I or II correctors that target the nucleotide binding domain 1 (NBD1) membrane spanning domains (MSDs) interface and NBD2, respectively, consistent with a type III corrector mechanism. This inference was supported by the VX-445 binding to and unfolding suppression of the isolated F508del-NBD1 of CFTR. The VX-661 plus VX-445 treatment restored F508del-CFTR chloride channel function in the presence of VX-770 to approximately 62\% of WT CFTR in homozygous nasal epithelia. Substantial rescue of rare misprocessing mutations (S13F, R31C, G85E, E92K, V520F, M1101K, and N1303K), confined to MSD1, MSD2, NBD1, and NBD2 of CFTR, was also observed in airway epithelia, suggesting an allosteric correction mechanism and the possible application of Trikafta for patients with rare misfolding mutants of CFTR.},

Trikafta indications were recently expanded to additional 177 mutations in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). To minimize life-long pharmacological and financial burden of drug administration, if possi-ble, we determined the necessary and sufficient modulator combination that can achieve maximal benefit in preclinical setting for selected mutants. To this end, the biochemical and functional rescue of single corrector-responsive rare mutants were investigated in a bronchial epithelial cell line and patient-derived human primary nasal epithelia (HNE), respectively. The plasma membrane density of P67L-, L206W-or S549R-CFTR corrected by VX-661 or other type I correctors was moderately increased by VX-445. Short-circuit current measurements of HNE, however, uncovered that correction comparable to Trikafta was achieved for S549R-CFTR by VX-661 + VX-770 and for P67L-and L206W-CFTR by the VX-661 + VX-445 combination. Thus, introduction of a third modulator may not provide additional benefit for patients with a subset of rare CFTR missense mutations. These results also underscore that HNE, as a precision medicine model, enable the optimization of mutation-specific modulator combinations to maximize their efficacy and minimize life-long drug exposure of CF patients.},

The method is demonstrated to be highly accurate for simple bulk fluids, liquid/liquid and liquid/vapor interfaces, and lipid bilayers and monolayers. Values for rC (the cutoff distance for direct evaluation of pairs) and RC (the local region radius) equal to 10 \AA{} and twice the longest edge of the periodic cell, respectively, provide excellent efficiency and accuracy.

  abstract = {ABC (ATP-binding cassette) proteins constitute a large family of membrane proteins that actively transport a broad range of substrates. Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), the protein dysfunctional in cystic fibrosis, is unique among ABC proteins in that its transmembrane domains comprise an ion channel. Opening and closing of the pore have been linked to ATP binding and hydrolysis at CFTR's two nucleotide-binding domains, NBD1 and NBD2 (see, for example, refs 1, 2). Isolated NBDs of prokaryotic ABC proteins dimerize upon binding ATP, and hydrolysis of the ATP causes dimer dissociation3,4,5. Here, using single-channel recording methods on intact CFTR molecules, we directly follow opening and closing of the channel gates, and relate these occurrences to ATP-mediated events in the NBDs. We find that energetic coupling6 between two CFTR residues, expected to lie on opposite sides of its predicted NBD1\textendash NBD2 dimer interface, changes in concert with channel gating status. The two monitored side chains are independent of each other in closed channels but become coupled as the channels open. The results directly link ATP-driven tight dimerization of CFTR's cytoplasmic nucleotide-binding domains to opening of the ion channel in the transmembrane domains. This establishes a molecular mechanism, involving dynamic restructuring of the NBD dimer interface, that is probably common to all members of the ABC protein superfamily.},

  abstract = {Cystic fibrosis (CF) is caused by mutations in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein, an epithelial chloride channel expressed in the airways, pancreas, testis, and other tissues. A central question is how defective CFTR function in CF leads to chronic lung infection and deterioration of lung function. Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain lung disease in CF, including abnormal airway surface liquid (ASL) properties, defective airway submucosal gland function, altered inflammatory response, defective organellar acidification, loss of CFTR regulation of plasma membrane ion transporters, and others. This review focuses on the physiology of the ASL and submucosal glands with regard to their proposed role in CF lung disease. Experimental evidence for defective ASL properties and gland function in CF is reviewed, and deficiencies in understanding ASL/gland physiology are identified as areas for further investigation. New model systems and measurement technologies are being developed to make progress in establishing lung disease mechanisms in CF, which should facilitate mechanism-based design of therapies for CF.},

A single nucleotide transition that changes alanine 171 to threonine (A171T) of the NAE subunit UBA3 reduces the enzymes sensitivity for MLN4924. Our molecular dynamics simulation study revealed that A171T transition brought remarkable conformational changes in enzyme structure (open ATP binding pocket), which reduced the interaction between MLN4924 and ATP binding pocket while wild form completely covered the MLN4924. A total difference of -49.75 kJ/mol was noticed in interaction energy (electrostatic and van der Waals) during simulation between mutant and wild form with MLN4924. Superimposition of final 20 ns mutant structure with reference structure showed significant change in native binding position as compared to wild form.

  abstract = {The majority of cystic fibrosis (CF)-causing mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) lead to the misfolding, mistrafficking, and degradation of the mutant protein. Inhibition of degradation does not effectively increase the amount of trafficking competent CFTR, but typically leads to increased ER retention of misfolded forms. Thus, the initial off pathway steps occur early in the processing of the protein. To identify proteins that interact with these early forms of CFTR, in vitro crosslink experiments identified cotranslational partners of the nascent chain of the severe misfolded mutant, G85E CFTR. The mutant preferentially interacts with a subunit of an N-alpha-acetyltransferase A. Based on recent reports that acetylation of the N-termini of some N-end rule substrates control their ubiquitination and subsequent degradation, a potential role for this modification in regulation of CFTR expression was assessed. Knockdown experiments identified two complexes, which affect G85E CFTR proteins levels, NatA and NatB. Effects of the knockdowns on mRNA levels, translation rates, and degradation rates established that the two complexes regulate G85E CFTR through two separate mechanisms. NatA acts indirectly by regulating transcription levels and NatB acts through a previously identified, but incompletely understood posttranslational mechanism. This regulation did not effect trafficking of G85E CFTR, which remains retained in the ER, nor did it alter the degradation rate of CFTR. A mutation predicted to inhibit N-terminal acetylation of CFTR, Q2P, was without effect, suggesting neither system acts directly on CFTR. These results contradict the prediction that N-terminal acetylation of CFTR determines its fitness as a proteasome substrate, but rather NatB plays a role in the conformational maturation of CFTR in the ER through actions on an unidentified protein.}

  abstract = {Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) describes a physical phenomenon widely applied in biomedical research to estimate separations between biological molecules. Routinely, genetic engineering is used to incorporate spectral variants of the green fluorescent protein (GFPs), into cellular expressed proteins. The transfer efficiency or rate of energy transfer between donor and acceptor FPs is then assayed. As appreciable FRET occurs only when donors and acceptors are in close proximity (1-10nm), the presence of FRET may indicate that the engineered proteins associate as interacting species. For a homogeneous population of FRET pairs the separations between FRET donors and acceptors can be estimated from a measured FRET efficiency if it is assumed that donors and acceptors are randomly oriented and rotate extensively during their excited state (dynamic regime). Unlike typical organic fluorophores, the rotational correlation-times of FPs are typically much longer than their fluorescence lifetime; accordingly FPs are virtually static during their excited state. Thus, estimating separations between FP FRET pairs is problematic. To overcome this obstacle, we present here a simple method for estimating separations between FPs using the experimentally measured average FRET efficiency. This approach assumes that donor and acceptor fluorophores are randomly oriented, but do not rotate during their excited state (static regime). This approach utilizes a Monte-Carlo simulation generated look-up table that allows one to estimate the separation, normalized to the Fo rster distance, from the average FRET efficiency. Assuming a dynamic regime overestimates the separation significantly (by 10\% near 0.5 and 30\% near 0.75 efficiencies) compared to assuming a static regime, which is more appropriate for estimates of separations between FPs.},

This long-term observational safety study evaluated CF disease progression in patients treated with ivacaftor in a real-world setting for up to 5 years. Methods: Data from existing US and UK CF patient registries were used to assess longitudinal patterns in lung function, nutritional status, pulmonary exacerbations and hospitalizations, CF-related diabetes (CFRD), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in ivacaftor-treated vs untreated comparator cohorts matched by age, sex, and disease severity. Results: US analyses included 635 ivacaftor-treated patients and 1874 comparators followed for 5 years from year 1 of market availability (2012\textendash 2016). Evaluation of outcome patterns from pretreatment baseline (2011) through year 5 (2016), showed that relative to comparators, ivacaftor-treated patients had better preserved lung function (mean change in percent predicted FEV1, -0.7 percentage points with ivacaftor vs -8.3 percentage points in comparators) and improved nutritional status (mean body mass index change +2.4 kg/m2 with ivacaftor vs +1.6 kg/m2 in comparators). US patients treated with ivacaftor had significantly lower frequencies of exacerbations and hospitalizations in each of the 5 years of follow-up relative to pretreatment baseline and comparators. Favorable trends in CFRD and P. aeruginosa prevalence were also observed. Findings from the smaller UK registry were directionally similar to and consistent with US findings. Conclusions: This observational study represents the largest longitudinal analysis of patients treated with ivacaftor in a real-world setting. The findings support disease modification by CFTR modulation with ivacaftor.},

  abstract = {Probably the most prominent expectation associated with systems biology is the computational support of personalized medicine and predictive health. At least some of this anticipated support is envisioned in the form of disease simulators that will take hundreds of personalized biomarker data as input and allow the physician to explore and optimize possible treatment regimens on a computer before the best treatment is applied to the actual patient in a custom-tailored manner. The key prerequisites for such simulators are mathematical and computational models that not only manage the input data and implement the general physiological and pathological principles of organ systems but also integrate the myriads of details that affect their functionality to a significant degree. Obviously, the construction of such models is an overwhelming task that suggests the long-tern development of hierarchical or telescopic approaches representing the physiology of organs and their diseases, first coarsely and over time with increased granularity., This article illustrates the rudiments of such a strategy in the context of cystic fibrosis (CF) of the lung. The starting point is a very simplistic, generic model of inflammation, which has been shown to capture the principles of infection, trauma, and sepsis surprisingly well. The adaptation of this model to CF contains as variables healthy and damaged cells, as well as different classes of interacting cytokines and infectious microbes that are affected by mucus formation, which is the hallmark symptom of the disease []. The simple model represents the overall dynamics of the disease progression, including so-called acute pulmonary exacerbations, quite well, but of course does not provide much detail regarding the specific processes underlying the disease. In order to launch the next level of modeling with finer granularity, it is desirable to determine which components of the coarse model contribute most to the disease dynamics. The article introduces for this purpose the concept of module gains or ModGains, which quantify the sensitivity of key disease variables in the higher-level system. In reality, these variables represent complex modules at the next level of granularity, and the computation of ModGains therefore allows an importance ranking of variables that should be replaced with more detailed models. The "hot-swapping" of such detailed modules for former variables is greatly facilitated by the architecture and implementation of the overarching, coarse model structure, which is here formulated with methods of Biochemical Systems Theory (BST).},

The ability of ions to retain their immediate hydration environment, combined with the lack of sensitivity of permeability to ion type or even ion pairs, led us to question the extent to which hydration energetics and electrostatics control membrane ion permeation. Using the arginine analog methyl-guanidinium as a test case, we find that although hydrocarbon electronic polarizability causes dramatic changes in ion solvation free energy, as well as a significant change ({$\sim$}0.4 V) in the membrane dipole potential, little change in membrane permeation energetics occurs. We attribute this to compensation of solvation terms from polar and polarizable nonpolar components within the membrane, and explain why the dipole potential is not fully sensed in terms of the locally deformed bilayer interface. Our descriptions provide a deeper understanding of the translocation process and allow predictions for poly-ions, ion pairs, charged lipids, and lipid flip-flop. We also report simulations of large hydrophobic-ion-like membrane defects and the ionophore valinomycin, which exhibit little membrane deformation, as well as hydrophilic defects and the ion channel gramicidin A, to provide parallels to membranes deformed by unassisted ion permeation. \textcopyright{} 2010 by the Biophysical Society.},

  abstract = {ConspectusDeep eutectic solvents (DESs) represent an alternative class of ionic fluids closely resembling room-temperature ionic liquids (RTILs), although, strictly speaking, they are distinguished by the fact that they also contain an organic molecular component (typically, a hydrogen bond donor like a urea, amide, acid, or polyol), frequently as the predominant constituent. Practically speaking, DESs are attractive alternatives to RTILs, sharing most of their remarkable qualities (e.g., tolerance to humidity, negligible vapor pressure, thermostability, wide electrochemical potential windows, tunability) while overcoming several limitations associated with their RTIL cousins. Particularly, DESs are typically, less expensive, more synthetically accessible (typically, from bulk commodity chemicals using solvent/waste-free processes), nontoxic, and biodegradable.In this Account, we provide an overview of DESs as designer solvents to create well-defined nanomaterials including shape-controlled nanoparticles, electrodeposited films, metal-organic frameworks, colloidal assemblies, hierarchically porous carbons, and DNA/RNA architectures. These breakthroughs illustrate how DESs can fulfill multiple roles in directing chemistry at the nanoscale: acting as supramolecular template, metal/carbon source, sacrificial agent (e.g., ammonia release from urea), and/or redox agent, all in the absence of formal stabilizing ligand (here, solvent and stabilizer are one and the same).The ability to tailor the physicochemical properties of DESs is central to controlling their interfacial behavior. The preorganized "supramolecular" nature of DESs provides a soft template to guide the formation of bimodal porous carbon networks or the evolution of electrodeposits. A number of essential parameters (viscosity, polarity, surface tension, hydrogen bonding), plus coordination with solutes/surfaces, all play significant roles in modulating species reactivity and mass transport properties governing the genesis of nanostructure. Furthermore, DES components may modulate nucleation and growth mechanisms by charge neutralization, modification of reduction potentials (or chemical activities), and passivation of particular crystal faces, dictating growth along preferred crystallographic directions. Broad operational windows for electrochemical reactions coupled with their inherent ionic nature facilitate the electrodeposition of alloys and semiconductors inaccessible to classical means and the use of cosolvents or applied potential control provide under-explored strategies for mediating interfacial interactions leading to control over film characteristics.The biocompatibility of DESs suggests intriguing potential for the construction of biomolecular architectures in these novel media. It has been demonstrated that nucleic acid structures can be manipulated in the ionic, crowded, dehydrating (low water activity) DES environment-including the adoption of duplex helical structures divergent from the canonical B form and parallel G-quadruplex DNA persisting near waters boiling point-challenging the misconception that water is a necessity for maintenance of nucleic acid structure/functionality and suggesting an enticing trajectory toward DNA/RNA-based nanocatalysis within a strictly anhydrous medium.DESs offer tremendous opportunities and open intriguing perspectives for generating sophisticated nanostructures within an anhydrous or low-water medium. We conclude this Account by offering our thoughts on the evolution of the field, pointing to areas of clear and compelling utility which will surely see fruition in the coming years. Finally, we highlight a few hurdles (e.g., need for a universal nomenclature, absence of water-immiscible, oriented-phase, and low-viscosity DESs) which, once navigated, will hasten progress in this area. \textcopyright{} 2014 American Chemical Society.},

However, when the diffusion dynamics are analyzed on the subnanometer length scale, we find that the displacements associated with the localized diffusive motions are actually larger for choline. This counterintuitive diffusive behavior can be understood as follows. The localized diffusive motions confined in the transient cage of neighbor particles, which precede the cage-breaking long-range diffusion jumps, are more spatially constrained for glycerol than for choline because of the stronger hydrogen bonds the former makes with chloride anions. The implications of such differential localized mobility of the constituents should be especially important for applications where deep eutectic solvents are confined on the nanometer length scale and their long-range translational diffusion is strongly inhibited (e.g., within microporous media).},

Computational efforts consistently reveal that the addition of hydrogen bond donors significantly disrupts long-range ordering of the cation\textendash anion arrangement in choline chloride, resulting in significant moderation of the interaction energies between the components of the DES. These studies paint a picture of DES formation being accompanied by hydrogen-bond directed charge transfer processes yielding transient cage-like formation and nanoscale ordering entailing segregation of the ionic and molecular domains. Computational insights further uncover how unique solvation features present within DESs may lead to enhanced biomolecular (e.g., protein, nucleic acid, polysaccharide) stability and/or activity while also offering advantages as environmentally-responsible gas sorbents.},

Phe508del is the most common CFTR mutation. METHODS: We conducted two phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies that were designed to assess the effects of lumacaftor (VX-809), a CFTR corrector, in combination with ivacaftor (VX-770), a CFTR potentiator, in patients 12 years of age or older who had cystic fibrosis and were homozygous for the Phe508del CFTR mutation. In both studies, patients were randomly assigned to receive either lumacaftor (600 mg once daily or 400 mg every 12 hours) in combination with ivacaftor (250 mg every 12 hours) or matched placebo for 24 weeks. The primary end point was the absolute change from baseline in the percentage of predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) at week 24. RESULTS: A total of 1108 patients underwent randomization and received study drug. The mean baseline FEV1 was 61\% of the predicted value. In both studies, there were significant improvements in the primary end point in both lumacaftor-ivacaftor dose groups; the difference between active treatment and placebo with respect to the mean absolute improvement in the percentage of predicted FEV1 ranged from 2.6 to 4.0 percentage points (P{$<$}0.001), which corresponded to a mean relative treatment difference of 4.3 to 6.7\% (P{$<$}0.001). Pooled analyses showed that the rate of pulmonary exacerbations was 30 to 39\% lower in the lumacaftor-ivacaftor groups than in the placebo group; the rate of events leading to hospitalization or the use of intravenous antibiotics was lower in the lumacaftor-ivacaftor groups as well. The incidence of adverse events was generally similar in the lumacaftor-ivacaftor and placebo groups. The rate of discontinuation due to an adverse event was 4.2\% among patients who received lumacaftor-ivacaftor versus 1.6\% among those who received placebo. CONCLUSIONS: These data show that lumacaftor in combination with ivacaftor provided a benefit for patients with cystic fibrosis homozygous for the Phe508del CFTR mutation.

  abstract = {Gramicidin is a polypeptide antibiotic which forms dimeric channels specific for the transport of monovalent cations across membranes. It adopts several different conformations, most notably double helical (pore) and helical dimer (channels) forms, which have very different structural and functional characteristics. This review focuses on recent high resolution structure determinations of both the pore and channel forms of the molecule by X-ray crystallographic and/or NMR spectroscopic techniques. It discusses the structural consequences of binding ions and the location of ion binding sites and how the structures are related to the conductance properties of the molecule. This relatively simple molecule is probably the best characterized ion channel (both structurally and functionally) and has, to date, been the principal proving-ground for many of our ideas about the molecular nature of ion conduction in membranes.},

This study examined whether that efficacy can be translated into effectiveness in routine clinical practice. METHOD: Seventy-eight adult women with bulimic disorders (bulimia nervosa and atypical bulimia nervosa) undertook individual CBT, with few exclusion criteria and a treatment protocol based on evidence-based approaches, utilizing individualized formulations. Patients completed measures of eating behaviors, eating attitudes, and depression pre- and post-treatment. Eight patients dropped out. The mean number of sessions attended was 19.2. RESULTS: No pretreatment features predicted drop-out. Treatment outcome was similar whether using treatment completer or intent to treat analyses. Approximately 50\% of patients were in remission by the end of treatment. There were significant improvements in mood, eating attitudes, and eating behaviors. Reductions in bingeing and vomiting were comparable to efficacy trials. DISCUSSION: The improvements in this "real-world" trial of CBT for adults with bulimic disorders mirrored those from large, funded research trials, though the conclusions that can be reached are inevitably limited by the nature of the trial (e.g., lack of control group and therapy validation).},

  abstract = {Multiple transmembrane (TM) segments line the pore of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator Cl- channel; however, the relative alignment of these TMs and their relative movements during channel gating are unknown. To gain three-dimensional structural information on the outer pore, we have used patch clamp recording to study the proximity of pairs of cysteine side chains introduced into TMs 6 and 11, using both disulfide cross-linking and Cd2+ coordination. Following channel activation, disulfide bonds could apparently be formed between three cysteine pairs (of 15 studied): R334C/T1122C, R334C/G1127C, and T338C/S1118C. To examine the state dependence of cross-linking, we combined these cysteine mutations with a nucleotide-binding domain mutation (E1371Q) that stabilizes the channel open state. Investigation of the effects of the E1371Q mutation on disulfide bond formation and Cd2+ coordination suggests that although R334C/T1122C and T338C/S1118C are closer together in the channel open state, R334C/G1127C are close together and can form disulfide bonds only when the channel is closed. These results provide important new information on the three-dimensional structure of the outer mouth of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator channel pore: TMs 6 and 11 are close enough together to form disulfide bonds in both open and closed channels. Moreover, the altered relative locations of residues in open and in closed channels that we infer allow us to propose that channel opening and closing may be associated with a relative translational movement of TMs 6 and 11, with TM6 moving ``down'' (toward the cytoplasm) during channel opening.},

  abstract = {The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) chloride channel is activated by ATP binding-induced dimerization of nucleotide-binding domains, the interaction between the phosphorylated regulatory (R) domain and the curcumin-sensitive interface between intracellular loop (ICL) 1 and ICL4, and the resultant inward-to-`outward' reorientation of transmembrane domains. Although transmembrane helices (TM) 2 and TM11 link the ICL1\textendash ICL4 interface with the interface between extracellular loop (ECL) 1 and ECL6, it is unknown whether both interfaces are gating-coupled during the reorientation. Herein, R334C and T1122C mutations were used to engineer two Zn2+ bridges near and at the ECL1\textendash ECL6 interface, respectively, and the gating effects of a Zn2+ disturbance at the ECL1\textendash ECL6 interface on the stimulatory ICL1/ICL4-R interaction were determined. The results showed that both Zn2+ bridges inhibited channel activity in a dose- and Cl--dependent manner, and the inhibition was reversed by a washout or suppressed by thiol-specific modification. Interestingly, their Cl--dependent Zn2+ inhibition was weakened at higher Zn2+ concentrations, their Zn2+ affinity was stronger in the resting state than in the activated state, and their activation current noises were decreased by external Zn2+ binding. More importantly, the external Zn2+ inhibition was reversed by internal curcumin in the R334C construct but not in the T1122C mutant. Therefore, although both Zn2+ bridges may promote channel closure, external Zn2+ may disturb the ECL1\textendash ECL6 interface and thus prevent the stimulatory ICL1/ICL4-R interaction and curcumin potentiation via a gating coupling between these two interfaces.},

  abstract = {Alzheimer disease (AD) is the most common type of dementia, and is currently incurable; existing treatments for AD produce only a modest amelioration of symptoms. Research into this disease has conventionally focused on the CNS. However, several peripheral and systemic abnormalities are now understood to be linked to AD, and our understanding of how these alterations contribute to AD is becoming more clearly defined. This Review focuses on amyloid-{$\beta$} (A{$\beta$}), a major hallmark of AD. We review emerging findings of associations between systemic abnormalities and A{$\beta$} metabolism, and describe how these associations might interact with or reflect on the central pathways of A{$\beta$} production and clearance. On the basis of these findings, we propose that these abnormal systemic changes might not only develop secondary to brain dysfunction but might also affect AD progression, suggesting that the interactions between the brain and the periphery have a crucial role in the development and progression of AD. Such a systemic view of the molecular pathogenesis of AD could provide a novel perspective for understanding this disease and present new opportunities for its early diagnosis and treatment.},

Here, we explore a thermodynamic strategy to correct the disease-causing F508del mutation in the human cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (hCFTR). F508del destabilizes nucleotide-binding domain 1 (hNBD1) in hCFTR relative to an aggregation-prone intermediate. We developed a fluorescence self-quenching assay for compounds that prevent aggregation of hNBD1 by stabilizing its native conformation. Unexpectedly, we found that dTTP and nucleotide analogs with exocyclic methyl groups bind to hNBD1 more strongly than ATP and preserve electrophysiological function of full-length F508del-hCFTR channels at temperatures up to 37 \textdegree C. Furthermore, nucleotides that increase open-channel probability, which reflects stabilization of an interdomain interface to hNBD1, thermally protect full-length F508del-hCFTR even when they do not stabilize isolated hNBD1. Therefore, stabilization of hNBD1 itself or of one of its interdomain interfaces by a small molecule indirectly offsets the destabilizing effect of the F508del mutation on full-length hCFTR. These results indicate that high-affinity binding of a small molecule to a remote site can correct a disease-causing mutation. We propose that the strategies described here should be applicable to identifying small molecules to help manage other human diseases caused by mutations that destabilize native protein conformation.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

However, the exact underlying molecular mechanism remains to be elucidated. Here, we reported that Nuclear Paraspeckle Assembly Transcript 1 (NEAT1), a long n on-coding RNA, exhibits repressed expression in the early stage of AD and its down-regulation declines neuroglial cell mediating A{$\beta$} clearance via inhibiting expression of endocytosis-related genes. We find that NEAT1 is associated with P300/CBP complex and its inhibition affects H3K27 acetylation (H3K27Ac) and H3K27 crotonylation (H3K27Cro) located nearby to the transcription start site of many genes, including endocytosis-related genes. Interestingly, NEAT1 inhibition down-regulates H3K27Ac but up-regulates H3K27Cro through repression of acetyl-CoA generation. NEAT1 also mediates the binding between STAT3 and H3K27Ac but not H3K27Cro. Therefore, the decrease of H3K27Ac and/or the increase of H3K27Cro declines expression of multiple related genes. Collectively, this study first reveals the different roles of H3K27Ac and H3K27Cro in regulation of gene expression and provides the insight of the epigenetic regulatory mechanism of NEAT1 in gene expression and AD pathology.},

G551D causes severe cystic fibrosis (CF) disease by disrupting ATP-dependent channel opening; however, whether G551D affects phosphorylation-dependent channel activation is unclear. Here, we use macropatch recording and Ussing chamber approaches to demonstrate that G551D impacts on phosphorylation-dependent activation of CFTR, and PKA-mediated phosphorylation regulates the interaction between the x-loop in nucleotide-binding domain 2 (NBD2) and cytosolic loop (CL) 1. We show that G551D not only disrupts ATP-dependent channel opening but also impairs phosphorylation-dependent channel activation by largely reducing PKA sensitivity consistent with the reciprocal relationship between channel opening/gating, ligand binding, and phosphorylation. Furthermore, we identified two novel GOF mutations: D1341R in the x-loop near the ATP-binding cassette signature motif in NBD2 and D173R in CL1, each of which strongly increased PKA sensitivity both in the wild-type (WT) background and when introduced into G551D-CFTR. When D1341R was combined with a second GOF mutation (e.g., K978C in CL3), we find that the double GOF mutation maximally increased G551D channel activity such that VX-770 had no further effect. We further show that a double chargereversal mutation of D1341R/D173R-CFTR exhibited similar PKA sensitivity when compared with WT-CFTR. Together, our results suggest that charge repulsion between D173 and D1341 of WT-CFTR normally inhibits channel activation at low PKA activity by reducing PKA sensitivity, and negative allostery by the G551D is coupled to reduced PKA sensitivity of CFTR that can be restored by second GOF mutations.},

Methods based on machine learning and artificial intelligence have been proposed over the years to deal with learning such low-dimensional manifolds, but they are often criticized for a disconnect from more traditional and physically interpretable approaches. To deal with such concerns, in this work we propose a deep learning based state predictive information bottleneck approach to learn the RC from high-dimensional molecular simulation trajectories. We demonstrate analytically and numerically how the RC learnt in this approach is connected to the committor in chemical physics and can be used to accurately identify transition states. A crucial hyperparameter in this approach is the time delay or how far into the future the algorithm should make predictions about. Through careful comparisons for benchmark systems, we demonstrate that this hyperparameter choice gives useful control over how coarse-grained we want the metastable state classification of the system to be. We thus believe that this work represents a step forward in systematic application of deep learning based ideas to molecular simulations.}

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Impaired mucociliary clearance characterises lung disease in cystic fibrosis (CF). Hypertonic saline enhances mucociliary clearance and may lessen the destructive inflammatory process in the airways. This is an update of a previously published review. OBJECTIVES: To investigate efficacy and tolerability of treatment with nebulised hypertonic saline on people with CF compared to placebo and or other treatments that enhance mucociliary clearance. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register, comprising references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches, handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. We also searched ongoing trials databases.Date of most recent searches: 08 August 2018. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials assessing hypertonic saline compared to placebo or other mucolytic therapy, for any duration or dose regimen in people with CF (any age or disease severity). DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently reviewed all identified trials and data, and assessed trial quality. The quality of the evidence was assessed using GRADE. MAIN RESULTS: A total of 17 trials (966 participants, aged 4 months to 63 years) were included; 19 trials were excluded, three trials are ongoing and 16 are awaiting classification. We judged 14 of the 17 included trials to have a high risk of bias due to participants ability to discern the taste of the solutions.Hypertonic saline 3\% to 7\% versus placeboAt four weeks, we found very low-quality evidence from three placebo-controlled trials (n = 225) that hypertonic saline (3\% to 7\%, 10 mL twice-daily) increased the mean change from baseline of the forced expiratory volume at one second (FEV1) (\% predicted) by 3.44\% (95\% confidence interval (CI) 0.67 to 6.21), but there was no difference between groups in lung clearance index in one small trial (n = 10). By 48 weeks the effect was slightly smaller in one trial (n = 134), 2.31\% (95\% CI -2.72 to 7.34) (low-quality evidence). No deaths occurred in the trials. Two trials reporting data on exacerbations were not combined as the age difference between the participants in the trials was too great. One trial (162 adults) found 0.5 fewer exacerbations requiring antibiotics per person in the hypertonic saline group; the second trial (243 children, average age of two years) found no difference between groups (low-quality evidence). There was insufficient evidence reported across the trials to determine the rate of different adverse events such as cough, chest tightness, tonsillitis and vomiting (very low-quality evidence). Four trials (n = 80) found very low-quality evidence that sputum clearance was better with hypertonic saline.A further trial was performed in adults with an acute exacerbation of lung disease (n = 132). The effects of hypertonic saline on short-term lung function, 5.10\% higher (14.67\% lower to 24.87\% higher) and the time to the subsequent exacerbation post-discharge, hazard ratio 0.86 (95\% CI 0.57 to 1.30) are uncertain (low-quality evidence). No deaths were reported. Cough and wheeze were reported but no serious adverse events (very low-quality evidence).Hypertonic saline versus mucus mobilising treatments Three trials compared a similar dose of hypertonic saline to recombinant deoxyribonuclease (rhDNase); two (61 participants) provided data for inclusion in the review. There was insufficient evidence from one three-week trial (14 participants) to determine the effects of hypertonic saline on FEV1 \% predicted, mean difference (MD) 1.60\% (95\% CI -7.96 to 11.16) (very low-quality evidence). In the second trial, rhDNase led to a greater increase in FEV1 \% predicted than hypertonic saline (5 mL twice daily) at 12 weeks in participants with moderate to severe lung disease, MD 8.00\% (95\% CI 2.00 to 14.00) (low-quality evidence). One cross-over trial (47 participants) reported 15 exacerbations during treatment with hypertonic saline and 18 exacerbations in the rhDNase group (low-quality evidence). Increased cough was reported in 13 participants using hypertonic saline and 17 on daily rhDNase in one cross-over trial of 47 people (low-quality evidence). There was insufficient evidence to assess rates of other adverse events reported. No deaths were reported.One trial (12 participants) compared hypertonic saline to amiloride and one (29 participants) to sodium-2-mercaptoethane sulphonate. Neither trial found a difference between treatments in any measures of sputum clearance; additionally the comparison of hypertonic saline and sodium-2-mercaptoethane sulphonate reported no differences in courses of antibiotics or adverse events (very low-quality evidence).One trial (12 participants) compared hypertonic saline to mannitol but did not report lung function at relevant time points for this review; there were no differences in sputum clearance, but mannitol was reported to be more 'irritating' (very low-quality evidence). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Regular use of nebulised hypertonic saline by adults and children over the age of 12 years with CF results in an improvement in lung function after four weeks (very low-quality evidence from three trials), but this was not sustained at 48 weeks (low-quality evidence from one trial). The review did show that nebulised hypertonic saline reduced the frequency of pulmonary exacerbations (although we found insufficient evidence for this outcome in children under six years of age) and may have a small effect on improvement in quality of life in adults.Evidence from one small cross-over trial in children indicates that rhDNase may lead to better lung function at three months; qualifying this we highlight that while the study did demonstrate that the improvement in FEV1 was greater with daily rHDNase, there were no differences seen in any of the secondary outcomes.Hypertonic saline does appear to be an effective adjunct to physiotherapy during acute exacerbations of lung disease in adults. However, for the outcomes assessed, the quality of the evidence ranged from very low to at best moderate, according to the GRADE criteria.},

Within the CNS, basic indications of drugs are: sleep disorders, anxiety, epilepsy, pain, etc. However, traditional channel blockers have multiple adverse events, mainly due to low specificity of mechanism of action. Lately, novel ion channel subtypes have been discovered, which gives premises to drug discovery process led towards specific channel subtypes. An example is Na+ channels, whose subtypes 1.3 and 1.7-1.9 are responsible for pain, and 1.1 and 1.2 \textendash{} for epilepsy. Moreover, new drug candidates have been recognized. This review is focusing on ion channels subtypes, which play a significant role in current drug discovery and development process. The knowledge on channel subtypes has developed rapidly, giving new nomenclatures of ion channels. For example, Ca2+ channels are not any more divided to T, L, N, P/Q, and R, but they are described as Cav1.1-Cav3.3, with even newer nomenclature {$\alpha$}1A-{$\alpha$}1I and {$\alpha$}1S. Moreover, new channels such as P2X1-P2X7, as well as TRPA1-TRPV1 have been discovered, giving premises for new types of analgesic drugs.},

The simulations show that depending on the orientation of the initial approach to the surface the protein may adsorb or bounce from the surface. The protein may completely leave the surface or reorient and approach the surface resulting in adsorption. The success of the trajectory to adsorb on the surface is the result of different competing interactions, including protein-surface interactions and the hydration of the protein and the hydrophobic PE surface. The difference in the hydration of various protein sites affects the protein's orientation-dependent behavior. Side-on orientation is most likely to result in adsorption as the protein-surface exhibits the strongest attraction. However, adsorption can also happen when lysozyme's longest axis is tilted on the surface if the protein-surface interaction is large enough to overcome the energy barrier that results from dehydrating both the protein and the surface. Our study demonstrates the significant role of dehydration process on hydrophobic surface during protein adsorption. \textcopyright{} 2012 American Chemical Society.}

We show that despite their thermodynamic differences, these ABCC transporter subtypes use broadly similar mechanisms to couple their extracellular gates to the ATP occupancies of their cytosolic nucleotide binding domains. A conserved extracellular phenylalanine at this gate was a prime location for producing gain of function (GOF) mutants of a long MRP in yeast (Ycf1p cadmium transporter), a short yeast MRP (Yor1p oligomycin exporter), and human CFTR channels. Extracellular gate mutations rescued ATP binding mutants of the yeast MRPs and CFTR by increasing ATP sensitivity. Control ATPase-defective MRP mutants could not be rescued by this mechanism. A CFTR double mutant with an extracellular gate mutation plus a cytosolic GOF mutation was highly active (single-channel open probability {$>$}0.3) in the absence of ATP and protein kinase A, each normally required for CFTR activity. We conclude that all 3 ABCC transporter subtypes use similar mechanisms to couple their extracellular gates to ATP occupancy, and highly active CFTR channels that bypass defects in ATP binding or phosphorylation can be produced.\textemdash Wei, S., Roessler, B.

Simulations and theory both indicate that the binding equilibrium constant K2D and the on- and off-rate constants of anchored receptors and ligands in their 2-dimensional (2D) membrane environment strongly depend on the membrane roughness from thermally excited shape fluctuations on nanoscales. Recent theory corroborated by simulations provides a general relation between K2D and the binding constant K3D of soluble variants of the receptors and ligands that lack the membrane anchors and are free to diffuse in 3 dimensions (3D).},

Published in 1998, 2006, and 2015, these guidelines represented the best information relevant to the appropriate selection of lung transplant candidates. A discussion of areas supported by the most robust scientific data will be undertaken, but in many aspects of recipient selection, there is a paucity of data upon which to rely. Therefore, it is ultimately the prerogative and responsibility of individual centers to determine, after carefully weighing the best evidence available, whether a patient is deemed a suitable candidate at a specific program.

Despite years of study, the heat activation mechanism of TRPV1 gating remains enigmatic at the molecular level. Toward elucidating the structural and energetic basis of TRPV1 gating, we have performed molecular dynamics (MD) simulations (with cumulative simulation time of 3 {$\mu$}s), starting from the high-resolution closed and open structures of TRPV1 solved by cryo-electron microscopy. In the closed-state simulations at 30\textdegree C, we observed a stably closed channel constricted at the lower gate (near residue I679), while the upper gate (near residues G643 and M644) is dynamic and undergoes flickery opening/closing. In the open-state simulations at 60\textdegree C, we found higher conformational variation consistent with a large entropy increase required for the heat activation, and both the lower and upper gates are dynamic with transient opening/closing. Through ensemble-based structural analyses of the closed state vs. the open state, we revealed pronounced closed-to-open conformational changes involving the membrane proximal domain (MPD) linker, the outer pore, and the TRP helix, which are accompanied by breaking/forming of a network of closed/open-state specific hydrogen bonds. By comparing the closed-state simulations at 30\textdegree C and 60\textdegree C, we observed heat-activated conformational changes in the MPD linker, the outer pore, and the TRP helix that resemble the closed-to-open conformational changes, along with partial formation of the open-state specific hydrogen bonds. Some of the residues involved in the above key hydrogen bonds were validated by previous mutational studies. Taken together, our MD simulations have offered rich structural and dynamic details beyond the static structures of TRPV1, and promising targets for future mutagenesis and functional studies of the TRPV1 channel.},

Nowadays, as a powerful computation tool, molecular docking has been widely utilized to predict the binding structures of protein-peptide complexes. However, although a number of docking programs have been available, the systematic study on the assessment of their performance for PpIs has never been reported. In this study, a benchmark data set called PepSet consisting of 185 protein-peptide complexes with peptide length ranging from 5 to 20 residues was employed to evaluate the performance of 14 docking programs, including three protein-protein docking programs (ZDOCK, FRODOCK, and HawkDock), three small molecule docking programs (GOLD, Surflex-Dock, and AutoDock Vina), and eight protein-peptide docking programs (GalaxyPepDock, MDockPeP, HPEPDOCK, CABS-dock, pepATTRACT, DINC, AutoDock CrankPep (ADCP), and HADDOCK peptide docking). A new evaluation parameter, named IL\_RMSD, was proposed to measure the docking accuracy with fnat (the fraction of native contacts). In global docking, HPEPDOCK performs the best for the entire data set and yields the success rates of 4.3\%, 24.3\%, and 55.7\% at the top 1, 10, and 100 levels, respectively. In local docking, overall, ADCP achieves the best predictions and reaches the success rates of 11.9\%, 37.3\%, and 70.3\% at the top 1, 10, and 100 levels, respectively. It is expected that our work can provide some helpful insights into the selection and development of improved docking programs for PpIs.

  abstract = {Disease modeling is increasingly being used to evaluate the effect of health intervention strategies, particularly for infectious diseases. However, the utility and application of such models are hampered by the inconsistent use of infectious disease modeling terms between and within disciplines. We sought to standardize the lexicon of infectious disease modeling terms and develop a glossary of terms commonly used in describing models' assumptions, parameters, variables, and outcomes. We combined a comprehensive literature review of relevant terms with an online forum discussion in a virtual community of practice, mod4PH (Modeling for Public Health). Using a convergent discussion process and consensus amongst the members of mod4PH, a glossary of terms was developed as an online resource. We anticipate that the glossary will improve inter- and intradisciplinary communication and will result in a greater uptake and understanding of disease modeling outcomes in heath policy decision-making. We highlight the role of the mod4PH community of practice and the methodologies used in this endeavor to link theory, policy, and practice in the public health domain.},

Nevertheless, our current understanding of how each of these components affects the properties of the cell membrane remains elusive, in part due to the difficulties in studying the dynamics of membranes at high spatiotemporal resolution. In this work, we use coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations to investigate how individual lipid species contribute to the biophysical properties of the neuronal plasma membrane. We progress through eight membranes of increasing chemical complexity, ranging from a simple POPC/CHOL membrane to a previously published neuronal plasma membrane [Ing\'olfsson, H. I., et al. (2017) Biophys. J. 113 (10), 2271-2280] containing 49 distinct lipid species. Our results show how subtle chemical changes can affect the properties of the membrane and highlight the lipid species that give the neuronal plasma membrane its unique biophysical properties. This work has potential far-reaching implications for furthering our understanding of cell membranes.}

Plasmalogen lipids, Forssman glycosphingolipids, and hydroxylated Forssman glycosphingolipids and sphingomyelin were systematically added to determine their structural effects. Plasmalogen lipids have a minimal effect on the overall biophysical properties of the epithelial plasma membrane. In line with the hypothesized role of Forssman lipids in the epithelial apical membrane, the introduction of Forssman lipids initiates the formation of glycosphingolipid-rich nanoscale lipid domains, which also include phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), sphingomyelin (SM), and cholesterol (CHOL). This decreases the lateral diffusion in the extracellular leaflet, as well as the area per lipid of domain forming lipids, most notably PE. Finally, hydroxylation of the Forssman glycosphingolipids and sphingomyelin further modulates the lateral organization of the membrane. Through comparison to the previously studied average and neuronal plasma membranes, the impact of membrane lipid composition on membrane properties was characterized. Overall, this study furthers our understanding of the biophysical properties of complex membranes and the impact of lipid diversity in modulating membrane properties.},

These new advances in DNA manipulation have been extended to the level of whole-genome synthesis, as evident from the synthesis of poliovirus, from the resurrection of the extinct 1918 strain of influenza virus and of human endogenous retroviruses and from the restructuring of the phage T7 genome. The largest DNA synthesized so far is the 582,970 base pair genome of Mycoplasma genitalium, although, as yet, this synthetic DNA has not been 'booted' to life. As genome synthesis is independent of a natural template, it allows modification of the structure and function of a virus's genetic information to an extent that was hitherto impossible. The common goal of this new strategy is to further our understanding of an organism's properties, particularly its pathogenic armory if it causes disease in humans, and to make use of this new information to protect from, or treat, human viral disease. Although only a few applications of virus synthesis have been described as yet, key recent findings have been the resurrection of the 1918 influenza virus and the generation of codon-and codon pair-deoptimized polioviruses. \textcopyright{} 2009 Nature America, Inc.

Recently, machine-learning scoring functions trained on protein-ligand complexes have shown great promise in small tailored studies. They have also raised controversy, specifically concerning model overfitting and applicability to novel targets. Here we provide a new ready-to-use scoring function (RF-Score-VS) trained on 15 426 active and 893 897 inactive molecules docked to a set of 102 targets. We use the full DUD-E data sets along with three docking tools, five classical and three machine-learning scoring functions for model building and performance assessment. Our results show RF-Score-VS can substantially improve virtual screening performance: RF-Score-VS top 1\% provides 55.6\% hit rate, whereas that of Vina only 16.2\% (for smaller percent the difference is even more encouraging: RF-Score-VS top 0.1\% achieves 88.6\% hit rate for 27.5\% using Vina). In addition, RFScore- VS provides much better prediction of measured binding affinity than Vina (Pearson correlation of 0.56 and -0.18, respectively). Lastly, we test RF-Score-VS on an independent test set from the DEKOIS benchmark and observed comparable results. We provide full data sets to facilitate further research in this area (http://github.com/oddt/rfscorevs) as well as ready-to-use RF-Score-VS (http://github.com/oddt/rfscorevs-binary).},

Molecular dynamics of I37R using an extended model of the phosphorylated, ATP-bound human CFTR identified an altered lasso motif conformation which results in an unfavorable strengthening of the interactions between the lasso motif, the regulatory (R) domain, and the transmembrane domain 2 (TMD2).

  abstract = {A significant challenge to making targeted CFTR modulator therapies accessible to all individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF) are many mutations in the CFTR gene that can cause CF, most of which remain uncharacterized. Here, we characterized the structural and functional defects of the rare CFTR mutation R352Q - with potential role contributing to intrapore chloride ion permeation - in patient-derived cell models of the airway and gut. CFTR function in differentiated nasal epithelial cultures and matched intestinal organoids was assessed using ion transport assay and forskolin-induced swelling (FIS) assay respectively. CFTR potentiators (VX-770, GLPG1837 and VX-445) and correctors (VX-809, VX-445 +/- VX-661) were tested. Data from R352Q-CFTR were compared to that of twenty participants with mutations with known impact on CFTR function. R352Q-CFTR has residual CFTR function which was restored to functional CFTR activity by CFTR potentiators but not the corrector. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of R352Q-CFTR were carried out which indicated the presence of a chloride conductance defect, with little evidence supporting a gating defect. The combination approach of in vitro patient-derived cell models and in silico MD simulations to characterize rare CFTR mutations can improve the specificity and sensitivity of modulator response predictions and aid in their translational use for CF precision medicine.

Such calculations are of particular importance in protein-ligand free-energy calculations. To meet this challenge, we have developed new free-energy techniques that combine the advantages of the replica-exchange method with free-energy perturbation (FEP) and finite-difference thermodynamic integration (FDTI). These new techniques are tested and compared with FEP, FDTI, and the adaptive umbrella weighted histogram analysis method (AdUmWHAM) on the challenging calculation of the relative hydration free energy of methane and water. This calculation involves a large solvent configurational change. Through the use of replica-exchange moves along the {$\lambda$}-coordinate, the configurations sampled along {$\lambda$} are allowed to mix, which leads to dramatic improvements in solvent configurational sampling, an efficient reduction of random sampling error, and a reduction of general simulation error. This is achieved at effectively no extra computational cost, relative to standard FEP or FDTI.}

All of these particular motoric and behavioral symptoms may arise from Parkinson's disease [PD] per se, but they can also characterize Lewy Body dementia [LBD] or concurrent Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases [PD \& AD]. Abnormalities of both movement and cognition are also observed in numerous other neurologic diseases, for example Huntington's Disease and the frontotemporal dementia. Distinguishing among these diseases in an individual patient is important in "personalizing" his or her mode of treatment, since an agent that is often highly effective in one of the diagnoses (e.g., L-dopa or muscarinic antagonists in PD) might be ineffective or even damaging in one of the others. That such personalization, based on genetic, biochemical, and imaging-based biomarkers, is feasible is suggested by the numerous genetic abnormalities already discovered in patients with parkinsonism, Alzheimer's disease and Huntington's disease (HD) and by the variety of regional and temporal patterns that these diseases can produce, as shown using imaging techniques.},

  abstract = {Ionic liquids (ILs) have proven effective solvents for pretreating lignocellulose, leading to the fast saccharification of cellulose and hemicellulose. However, the high cost of most ILs remains a major barrier to commercializing this recent approach at a practical scale. As a strategic detour, aqueous solutions of ILs are also being explored as less costly alternatives to neat ILs for cellulose pretreatment. However, limited studies on a few select IL systems are known and there remains no systematic survey of various ILs, eluding an in-depth understanding of pretreatment mechanisms afforded by aqueous IL systems. As a step toward filling this gap, this study presents results for Avicel cellulose pretreatment by neat and aqueous solutions (1.0 and 2.0 M) of 20 different ILs and three deep eutectic solvents, correlating enzymatic hydrolysis rates of pretreated cellulose with various IL properties such as hydrogen-bond basicity, polarity, Hofmeister ranking, and hydrophobicity. The pretreatment efficiencies of neat ILs may be loosely correlated to the hydrogen-bond basicity of the constituent anion and IL polarity; however, the pretreatment efficacies for aqueous ILs are more complicated and cannot be simply related to any single IL property. Several aqueous IL systems have been identified as effective alternatives to neat ILs in lignocellulose pretreatment. In particular, this study reveals that aqueous solutions of 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium methanesulfonate ([BMIM][MeSO 3]) are effective for pretreating switchgrass (Panicum virgatum), resulting in fast saccharification of both cellulose and hemicellulose. An integrated analysis afforded by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, thermogravimetric analysis and cellulase adsorption isotherm of lignocellulose samples is further used to deliver a more complete view of the structural changes attending aqueous IL pretreatment. \textcopyright{} 2014 The Royal Society of Chemistry.}

MLN4924, a selective NAE inhibitor, has displayed preclinical anti-tumor activity in vitro and in vivo, and promising clinical activity has been reported in patients with refractory hematologic malignancies. Here, we sought to understand the mechanisms of resistance to MLN4924. K562 and U937 leukemia cells were exposed over a 6 month period to MLN4924 and populations of resistant cells (R-K562 MLN, R-U937MLN) were selected. R-K562MLN and R-U937MLN cells contain I310N and Y352H mutations in the NAE catalytic subunit UBA3, respectively. Biochemical analyses indicate that these mutations increase the enzyme's affinity for ATP while decreasing its affinity for NEDD8. These mutations effectively contribute to decreased MLN4924 potency in vitro while providing for sufficient NAE function for leukemia cell survival. Finally, R-K562MLN cells showed cross-resistance to other NAE-selective inhibitors, but remained sensitive to a pan-E1 (activating enzyme) inhibitor. Thus, our work provides insight into mechanisms of MLN4924 resistance to facilitate the development of more effective second-generation NAE inhibitors. \textcopyright{} 2014 Xu et al.},

We evaluate our methodology for the GRP1 PH domain via comparison with structural and biophysical data. Coarse-grained simulations yield a 2D density landscape for PH/membrane interactions alongside residue contact profiles. Predictions of the membrane localization and interactions of 13 PH domains reveal canonical, non-canonical, and dual PIP-binding sites on the proteins. Thus, the PH domains associate with the PIP molecules in the membrane via a highly positively charged loop. Some PH domains exhibit modes of interaction with PIP-containing membranes additional to this canonical binding mode. All 13 PH domains cause a degree of local clustering of PIP molecules upon binding to the membrane. This provides a global picture of PH domain interactions with membranes. The high-throughput approach could be extended to other families of peripheral membrane proteins.}

The deletion of a phenylalanine at residue 508 (F508del) is the most common mutation that causes cellular processing, chloride channel gating and protein stability defects in CFTR. Pharmacological modulators of F508del-CFTR, aimed at correcting the cellular processing defect (correctors) and the gating defect (potentiators) in CFTR protein, are regarded as promising therapeutic agents for CF disease. Endeavors in searching F508del-CFTR modulators have shown encouraging results, with several small-molecule compounds having entered clinical trials or even represented clinical options. Areas covered: This review covers the discovery of F508del-CFTR correctors described in both patents (2005 - present) and scientific literatures. Expert opinion: Cyclopropane carboxamide derivatives of CFTR correctors continue to dominate in this area, among which lumacaftor (a NBD1-MSD1/2 interface stabilizer) is the most promising compound and is now under the priority review by US FDA. However, the abrogation effect of ivacaftor (potentiator) on lumacaftor suggests the requirement of discovering new correctors and potentiators that can cooperate well. Integration screening for simultaneously identifying combinations of correctors (particularly NBD1 stabilizer) and potentiators should provide an alternative strategy. A recently reported natural product fraction library may be useful for the integration screening.},

CFTR has presented a formidable challenge to obtain monodisperse, biophysically stable protein. Here we report a comprehensive study comparing effects of single and multiple NBD1 mutations on stability of both the NBD1 domain alone and on purified full length human CFTR. Single mutations S492P, A534P, I539T acted additively, and when combined with M470V, S495P, and R555K cumulatively yielded an NBD1 with highly improved structural stability. Strategic combinations of these mutations strongly stabilized the domain to attain a calorimetric Tm \textbackslash textgreater 70 \textdegree C. Replica exchange molecular dynamics simulations on the most stable 6SS-NBD1 variant implicated fluctuations, electrostatic interactions and side chain packing as potential contributors to improved stability. Progressive stabilization of NBD1 directly correlated with enhanced structural stability of full-length CFTR protein. Thermal unfolding of the stabilized CFTR mutants, monitored by changes in intrinsic fluorescence, demonstrated that Tm could be shifted as high as 67.4 \textdegree C in 6SS-CFTR, more than 20 \textdegree C higher than wild-type. H1402S, an NBD2 mutation, conferred CFTR with additional thermal stability, possibly by stabilizing an NBD-dimerized conformation. CFTR variants with NBD1-stabilizing mutations were expressed at the cell surface in mammalian cells, exhibited ATPase and channel activity, and retained these functions to higher temperatures. The capability to produce enzymatically active CFTR with improved structural stability amenable to biophysical and structural studies will advance mechanistic investigations and future cystic fibrosis drug development.},

In this perspective, we review a variety of enhanced sampling methods. We first discuss collective-variables-based methods including metadynamics and variationally enhanced sampling. Then, collective variable free methods such as parallel tempering and integrated tempering methods are presented. At last, we conclude with a brief introduction of some newly developed combinatory methods.

  abstract = {Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation has become a powerful tool because it provides a time series of protein dynamics at high temporal-spatial resolution. However, the accessible timescales of MD simulation are shorter than those of the biologically rare events. Generally, long-time MD simulations over microseconds are required to detect the rare events. Therefore, it is desirable to develop rare-event-sampling methods. For a rare-event-sampling method, we have developed parallel cascade selection MD (PaCS-MD). PaCS-MD generates transition pathways from a given source structure to a target structure by repeating short-time MD simulations. The key point in PaCS-MD is how to select reasonable candidates (protein configurations) with high potentials to make transitions toward the target structure. In the present study, based on principal component analysis (PCA), we propose PCA-based PaCS-MD to detect rare events of collective motions of a given protein. Here, the PCA-based PaCS-MD is composed of the following two steps. At first, as a preliminary run, PCA is performed using an MD trajectory from the target structure to define a principal coordinate (PC) subspace for describing the collective motions of interest. PCA provides principal modes as eigenvectors to project a protein configuration onto the PC subspace. Then, as a production run, all the snapshots of short-time MD simulations are ranked by inner products (IPs), where an IP is defined between a snapshot and the target structure. Then, snapshots with higher values of the IP are selected as reasonable candidates, and short-time MD simulations are independently restarted from them. By referring to the values of the IP, the PCA-based PaCS-MD repeats the short-time MD simulations from the reasonable candidates that are highly correlated with the target structure. As a demonstration, we applied the PCA-based PaCS-MD to adenylate kinase and detected its large-amplitude (open-closed) transition with a nanosecond-order computational cost.},

  abstract = {Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is unique among ion channels in that after its phosphorylation by protein kinase A (PKA), its ATP-dependent gating violates microscopic reversibility caused by the intimate involvement of ATP hydrolysis in controlling channel closure. Recent studies suggest a gating model featuring an energetic coupling between opening and closing of the gate in CFTR's transmembrane domains and association and dissociation of its two nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs). We found that permeant ions such as nitrate can increase the open probability (Po) of wild-type (WT) CFTR by increasing the opening rate and decreasing the closing rate. Nearly identical effects were seen with a construct in which activity does not require phosphorylation of the regulatory domain, indicating that nitrate primarily affects ATP-dependent gating steps rather than PKA-dependent phosphorylation. Surprisingly, the effects of nitrate on CFTR gating are remarkably similar to those of VX-770 (N-(2,4-Di-tert-butyl-5-hydroxyphenyl)-4-oxo-1,4-dihydroquinoline-3-carboxamide), a potent CFTR potentiator used in clinics. These include effects on single-channel kinetics of WT CFTR, deceleration of the nonhydrolytic closing rate, and potentiation of the Po of the disease-associated mutant G551D. In addition, both VX-770 and nitrate increased the activity of a CFTR construct lacking NBD2 ({$\Delta$}NBD2), indicating that these gating effects are independent of NBD dimerization. Nonetheless, whereas VX-770 is equally effective when applied from either side of the membrane, nitrate potentiates gating mainly from the cytoplasmic side, implicating a common mechanism for gating modulation mediated through two separate sites of action.},

  abstract = {Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a channelopathy caused by loss-of-function mutations of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene, which encodes a phosphorylation-activated and adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-gated chloride channel. In the past few years, high-throughput drug screening has successfully realized the first US Food and Drug Administration-approved therapy for CF, called ivacaftor (or VX-770). A more recent CFTR potentiator, GLPG1837 (N-(3-carbamoyl-5,5,7,7-tetramethyl-4,7-dihydro-5H-thieno[2,3-c] pyran-2-yl)-1H-pyrazole-3-carboxamide), has been shown to exhibit a higher efficacy than ivacaftor for the G551D mutation, yet the underlying mechanism of GLPG1837 remains unclear. Here we find that despite their differences in potency and efficacy, GLPG1837 and VX-770 potentiate CFTR gating in a remarkably similar manner. Specifically, they share similar effects on single-channel kinetics of wild-type CFTR. Their actions are independent of nucleotide-binding domain (NBD) dimerization and ATP hydrolysis, critical steps controlling CFTR's gate opening and closing, respectively. By applying the two reagents together, we provide evidence that GLPG1837 and VX-770 likely compete for the same site, whereas GLPG1837 and the high-affinity ATP analogue 2'-deoxy-N6-(2-phenylethyl)-adenosine-5'-O-triphosphate (dPATP) work synergistically through two different sites. We also find that the apparent affinity for GLPG1837 is dependent on the open probability of the channel, suggesting a state-dependent binding of the drug to CFTR (higher binding affinity for the open state than the closed state), which is consistent with the classic mechanism for allosteric modulation. We propose a simple four-state kinetic model featuring an energetic coupling between CFTR gating and potentiator binding to explain our experimental results.},

  abstract = {The past two decades have witnessed major breakthroughs in developing compounds that target the chloride channel CFTR for the treatment of patients with cystic fibrosis. However, further improvement in affinity and efficacy for these CFTR modulators will require insights into the molecular interactions between CFTR modulators and their binding targets. In this study, we use in silico molecular docking to identify potential binding sites for GLPG1837, a CFTR potentiator that may share a common mechanism and binding site with VX-770, the FDA-approved drug for patients carrying mutations with gating defects. Among the five binding sites predicted by docking, the two top-scoring sites are located at the interface between CFTR's two transmembrane domains: Site I consists of D924, N1138, and S1141, and site IIN includes F229, F236, Y304, F312, and F931. Using mutagenesis to probe the importance of these sites for GLPG187 binding, we find that disruption of predicted hydrogenbonding interactions by mutation of D924 decreases apparent affinity, while hydrophobic amino acids substitutions at N1138 and introduction of positively charged amino acids at S1141 improve the apparent affinity for GLPG1837. Alanine substitutions at Y304, F312, and F931 (site IIN) decrease the affinity for GLPG1837, whereas alanine substitutions at F229 and F236 (also site IIN), or at residues in the other three lower-scoring sites, have little effect. In addition, current relaxation analysis to assess the apparent dissociation rate of VX-770 yields results consistent with the dose-response experiments for GLPG8137, with the dissociation rate of VX-770 accelerated by D924N, F236A, Y304A, and F312A, but decelerated by N1138L and S1141K mutations. Collectively, these data identify two potential binding sites for GLPG1837 and VX-770 in CFTR.

  abstract = {Opening of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) channel is coupled to the motion of its two nucleotide-binding domains: they form a heterodimer sandwiching two functionally distinct ATP-binding sites (sites 1 and 2). While active ATP hydrolysis in site 2 triggers rapid channel closure, the functional role of stable ATP binding in the catalysis-incompetent (or degenerate) site 1, a feature conserved in many other ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter proteins, remains elusive. Here, we found that CFTR loses its prompt responsiveness to ATP after the channel is devoid of ATP for tens to hundreds of seconds. Mutants with weakened ATP binding in site 1 and the most prevalent disease-causing mutation, F508del, are more vulnerable to ATP depletion. In contrast, strengthening ligand binding in site 1 with N6-(2-phenylethyl)-ATP, a high-affinity ATP analogue, or abolishing ATP hydrolysis in site 2 by the mutation D1370N, helps sustain a durable function of the otherwise unstable mutant channels. Thus, tight binding of ATP in the degenerate ATP-binding site is crucial to the functional stability of CFTR. Small molecules targeting site 1 may bear therapeutic potential to overcome the membrane instability of F508del-CFTR. Key points During evolution, many ATP-binding cassette transporters \textendash{} including the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) chloride channel, whose dysfunction causes cystic fibrosis (CF) \textendash{} lose the ability to hydrolyse ATP in one of the two ATP-binding sites. Here we show that tight ATP binding at this degenerate site in CFTR is central for maintaining the stable, robust function of normal CFTR. We also demonstrate that membrane instability of the most common CF-causing mutant, F508del-CFTR, can be rescued by strengthening ATP binding at CFTR's degenerate site. Our data thus explain an evolutionary puzzle and offer a potential therapeutic strategy for CF.},

Tremendous progress has been made in both basic and clinical sciences over the past three decades since the identification of the CFTR gene. Over 90\% of people with CF now have access to therapies targeting dysfunctional CFTR. This success was made possible by numerous studies in the field that incrementally paved the way for the development of small molecules known as CFTR modulators. The advent of CFTR modulators transformed this life-threatening illness into a treatable disease by directly binding to the CFTR protein and correcting defects induced by pathogenic variants. In this chapter, we trace the trajectory of structural and functional studies that brought CF therapies from bench to bedside, with an emphasis on mechanistic understanding of CFTR modulators.},

Our structures combined with single-channel recordings, molecular dynamics simulations and machine-learning analysis suggest that channel opening requires agonist binding to at least two LBDs. Conversely, agonist binding to all four LBDs does not guarantee maximal channel conductance and favours subconductance states O1 and O2, with O3 and O4 being rare and not captured structurally. The lack of subunit independence and low efficiency coupling of glutamate binding to channel opening underlie the gating of synaptic complexes to submaximal conductance levels, which provide a potential for upregulation of synaptic activity.},

Here, we provide a classification of structurally characterized binding sites in TRPV channels and discuss the progress that has been made by structural biology combined with mutagenesis, functional recordings, and molecular dynamics simulations toward understanding of the molecular mechanisms of ligand action. Given the similarity in structural architecture of TRP channels, 16 unique sites identified in TRPV channels may be shared between TRP channel subfamilies, although the chemical identity of a particular ligand will likely depend on the local amino-acid composition. The characterized binding sites and molecular mechanisms of ligand action create a diversity of druggable targets to aid in the design of new molecules for tuning TRP channel function in disease conditions.}

The impact of such dysfunction is felt across the entire proteome and is not restricted to a small subset of proteins. Proteome imbalance may cause functional defects, such as excitability alterations, and eventually cell death.

A general chemical pattern-matching engine using this graph has been implemented whereby assignment of molecular mechanics atom types, charges, and force field parameters are achieved by comparison against a customizable list of chemical fragments. While initially designed to complement the CHARMM simulation package and force fields by generating the necessary input topology and atom-type data files, MATCH can be expanded to any force field and program, and has core functionality that makes it extendable to other applications such as fragment-based property prediction. In this work, we demonstrate the accurate construction of atomic parameters of molecules within each force field included in CHARMM36 through exhaustive cross validation studies illustrating that bond charge increment rules derived from one force field can be transferred to another. In addition, using leave-one-out substitution it is shown that it is also possible to substitute missing intra and intermolecular parameters with ones included in a force field to complete the parameterization of novel molecules. Finally, to demonstrate the robustness of MATCH and the coverage of chemical space offered by the recent CHARMM general force field (Vanommeslaeghe, et al., J Comput Chem 2010, 31, 671), one million molecules from the PubChem database of small molecules are typed, parameterized, and minimized. \textcopyright{} 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

A further therapeutic option available for moderate to severe AD is memantine, an N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor noncompetitive antagonist. Treatments capable of stopping or at least effectively modifying the course of AD, referred to as `disease-modifying' drugs, are still under extensive research. To block the progression of the disease they have to interfere with the pathogenic steps responsible for the clinical symptoms, including the deposition of extracellular amyloid {$\beta$} plaques and intracellular neurofibrillary tangle formation, inflammation, oxidative damage, iron deregulation and cholesterol metabolism.

Here we report the crystal structure of Ragulator in complex with the roadblock domains of RagA-C, which helps to elucidate the molecular basis for the regulation of Rag GTPases. In the structure, p18 wraps around the three pairs of roadblock heterodimers to tandemly assemble them onto lysosomes. Cellular and in vitro analyses further demonstrate that p18 is required for Ragulator-Rag GTPase assembly and amino acid-dependent activation of mTORC1.

Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have been used to study such interactions, however, the accuracy of the Ca(2+) models provided by the standard MD force fields has not been rigorously tested. Here, we assess the performance of the Ca(2+) models from the most popular classical force fields AMBER and CHARMM by computing the osmotic pressure of model compounds and the free energy of DNA-DNA interactions. In the simulations performed using the two standard models, Ca(2+) ions are seen to form artificial clusters with chloride, acetate, and phosphate species; the osmotic pressure of CaAc2 and CaCl2 solutions is a small fraction of the experimental values for both force fields. Using the standard parameterization of Ca(2+) ions in the simulations of Ca(2+) -mediated DNA-DNA interactions leads to qualitatively wrong outcomes: both AMBER and CHARMM simulations suggest strong inter-DNA attraction whereas, in experiment, DNA molecules repel one another. The artificial attraction of Ca(2+) to DNA phosphate is strong enough to affect the direction of the electric field-driven translocation of DNA through a solid-state nanopore. To address these shortcomings of the standard Ca(2+) model, we introduce a custom model of a hydrated Ca(2+) ion and show that using our model brings the results of the above MD simulations in quantitative agreement with experiment. Our improved model of Ca(2+) can be readily applied to MD simulations of various biomolecular systems, including nucleic acids, proteins and lipid bilayer membranes. \textcopyright{} 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The key to folding of a biopolymer into a unique 3D structure or to an assembly of several biopolymers into a functional unit is a delicate balance between the attractive and repulsive forces that also makes such self-assembly reversible under physiological conditions. The all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) method has emerged as a powerful tool for studies of individual biomolecules and their functional assemblies, encompassing systems of ever increasing complexity. However, advances in parallel computing technology have outpaced the development of the underlying theoretical models - the molecular force fields, pushing the MD method into an untested territory. Recent tests of the MD method have found the most commonly used molecular force fields to be out of balance, overestimating attractive interactions between charged and hydrophobic groups, which can promote artificial aggregation in MD simulations of multi-component protein, nucleic acid, and lipid systems. One route towards improving the force fields is through the NBFIX corrections method, in which the intermolecular forces are calibrated against experimentally measured quantities such as osmotic pressure by making atom pair-specific adjustments to the non-bonded interactions. In this article, we review development of the NBFIX (Non-Bonded FIX) corrections to the AMBER and CHARMM force fields and discuss their implications for MD simulations of electrolyte solutions, dense DNA systems, Holliday junctions, protein folding, and lipid bilayer membranes.}

Umbrella sampling (US), a widely used free energy calculation method, has long been used to explore the dissociation process of ligand\textendash receptor systems and compute binding free energy. In existing publications, the binding free energy computed from the potential of mean force (PMF) with US simulation mostly yielded ``ball park'' values with experimental data. However, the computed PMF values are highly influenced by factors such as initial conformations and/or trajectories provided, the reaction coordinate, and sampling of conformational space in each US window. These critical factors have rarely been carefully studied. Here we used US to study the guest aspirin and 1-butanol dissociation processes of {$\beta$}-cyclodextrin ({$\beta$}-CD) and an inhibitor SB2 dissociation from a p38{$\alpha$} mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) complex. For {$\beta$}-CD, we used three different {$\beta$}-CD conformations to generate the dissociation path with US windows. For p38{$\alpha$}, we generated the dissociation pathway by using accelerated molecular dynamics followed by conformational relaxing with short conventional MD, steered MD, and manual pulling. We found that, even for small {$\beta$}-CD complexes, different {$\beta$}-CD conformations altered the height of the PMF, but the pattern of PMF was not affected if the MD sampling in each US window was well-converged. Because changing the macrocyclic ring conformation needs to rotate dihedral angles in the ring, a bound ligand largely restrains the motion of cyclodextrin. Therefore, once a guest is in the binding site, cyclodextrin cannot freely change its initial conformation, resulting in different absolute heights of the PMF, which cannot be overcome by running excessively long MD simulations for each US window. Moreover, if the US simulations were not converged, the important barrier and minimum were missed. For ligand\textendash protein systems, our studies also suggest that the dissociation trajectories modeled by an enhanced sampling method must maintain a natural molecular movement to avoid biased PMF plots when using US simulations.}

Characterizations of the gating defects of R117H-CFTR led to the conclusion that the mutation decreases Po by perturbing the gating conformational changes in CFTR's transmembrane domains (TMDs) without altering the function of the nucleotide binding domains (NBDs). Nonetheless, gating of the R117H-CFTR can be improved by a variety of pharmacological reagents supposedly acting on NBDs such as ATP analogues, or TMDs (e.g. VX-770 or nitrate). These reagents potentiate synergistically R117H-CFTR gating to a level that allows accurate assessments of its gating deficits. Our studies not only elucidate the mechanism underpinning gating dysfunction of R117H-CFTR, but also provide a mechanistic understanding of how VX-770 ameliorates the gating defects in the R117H mutant. Abstract: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is caused by loss-of-function mutations of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene encoding a phosphorylation-activated, but ATP-gated chloride channel. In the current study, we investigated the mechanism responsible for the gating defects manifested in R117H-CFTR, an arginine-to-histidine substitution at position 117 of CFTR that is associated with mild forms of CF. We confirmed previous findings of a 25\% decrease of the single-channel conductance (g) in R117H-CFTR, but found a {$\sim$}13-fold lower open probability (Po). This dramatic gating deficit is not due to dysfunctional nucleotide binding domains (NBDs) as the mutation does not alter the apparent affinity for ATP, and the mutant channels respond to ATP analogues in a similar manner as wild-type CFTR. Furthermore, once ATP hydrolysis is abolished, the R117H mutant can be trapped in a prolonged `burst opening' conformation that is proposed to be equipped with a stable NBD dimer. On the other hand, our results support the conclusion that the R117H mutation decreases Po by perturbing the gating conformational changes in CFTR's transmembrane domains as even when NBDs are kept at a dimerized configuration, Po is reduced by {$\sim$}10-fold. Moreover, our data demonstrate that a synergistic improvement of R117H-CFTR function can be accomplished with a combined regiment of VX-770 (Ivacaftor), nitrate ion (NO3-) and N6-(2-phenylethyl)-2{${'}$}-deoxy-ATP (d-PATP), which almost completely rectifies the gating defect of R117H-CFTR. Clinical implications of our results are discussed.}

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) exhibits two conductance states, 9 picosiemens (pS) and 3 pS. To investigate the origin of these two distinct conductance states, we measured the single-channel activity of three truncated forms of CFTR. These include: TNR, which contains the first transmembrane domain, the first nucleotide binding domain, and the R domain; RT2N2, which contains the R domain, the second transmembrane domain, and the second nucleotide-binding domain; and T2N2, which contains only the second transmembrane domain and the second nucleotide-binding domain. The results show that TNR exhibits only the large conductance of 9.2 pS, whereas RT2N2 and T2N2 exhibit only the small conductance (3.8\textendash 4.0 pS). Co-expression of TNR with T2N2 resulted in a mixed pattern of two conductance states, which is similar to that observed in wild-type CFTR. In further studies, a "dual-R mutant," R334W and R347P in the transmembrane segment 6 of the first half of CFTR, severely impaired the large conductance channel without affecting the small conductance channel. The ion selectivity and gating behavior of the two conductance channels are different regardless of whether they are measured in wild-type CFTR or in truncated CFTRs. The ion selectivity of the large conductance channel is Br\textsuperscript{-} {$>$} Cl\textsuperscript{-} {$>$} I\textsuperscript{-}, whereas the ion selectivity of the small conductance channel is Br\textsuperscript{-} = Cl\textsuperscript{-} = I\textsuperscript{-}. The open probability (\emph{P\textsubscript{o}}) of the large conductance is about 4-fold higher than that of the small conductance. Transition from closed to open states of the small conductance is not dependent upon the open or closed states of the large conductance. The independent behaviors of the two conductances in CFTR strongly suggest that CFTR may have two distinct pores. Thus, like ClC0, CFTR is likely to be a double-barreled ion channel, with the first half of CFTR forming the large conductance and the second half forming the small conductance.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {In the past two decades, transmembrane channel-like (TMC) proteins have attracted a significant amount of research interest, because mutations of Tmc1 lead to hereditary deafness. As evolutionarily conserved membrane proteins, TMC proteins are widely involved in diverse sensorimotor functions of many species, such as hearing, chemosensation, egg laying, and food texture detection. Interestingly, recent structural and physiological studies suggest that TMC channels may share a similar membrane topology with the Ca2+-activated Cl- channel TMEM16 and the mechanically activated OSCA1.2/TMEM63 channel. Namely, these channels form dimers and each subunit consists of ten transmembrane segments. Despite this important structural insight, a key question remains: what is the gating mechanism of TMC channels? The major technical hurdle to answer this question is that the reconstitution of TMC proteins as functional ion channels has been challenging in mammalian heterologous systems. Since TMC channels are conserved across taxa, genetic studies of TMC channels in model organisms such as C. elegans, Drosophila, and zebrafish may provide us critical information on the physiological function and regulation of TMCs. Here, we present a comparative overview on the diverse functions of TMC channels in different species.},

It calls for a formalization of all of mathematics inaxiomatic form, together with a proof that this axiomatization ofmathematics is consistent. The consistency proof itself was to becarried out using only what Hilbert called ``finitary''methods. The special epistemological character of finitary reasoningthen yields the required justification of classicalmathematics. Although Hilbert proposed his program in this form onlyin 1921, various facets of it are rooted in foundational work of hisgoing back until around 1900, when he first pointed out the necessityof giving a direct consistency proof of analysis. Work on the programprogressed significantly in the 1920s with contributions fromlogicians such as Paul Bernays, Wilhelm Ackermann, John von Neumann,and Jacques Herbrand. It was also a great influenceon Kurt G\"odel, whose work on theincompleteness theorems were motivated by Hilbert's Program.G\"odel's work is generally taken to show that Hilbert's Programcannot be carried out. It has nevertheless continued to be aninfluential position in the philosophy of mathematics, and, startingwith the work of Gerhard Gentzen in the 1930s, work on so-calledRelativized Hilbert Programs have been central to thedevelopment of proof theory.},

With time, researchers have a more complete understanding of the molecular-biological defects that underlie CF. This knowledge is leading to alternative approaches regarding the treatment of this condition. Trikafta is the third FDA-approved drug that targets the F508del mutation of the CFTR gene. The drug is a combination of three individual drugs which are elexacaftor (ELX), tezacaftor (TEZ), and ivacaftor (IVA). This trio increases the activity of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein and reduces the mortality and morbidity rates in CF patients. The effectiveness of Trikafta, seen in clinical trials, outperforms currently available therapies in terms of lung function, quality of life, sweat chloride reduction, and pulmonary exacerbation reduction. The safety and efficacy of CFTR modulators in children with CF have also been studied. Continued evaluation of patient data is needed to confirm its long-term safety and efficacy. In this study, we will focus on reviewing data from clinical trials regarding the benefits of CFTR modulator therapy. We address the impact of Trikafta on lung function, pulmonary exacerbations, and quality of life. Adverse events of the different CFTR modulators are discussed.},

Ab initio molecular dynamics simulations of reline, a mixture consisting of urea and choline chloride, reveal that not solely hydrogen bonds allow similar interactions between both constituents. The chloride anion and the oxygen atom of urea also show a similar spatial distribution close to the cationic core of choline due to a similar charge located on both atoms. As a result of multiple similar interactions, clusters migrating together cannot be observed in reline which supports the hypothesis similia similibus solvuntur. In contrast to previous suggestions, the interaction of the hydroxyl group of choline with a hydrogen bond acceptor is overall rigid. Fast hydrogen bond acceptor dynamics is facilitated by the hydrogen atoms in the trans position to the carbonyl group of urea which contributes to the low melting point of reline.}

Polarized epithelial cells have morphologically and functionally distinct apical and basolateral surfaces separated by tight junctions.

In this work, we have isolated a cDNA clone from a human intestinal cDNA library encoding a small GTPase, rab13, closely related to the yeast Sec4 protein. Confocal microscopy analysis on polarized Caco-2 cells shows that rab13 protein colocalized with the tight junction marker ZO-1. Cryostat sections of tissues confirm that rab13 localized to the junctional complex region of a variety of epithelia, including intestine, kidney, liver, and of endothelial cells. This localization requires assembly and integrity of the tight junctions. Disruption of tight junctions by incubation in low Ca2+ media induces the redistribution of rab13. In cells devoid of tight junctions, rab13 was found associated with vesicles dispersed throughout the cytoplasm. Cell-cell contacts initiated by E-cadherin in transfected L cells do not recruit rab13 to the resulting adherens-like junction complexes. The participation of rab13 in polarized transport, in the assembly and/or the activity of tight junctions is discussed.},

We investigated membrane proteins solved in nanodiscs, amphipols or detergents to analyze whether the nature of the amphipathic compound influences the belt size in 3D reconstructions.

We showed that all the belts create on average similar reconstructions, whether they originate from the same protein, or from protein from different shapes and structures.

In this work, we have demonstrated that this stabilizing effect is manifested through a dramatic (five- to sixfold) decrease in the unfolding rate of the domain with the folding rate being affected minimally. This behavior contrasts to the effect of NaCl, which stabilizes this domain by accelerating the folding rate. These data imply that the stabilizing effect of GuHCl is not predominantly ionic in nature. Through NMR studies, we have identified a specific binding site for guanidinium, and we have determined a dissociation constant of 90 mM for this interaction. The guanidinium-binding site overlaps with a functionally important arginine-binding pocket on the domain surface, and we have shown that GuHCl is a specific inhibitor of the peptide-binding activity of the domain. A different SH3 domain possessing a similar arginine-binding pocket is also thermodynamically stabilized by GuHCl. These data suggest that many proteins that normally interact with arginine-containing ligands may also be able to specifically interact with guanidinium. Thus, some caution should be used when using GuHCl as a denaturant in protein folding studies. Since arginine-mediated interactions are often important in the energetics of protein-protein interactions, our observations could be relevant for the design of small molecule inhibitors of protein-protein interactions.

We tested the suitability of this method with a mouse model of experimental asthma. In response to allergen challenge, perturbations in the sphingolipids were detected, which led to increased levels of ceramides. We expanded the scope of this approach analysing human bronchus samples without pathological findings of adenocarcinoma patients. For the human lung epithelium an unusual lipid class distribution was found in which ceramide was the predominant sphingolipid. In summary, we show that disease progression and lipid metabolism perturbation can be monitored in animal models and that the method can be used for the analysis of clinical samples.},

Despite having been activated through phosphorylation and provided with ATP ligands, several near-atomistic cryo-EM structures of CFTR are in a closed state, as inferred from the lack of a continuous passage through a hydrophobic bottleneck region located in the extracellular portion of the pore. Here, we present repeated, microsecond-long molecular dynamics simulations of human CFTR solvated in a lipid bilayer and aqueous NaCl. At equilibrium, Cl  -  ions enter the channel through a lateral intracellular portal and bind to two distinct cationic sites inside the channel pore but do not traverse the narrow, de-wetted bottleneck. Simulations conducted in the presence of a strong hyperpolarizing electric field led to spontaneous chloride translocation events through the bottleneck region of the channel, suggesting that the protein relaxed to a functionally open state. Conformational changes of small magnitude involving transmembrane helices 1 and 6 preceded ion permeation through diverging exit routes at the extracellular end of the pore. Although permeating Cl  -  ions remain mostly hydrated, partial dehydration occurs at the binding sites and in the bottleneck. This portion of the pore undergoes wetting prior to Cl  -  translocation, suggesting that it acts as a hydrophobic gate. The observed Cl  -  pathway is largely consistent with the loci of mutations that alter channel conductance, anion binding, and ion selectivity, supporting the model of the open state of CFTR obtained in the present study.},

Plato is deeply impressedwith the order and beauty he observes in the universe, and his projectin the dialogue is to explain that order and beauty. The universe, heproposes, is the product of rational, purposive, and beneficent agency.It is the handiwork of a divine Craftsman (``Demiurge,''d\^emiourgos, 28a6), who, imitating an unchanging andeternal model, imposes mathematical order on a preexistent chaos togenerate the ordered universe (kosmos). The governingexplanatory principle of the account is teleological: the universe as awhole as well as its various parts are so arranged as to produce a vastarray of good effects. It strikes Plato strongly that this arrangementis not fortuitous, but the outcome of the deliberate intent ofIntellect (nous), anthropomorphically represented by thefigure of the Craftsman who plans and constructs a world that is asexcellent as its nature permits it to be., As Plato tells it, the beautiful orderliness of the universe is notonly the manifestation of Intellect; it is also the model for rationalsouls to understand and to emulate. Such understanding and emulationrestores those souls to their original state of excellence, a statethat was lost in their embodiment. There is, then, an explicit ethicaland religious dimension to the discourse., This picture of a divinely created universe, though controversialfrom the start (see below, section 2), has captured the imagination and admiration of numerous generationsof philosophers and theologians though the centuries.[1] Because of the vast scope of the work, as well as its character as amonologue\textemdash by excluding exchanges between interlocutors thediscourse is much more like an authoritative statement than a set ofquestions to be investigated\textemdash the Timaeus was generallytaken to be the culmination of its author's intellectualachievement, particularly by thinkers in sympathy with its portrayalof the universe. Not surprisingly, as after the Renaissance thetheological worldview gave way to a more secular one, the culturalinfluence of the Timaeus began to wane over time. In thelatter part of the nineteenth and earlier part of the twentiethcentury interest in the Timaeus was again stimulated by therefinement of philological methods and exact historical scholarship,[2] but for most of the second half of the twentieth century the dialoguewas frequently dismissed as philosophically insignificant at best andregressive at worst. It played an important role in debates about thedevelopment of Plato's philosophy, but not much more. Recentdecades, however, have witnessed a revival of interest in theTimaeus: philosophers, historians of science and of ideas,and philologists, while not persuaded by the dialogue's boldclaims, have been fascinated by its majestic account and havesympathetically entered into and sought to elucidate its conceptualstructure.},

Within an open burst, it was possible to distinguish three distinct conductance states referred to as the full conductance, subconductance 1, and subconductance 2 states. Amino acid substitutions in transmembrane segment 6 altered the duration and probability of occurrence of these subconductance states but did not greatly alter their relative amplitudes. Results from real time measurements indicated that covalent modification of single R334C-CFTR channels by [2-(trimethylammonium)ethyl]methanethiosulfonate resulted in the simultaneous modification of all three conductance levels in what appeared to be a single step, without changing the proportion of time spent in each state. This behavior suggests that at least a portion of the conduction path is common to all three conducting states. The time course for the modification of R334C-CFTR, measured in outside-out macropatches using a rapid perfusion system, was also consistent with a single modification step as if each pore contained only a single copy of the cysteine at position 334. These results are consistent with a model for the CFTR conduction pathway in which a single anion-conducting pore is formed by a single CFTR polypeptide.}

  abstract = {Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) chloride channels are gated by binding and hydrolysis of ATP at the nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs). We used covalent modification of CFTR channels bearing a cysteine engineered at position 334 to investigate changes in pore conformation that might accompany channel gating. In single R334C-CFTR channels studied in excised patches, modification by [2-(trimethylammonium)ethyl] methanethiosulfonate (MTSET+), which increases conductance, occurred only during channel closed states. This suggests that the rate of reaction of the cysteine was greater in closed channels than in open channels. R334C-CFTR channels in outside-out macropatches activated by ATP alone were modified with first order kinetics upon rapid exposure to MTSET+. Modification was much slower when channels were locked open by the addition of nonhydrolyzable nucleotide or when the R334C mutation was coupled to a second mutation, K1250A, which greatly decreases channel closing rate. In contrast, modification was faster in R334C/K464A-CFTR channels, which exhibit prolonged interburst closed states. These data indicate that the reactivity of the engineered cysteine in R334C-CFTR is state-dependent, providing evidence of changes in pore conformation coupled to ATP binding and hydrolysis at the NBDs. The data also show that maneuvers that lock open R334C-CFTR do so by locking channels into the prominent s2 subconductance state, suggesting that the most stable conducting state of the pore reflects the fully occupied, prehydrolytic state of the NBDs. \textcopyright{} 2005 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.}

As an anode for lithium ion batteries, cyclic voltammetry curves, electrochemical impedance spectra, and cyclability of the novel structured Ni-P nanoparticles were evaluated. It was found that the sample with a thicker crystalline shell exhibited improved capability and reversibility over the sample with a thinner one, especially at a higher discharge-charge current density.

In this study, we employed substituted cysteine accessibility methodology (SCAM) to screen the entire TM5 defined by the original topology model and its cytoplasmic extension in a Cysless background. We found six positions (A299, R303, N306, S307, F310, and F311) where engineered cysteines react to intracellular 2-sulfonatoethyl methanethiosulfonate (MTSES-). Quantification of the modification rate of engineered cysteines in the presence or absence of ATP suggests that these six residues are accessible in both the open and closed states. Whole-cell experiments with external MTSES- identified only two positive positions (L323 and A326), resulting in a segment containing 11 consecutive amino acids, where substituted cysteines respond to neither internal nor external MTSES-, a unique feature not seen previously in CFTR's pore-lining segments. The observation that these positions are inaccessible to channel-permeant thiol-specific reagent [Au(CN)2]2' suggests that this segment of TM5 between F311 and L323 is concealed from the pore by other TMs and/or lipid bilayers. In addition, our data support the idea that the positively charged arginine at position 303 poses a pure electrostatic action in determining the single-channel current amplitude of CFTR and the effect of an open-channel blocker glibencalmide. Collectively, we conclude that the cytoplasmic portion of CFTR's TM5 lines the pore. Our functional data are remarkably consistent with predicted structural arrangements of TM5 in some homology models of CFTR.}

  abstract = {Dramatic functional changes of enzyme usually require scores of alterations in amino acid sequence. However, in the case of guanylate kinase (GK), the functional novelty is induced by a single (S\textrightarrow P) mutation, leading to the functional transition of the enzyme from a phosphoryl transfer kinase into a phosphorprotein interaction domain. Here, by using molecular dynamic (MD) and metadynamics simulations, we provide a comprehensive description of the conformational transitions of the enzyme after mutating serine to proline. Our results suggest that the serine plays a crucial role in maintaining the closed conformation of wild-type GK and the GMP recognition. On the contrary, the S\textrightarrow P mutant exhibits a stable open conformation and loses the ability of ligand binding, which explains its functional transition from the GK enzyme to the GK domain. Furthermore, the free energy profiles (FEPs) obtained by metadymanics clearly demonstrate that the open-closed conformational transition in WT GK is positive correlated with the process of GMP binding, indicating the GMP-induced closing motion of GK enzyme, which is not observed in the mutant. In addition, the FEPs show that the S\textrightarrow P mutation can also leads to the mis-recognition of GMP, explaining the vanishing of catalytic activity of the mutant.},

In CFTR, we observe a large anion conduction pathway lined by numerous positively charged residues. A single gate near the extracellular surface closes the channel. The regulatory domain, dephosphorylated, is located in the intracellular opening between the two nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs), preventing NBD dimerization and channel opening. The structure also reveals why many cystic-fibrosis-causing mutations would lead to defects either in folding, ion conduction, or gating and suggests new avenues for therapeutic intervention.},

  abstract = {Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is an ion channel that couples adenosine triphosphate (ATP) hydrolysis at its nucleotide-binding domains to gating transitions in its transmembrane domains. We previously reported that the charge-neutralized mutant R352C shows two distinct open states, O1 and O2 The two states could be distinguished by their single-channel current amplitudes: O1 having a smaller amplitude (representing a prehydrolytic open state) and O2 having a larger amplitude (representing a post-hydrolytic open state). In this study, a similar phenotype is described for two mutations of another pore-lining residue, N306D and N306E, suggesting that alterations of the net charge within CFTR's pore confer this unique conductance aberration. Because moving either of the two endogenous charges, R303 and R352, to positions further along TM5 and TM6, respectively, also results in this O1O2 phenotype, we conclude that the position of the charged residue in the internal vestibule affects hydrolysis-dependent conductance changes. Furthermore, our data show that the buffer and CFTR blocker morpholino propane sulfonic acid (MOPS-) occludes the O1 state more than it does the O2 state when the net charge of the internal vestibule is unchanged or increased. In contrast, when the net charge in the internal vestibule is decreased, the differential sensitivity to MOPS- block is diminished. We propose a three-state blocking mechanism to explain the charge-dependent sensitivity of prehydrolytic and post-hydrolytic open states to MOPS- block. We further posit that the internal vestibule expands during the O1 to O2 transition so that mutation-induced electrostatic perturbations within the pore are amplified by the smaller internal vestibule of the O1 state and thus result in the O1O2 phenotype and the charge-dependent sensitivity of the two open states to MOPS- block. Our study not only relates the O1O2 phenotype to the charge distribution in CFTR's internal vestibule but also provides a toolbox for mechanistic studies of CFTR gating by ATP hydrolysis.},

The phosphorylated regulatory domain is disengaged from its inhibitory position; the nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs) form a ``head-to-tail'' dimer upon binding ATP; and the cytoplasmic pathway, found closed off in other ATP-binding cassette transporters, is cracked open, consistent with CFTR's unique channel function. Unexpectedly, the extracellular mouth of the ion pore remains closed, indicating that local movements of the transmembrane helices can control ion access to the pore even in the NBD-dimerized conformation.},

In particular, to achieve deep desulfurization, the conventional hydrodesulfurization (HDS) process has shown limitations in the removal of aromatic sulfur compounds. Recently, extractive desulfurization using a new type of nonvolatile solvent, ionic liquids (ILs), has yielded promising results. However, there is a lack of systematic evaluation of the effect of IL structure on desulfurization efficiency, and a lack of mechanistic understanding regarding how ILs lead to the partition of aromatic sulfur compounds from fuel to the IL phase. The present study examines a total of 71 ILs and two deep eutectic solvents (DESs) with combinations representing various cations and anions. We identify a number of ILs that yield high partition coefficients [up to 1.85 mg(S) kg (IL)-1/mg(S) kg (oil)-1] for the partition of aromatic sulfur compounds between ILs and n-octane or n-dodecane as surrogates for gasoline or diesel, respectively. We find that the high sulfur partition coefficient correlates with a high dipolarity/polarizability ({$\pi{_\ast}$}) or a low solvent polarizability (SP) of ILs carrying the same cation and different anions, but correlates with a low dipolarity/polarizability ({$\pi{_\ast}$}) for ILs carrying the same anion paired to cations bearing different alkyl chain lengths. We further demonstrate that a four-step extraction using ILs can achieve 99\% dibenzothiophene (DBT) removal (i.e., an initial sulfur content of 500 ppm is reduced to {$<$}5 ppm following extraction).},

We explored the CFTR pore by studying voltage-dependent blockade of the channel by two organic anions: glibenclamide and isethionate. To simplify the kinetic analysis, a CFTR mutant, K1250A-CFTR, was used because this mutant channel, once opened, can remain open for minutes. Dose-response relationships of both blockers follow a simple Michaelis-Menten function with Kd values that differ by three orders of magnitude. Glibenclamide blocks CFTR from the intracellular side of the membrane with slow kinetics. Both the on and off rates of glibenclamide block are voltage dependent. Removing external Cl- increases affinity of glibenclamide due to a decrease of the off rate and an increase of the on rate, suggesting the presence of a Cl- binding site external to the glibenclamide binding site. Isethionate blocks the channel from the cytoplasmic side with fast kinetics, but has no measurable effect when applied extracellularly. Increasing the internal Cl- concentration reduces isethionate block without affecting its voltage dependence, suggesting that Cl- and isethionate compete for a binding site in the pore. The voltage dependence and external Cl- concentration dependence of isethionate block are nearly identical to those of glibenclamide block, suggesting that these two blockers may bind to a common binding site, an idea further supported by kinetic studies of blocking with glibenclamide/isethionate mixtures. By comparing the physical and chemical natures of these two blockers, we propose that CFTR channel has an asymmetric pore with a wide internal entrance and a deeply embedded blocker binding site where local charges as well as hydrophobic components determine the affinity of the blockers.},

The elastic area compressibility modulus was unaffected between pH 3 and 9 but was reduced by {$\sim$}30\% at pH 2.

  abstract = {Template-based protein structure modeling is commonly used for protein structure prediction. Based on the observation that multiple template-based methods often perform better than single template-based methods, we further explore the use of a variable number of multiple templates for a given target in the latest variant of TASSER, TASSER(VMT) . We first develop an algorithm that improves the target-template alignment for a given template. The improved alignment, called the SP(3) alternative alignment, is generated by a parametric alignment method coupled with short TASSER refinement on models selected using knowledge-based scores. The refined top model is then structurally aligned to the template to produce the SP(3) alternative alignment. Templates identified using SP(3) threading are combined with the SP(3) alternative and HHEARCH alignments to provide target alignments to each template. These template models are then grouped into sets containing a variable number of template/alignment combinations. For each set, we run short TASSER simulations to build full-length models. Then, the models from all sets of templates are pooled, and the top 20-50 models selected using FTCOM ranking method. These models are then subjected to a single longer TASSER refinement run for final prediction. We benchmarked our method by comparison with our previously developed approach, pro-sp(3) -TASSER, on a set with 874 easy and 318 hard targets. The average GDT-TS score improvements for the first model are 3.5 and 4.3\% for easy and hard targets, respectively. When tested on the 112 CASP9 targets, our method improves the average GDT-TS scores as compared to pro-sp3-TASSER by 8.2 and 9.3\% for the 80 easy and 32 hard targets, respectively. It also shows slightly better results than the top ranked CASP9 Zhang-Server, QUARK and HHpredA methods. The program is available for download at http://cssb.biology.gatech.edu/.},

  abstract = {Synaptotagmin-1 and neuronal SNARE proteins have central roles in evoked synchronous neurotransmitter release; however, it is unknown how they cooperate to trigger synaptic vesicle fusion. Here we report atomic-resolution crystal structures of Ca2+ - and Mg2+ -bound complexes between synaptotagmin-1 and the neuronal SNARE complex, one of which was determined with diffraction data from an X-ray free-electron laser, leading to an atomic-resolution structure with accurate rotamer assignments for many side chains. The structures reveal several interfaces, including a large, specific, Ca2+ -independent and conserved interface. Tests of this interface by mutagenesis suggest that it is essential for Ca2+ -triggered neurotransmitter release in mouse hippocampal neuronal synapses and for Ca2+ -triggered vesicle fusion in a reconstituted system. We propose that this interface forms before Ca2+ triggering, moves en bloc as Ca2+ influx promotes the interactions between synaptotagmin-1 and the plasma membrane, and consequently remodels the membrane to promote fusion, possibly in conjunction with other interfaces.},

  abstract = {The weighted histogram analysis method (WHAM) has become the standard technique for the analysis of umbrella sampling simulations. In this article, we address the challenges (1) of obtaining fast and accurate solutions of the coupled nonlinear WHAM equations, (2) of quantifying the statistical errors of the resulting free energies, (3) of diagnosing possible systematic errors, and (4) of optimally allocating of the computational resources. Traditionally, the WHAM equations are solved by a fixed-point direct iteration method, despite poor convergence and possible numerical inaccuracies in the solutions. Here, we instead solve the mathematically equivalent problem of maximizing a target likelihood function, by using superlinear numerical optimization algorithms with a significantly faster convergence rate. To estimate the statistical errors in one-dimensional free energy profiles obtained from WHAM, we note that for densely spaced umbrella windows with harmonic biasing potentials, the WHAM free energy profile can be approximated by a coarse-grained free energy obtained by integrating the mean restraining forces. The statistical errors of the coarse-grained free energies can be estimated straightforwardly and then used for the WHAM results. A generalization to multidimensional WHAM is described. We also propose two simple statistical criteria to test the consistency between the histograms of adjacent umbrella windows, which help identify inadequate sampling and hysteresis in the degrees of freedom orthogonal to the reaction coordinate. Together, the estimates of the statistical errors and the diagnostics of inconsistencies in the potentials of mean force provide a basis for the efficient allocation of computational resources in free energy simulations.},

  abstract = {GLIC is a bacterial member of the large family of pentameric ligand-gated ion channels. To study ion conduction through GLIC and other membrane channels, we combine the one-dimensional potential of mean force for ion passage with a Smoluchowski diffusion model, making it possible to calculate single-channel conductance in the regime of low ion concentrations from all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. We then perform MD simulations to examine sodium ion conduction through the GLIC transmembrane pore in two systems with different bulk ion concentrations. The ion potentials of mean force, calculated from umbrella sampling simulations with Hamiltonian replica exchange, reveal a major barrier at the hydrophobic constriction of the pore. The relevance of this barrier for ion transport is confirmed by a committor function that rises sharply in the barrier region. From the free evolution of Na(+) ions starting at the barrier top, we estimate the effective diffusion coefficient in the barrier region, and subsequently calculate the conductance of the pore. The resulting diffusivity compares well with the position-dependent ion diffusion coefficient obtained from restrained simulations. The ion conductance obtained from the diffusion model agrees with the value determined via a reactive-flux rate calculation. Our results show that the conformation in the GLIC crystal structure, with an estimated conductance of \textasciitilde 1 picosiemens at 140 mM ion concentration, is consistent with a physiologically open state of the channel.},

  abstract = {Accurate force field parameters for proteins and drugs are of fundamental importance for predicting protein-drug binding poses and binding free energies in structure-based drug design. Osmotic pressure simulations have recently gained popularity as a means to validate common force fields for biomolecules such as proteins; up to now, however, little such effort has been made to use these methods to validate common force fields for small drug-like molecules. In this work, osmotic coefficients of 16 drug-like molecules were calculated from osmotic pressure molecular dynamics simulations using four common force fields for drug-like molecules: GAFF, CGenFF, OPLS-AA, and PRODRGFF. While GAFF, CGenFF, and OPLS-AA produced osmotic coefficients that are in good agreement with the corresponding experimental osmotic coefficients, PRODRGFF, which attempts to use GROMOS parameters, often produced osmotic coefficients that are in poor agreement. All four force fields poorly reproduced the experimental osmotic coefficients of purine-derived molecules including purine, 6-methylpurine, and caffeine, suggesting common issues in describing interactions of this particular molecule type. The poor overall performance of PRODRGFF can be mainly attributed to the poor results with two macrocyclic molecules HMT and TAT, which can be significantly improved by reparameterizing the van der Waals (vdW) parameters of alkyl carbons and using lower solute concentration. In addition, the recently developed GAFF2 with revamped vdW parameters was found to produce osmotic coefficients that are in slightly better agreement with experiments than GAFF. Overall, the four common force fields for drug-like molecules tested in this study performed reasonably well at reproducing experimental osmotic coefficients of drug-like molecules, although failures of certain force fields on certain molecules suggest that further force field reparameterizations, especially for vdW parameters, might be required to improve their accuracy.},

  abstract = {Cystic fibrosis (CF) is caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator gene (CFTR). In light of the strong allelic heterogeneity and regional specificity of the mutation spectrum, the strategy of molecular diagnostics and counseling in CF requires genetic tests to reflect the frequency profile characteristic for a given population. The goal of the study was to provide an updated comprehensive estimation of the distribution of CFTR mutations in Polish CF patients and to assess the effectiveness of INNOLiPA\_CFTR tests in Polish population. The analyzed cohort consisted of 738 patients with the clinically confirmed CF diagnosis, prescreened for molecular defects using INNOLiPA\_CFTR panels from Innogenetics. A combined efficiency of INNOLiPA CFTR\_19 and CFTR\_17\_TnUpdate tests was 75.5\%; both mutations were detected in 68.2\%, and one mutation in 14.8\% of the affected individuals. The group composed of all the patients with only one or with no mutation detected (109 and 126 individuals, respectively) was analyzed further using a mutation screening approach, i.e. SSCP/HD (single strand conformational polymorphism/heteroduplex) analysis of PCR products followed by sequencing of the coding sequence. As a result, 53 more mutations were found in 97 patients. The overall efficiency of the CF allele detection was 82.5\% (7.0\% increase compared to INNOLiPA tests alone). The distribution of the most frequent mutations in Poland was assessed. Most of the mutations repetitively found in Polish patients had been previously described in other European populations. The most frequent mutated allele, F508del, represented 54.5\% of Polish CF chromosomes. Another eight mutations had frequencies over 1\%, 24 had frequencies between 1 and 0.1\%; c.2052-2053insA and c.3468+2\_3468+3insT were the most frequent non-INNOLiPA mutations. Mutation distribution described herein is also relevant to the Polish diaspora. Our study also demonstrates that the reported efficiency of mutation detection strongly depends on the diagnostic experience of referring health centers.},

Structure data suggest that signals are transduced through intracellular loops of the TMDs that slot into grooves on the NBDs. At the base of these grooves is the Q loop. We therefore mutated the eponymous glutamine in one or both NBD Q loops and measured the effect on conformation and function by using a conformation-sensitive antibody (UIC2) and a fluorescent drug (Bodipy-verapamil), respectively. We showed that the double mutant is trapped in the inward-open state, which binds the drug, but cannot couple to the ATPase cycle. Our data also describe marked redundancy within the transport mechanism, because single-Q-loop mutants are functional for Bodipy-verapamil transport. This result allowed us to elucidate transduction pathways from twin drug-binding cavities to the Q loops using point mutations to favor one cavity over the other. Together, the data show that the Q loop is the central flexion point where the aspect of the drug-binding cavities is coupled to the ATP catalytic cycle.},

Results: Rectal organoid-derived monolayers were generated within four days. Ion transport measurements of CFTR function using these monolayers correlated with ICM and organoid swelling (r = 0.73 and 0.79 respectively). Culturing the monolayers under differentiation conditions enhanced the detection of mucus-secreting cells and was accompanied by reduced CFTR function. Conclusions: CFTR-dependent intestinal epithelial ion transport properties can be measured in rectal organoid-derived monolayers of subjects and correlate with donor-matched ICM and rectal organoid swelling.},

  abstract = {The weighted ensemble (WE) path sampling approach orchestrates an ensemble of parallel calculations with intermittent communication to enhance the sampling of rare events, such as molecular associations or conformational changes in proteins or peptides. Trajectories are replicated and pruned in a way that focuses computational effort on underexplored regions of configuration space while maintaining rigorous kinetics. To enable the simulation of rare events at any scale (e.g., atomistic, cellular), we have developed an open-source, interoperable, and highly scalable software package for the execution and analysis of WE simulations: WESTPA (The Weighted Ensemble Simulation Toolkit with Parallelization and Analysis). WESTPA scales to thousands of CPU cores and includes a suite of analysis tools that have been implemented in a massively parallel fashion. The software has been designed to interface conveniently with any dynamics engine and has already been used with a variety of molecular dynamics (e.g., GROMACS, NAMD, OpenMM, AMBER) and cell-modeling packages (e.g., BioNetGen, MCell). WESTPA has been in production use for over a year, and its utility has been demonstrated for a broad set of problems, ranging from atomically detailed host-guest associations to nonspatial chemical kinetics of cellular signaling networks. The following describes the design and features of WESTPA, including the facilities it provides for running WE simulations and storing and analyzing WE simulation data, as well as examples of input and output.}
