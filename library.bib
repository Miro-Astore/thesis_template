abstract = {The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is an anion channel evolved from the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter family. In this study, we determined the structure of zebrafish CFTR in the absence of ATP by electron cryo-microscopy to 3.7 {\AA} resolution. Human and zebrafish CFTR share 55{\%} sequence identity, and 42 of the 46 cystic-fibrosis-causing missense mutational sites are identical. In CFTR, we observe a large anion conduction pathway lined by numerous positively charged residues. A single gate near the extracellular surface closes the channel. The regulatory domain, dephosphorylated, is located in the intracellular opening between the two nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs), preventing NBD dimerization and channel opening. The structure also reveals why many cystic-fibrosis-causing mutations would lead to defects either in folding, ion conduction, or gating and suggests new avenues for therapeutic intervention.},

abstract = {Sampling a molecular process characterized by an activation free energy significantly larger than kBT is a well-known challenge in molecular dynamics simulations. In a recent work [Tiwary and Parrinello, Phys. Rev. Lett. 2013, 111, 230602], we have demonstrated that the transition times of activated molecular transformations can be computed from well-tempered metadynamics provided that no bias is deposited in the transition state region and that the set of collective variables chosen to enhance sampling does not display hysteresis. Ensuring though that these two criteria are met may not always be simple. Here we build on the fact that the times of escape from a long-lived metastable state obey Poisson statistics. This allows us to identify quantitative measures of trustworthiness of our calculation. We test our method on a few paradigmatic examples. {\textcopyright} 2014 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {Protein misfolding refers to a process where proteins become structurally abnormal and lose their specific 3-dimensional spatial configuration. The histopathological presence of misfolded protein (MP) aggregates has been associated as the primary evidence of multiple neurological diseases, including Prion diseases, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease. However, the exact mechanisms of MP aggregation and propagation, as well as their impact in the long-term patient's clinical condition are still not well understood. With this aim, a variety of mathematical models has been proposed for a better insight into the kinetic rate laws that govern the microscopic processes of protein aggregation. Complementary, another class of large-scale models rely on modern molecular imaging techniques for describing the phenomenological effects of MP propagation over the whole brain. Unfortunately, those neuroimaging-based studies do not take full advantage of the tremendous capabilities offered by the chemical kinetics modeling approach. Actually, it has been barely acknowledged that the vast majority of large-scale models have foundations on previous mathematical approaches that describe the chemical kinetics of protein replication and propagation. The purpose of the current manuscript is to present a historical review about the development of mathematical models for describing both microscopic processes that occur during the MP aggregation and large-scale events that characterize the progression of neurodegenerative MP-mediated diseases.},

abstract = {Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disorder that causes multiorgan morbidity and premature death, most commonly from pulmonary dysfunction. Mutations in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene, of which almost 2000 have been described, result in a dysfunctional CFTR protein. This protein is an adenosine triphosphate binding anion channel, present primarily at the surface of epithelial cells. Loss of function mutations in this anion channel result in decreased or absent chloride/bicarbonate transport. The subsequent abnormal salt and water transport at epithelial cell surfaces leads to thickened secretions, and infection or inflammation in affected organs. In the last 20 years, therapeutics have been developed to treat the signs and symptoms of CF. However, in 2012, the small molecule drug, ivacaftor, became the first approved therapy that addresses the basic defect in CF. Ivacaftor is a potentiator of CFTR channels defective in their chloride/bicarbonate gating/conductance, but present at the epithelial cell surface. It is only approved for 10 mutations carried by approximately 7{\%} of the population of patients with CF. F508del is the most common CFTR mutation, present in homozygosity in approximately 50{\%} of patients with CF. The F508del mutation results in multiple CFTR channel defects that require both correction (stabilization of misfolded CFTR and trafficking to the epithelial cell membrane) and potentiation. This article reviews the in vitro and clinical trial data for the potential use of the potentiator, ivacaftor, and the corrector, lumacaftor, in patients with CF. {\textcopyright} 2015, SAGE Publications.

abstract = {Classical scoring functions have reached a plateau in their performance in virtual screening and binding affinity prediction. Recently, machine-learning scoring functions trained on protein-ligand complexes have shown great promise in small tailored studies. They have also raised controversy, specifically concerning model overfitting and applicability to novel targets. Here we provide a new ready-to-use scoring function (RF-Score-VS) trained on 15 426 active and 893 897 inactive molecules docked to a set of 102 targets. We use the full DUD-E data sets along with three docking tools, five classical and three machine-learning scoring functions for model building and performance assessment. Our results show RF-Score-VS can substantially improve virtual screening performance: RF-Score-VS top 1{\%} provides 55.6{\%} hit rate, whereas that of Vina only 16.2{\%} (for smaller percent the difference is even more encouraging: RF-Score-VS top 0.1{\%} achieves 88.6{\%} hit rate for 27.5{\%} using Vina). In addition, RFScore- VS provides much better prediction of measured binding affinity than Vina (Pearson correlation of 0.56 and -0.18, respectively). Lastly, we test RF-Score-VS on an independent test set from the DEKOIS benchmark and observed comparable results. We provide full data sets to facilitate further research in this area (http://github.com/oddt/rfscorevs) as well as ready-to-use RF-Score-VS (http://github.com/oddt/rfscorevs-binary).},

abstract = {Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is an inherited disease caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) ion channel. Mutations in CFTR cause impaired chloride ion transport in the epithelial tissues of patients leading to cardiopulmonary decline and pancreatic insufficiency in the most severely affected patients. CFTR is composed of twelve membrane-spanning domains, two nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs), and a regulatory domain. The most common mutation in CFTR is a deletion of phenylalanine at position 508 ($\delta$F508) in NBD1. Previous research has primarily concentrated on the structure and dynamics of the NBD1 domain; However numerous pathological mutations have also been found in the lesser-studied NBD2 domain. We have investigated the amino acid coevolved network of interactions in NBD2, and the changes that occur in that network upon the introduction of CF and CF-related mutations (S1251N(T), S1235R, D1270N, N1303K (T)). Extensive coupling between the $\alpha$- and $\beta$-subdomains were identified with residues in, or near Walker A, Walker B, H-loop and C-loop motifs. Alterations in the predicted residue network varied from moderate for the S1251T perturbation to more severe for N1303T. The S1235R and D1270N networks varied greatly compared to the wildtype, but these CF mutations only affect ion transport preference and do not severely disrupt CFTR function, suggesting dynamic flexibility in the network of interactions in NBD2. Our results also suggest that inappropriate interactions between the $\beta$-subdomain and Q-loop could be detrimental. We also identified mutations predicted to stabilize the NBD2 residue network upon introduction of the CF and CF-related mutations, and these predicted mutations are scored as benign by the MUTPRED2 algorithm. Our results suggest the level of disruption of the coevolution predictions of the amino acid networks in NBD2 does not have a straightforward correlation with the severity of the CF phenotypes observed.},

abstract = {In this study, we examined the folding processes of eight helical proteins (2I9M, TC5B, 1WN8, 1V4Z, 1HO2, 1HLL, 2KFE, and 1YYB) at room temperature using the explicit solvent model under the AMBER14SB force field with the accelerated molecular dynamics (AMD) and traditional molecular dynamics (MD), respectively. We analyzed and compared the simulation results obtained by these two methods based on several aspects, such as root mean square deviation (RMSD), native contacts, cluster analysis, folding snapshots, free energy landscape, and the evolution of the radius of gyration, which showed that these eight proteins were successfully and consistently folded into the corresponding native structures by AMD simulations carried out at room temperature. In addition, the folding occurred in the range of 40{\~{}}180 ns after starting from the linear structures of the eight proteins at 300 K. By contrast, these stable folding structures were not found when the traditional molecular dynamics (MD) simulation was used. At the same time, the influence of high temperatures (350, 400, and 450 K) is also further investigated. Study found that the simulation efficiency of AMD is higher than that of MD simulations, regardless of the temperature. Of these temperatures, 300 K is the most suitable temperature for protein folding for all systems. To further investigate the efficiency of AMD, another trajectory was simulated for eight proteins with the same linear structure but different random seeds at 300 K. Both AMD trajectories reached the correct folded structures. Our result clearly shows that AMD simulation are a highly efficient and reliable method for the study of protein folding.},

abstract = {Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) are progressive neurodegenerative disorders marked in most cases by the nuclear exclusion and cytoplasmic deposition of the RNA binding protein TDP43. We previously demonstrated that ALS-associated mutant TDP43 accumulates within the cytoplasm, and that TDP43 mislocalization predicts neurodegeneration. Here, we sought to prevent neurodegeneration in ALS/FTD models using selective inhibitor of nuclear export (SINE) compounds that target exportin-1 (XPO1). SINE compounds modestly extend cellular survival in neuronal ALS/FTD models and mitigate motor symptoms in an in vivo rat ALS model. At high doses, SINE compounds block nuclear egress of an XPO1 cargo reporter, but not at lower concentrations that were associated with neuroprotection. Neither SINE compounds nor leptomycin B, a separate XPO1 inhibitor, enhanced nuclear TDP43 levels, while depletion of XPO1 or other exportins had little effect on TDP43 localization, suggesting that no single exporter is necessary for TDP43 export. Supporting this hypothesis, we find overexpression of XPO1, XPO7 and NXF1 are each sufficient to promote nuclear TDP43 egress. Taken together, our results indicate that redundant pathways regulate TDP43 nuclear export, and that therapeutic prevention of cytoplasmic TDP43 accumulation in ALS/FTD may be enhanced by targeting several overlapping mechanisms.},

abstract = {To examine the contribution of the large cytoplasmic loops of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) to channel activity, the three point-mutations (S945L, H949Y, G970R) were characterized that have been detected in the third cytoplasmic loop (CL3, residues 933-990) in patients with cystic fibrosis. Chinese hamster ovary cell lines stably expressing wild-type CFTR or mutant G970R-CFTR yielded polypeptides with apparent masses of 170 kDa as the major products, whereas the major products of mutants S945L-CFTR and H949Y-CFTR had apparent masses of 150 kDa. The 150-kDa forms of CFTR were sensitive to endoglycosidase H digestion, indicating that these mutations interfered with maturation of the protein. Increased levels of mature CFTR (170 kDa) could be obtained for mutant H949Y when cells were grown at a lower temperature (26 °C) or incubated in the presence of 10{\%} glycerol. For all mutants, the open probability (P0) of the CFTR channels was significantly altered. S945L-CFTR and G970R-CFTR showed a severe reduction in the P0, whereas the H949Y mutation doubled the P0 relative to wild-type. The changes in P0 predominantly resulted from an alteration of the mean burst durations which suggests that CL3 is involved in obtaining and/or maintaining stability of the open state. In addition, mutants S945L and G970R had current-voltage relationships that were not completely linear over the range ±80 mV, but showed slight outward rectification. The fact that CL3 mutations can have subtle effects on channel conductance indicates that this region may be physically close to the inner mouth of the pore.},

Advanced analytical techniques currently used for characterization of protein aggregates are prone to a number of limitations and usually require additional manipulations with the sample, such as dilution, separation, labeling, and use of special cuvettes. In the present work, we compared conventional techniques for the analysis of protein aggregates with a novel approach that employs the water proton transverse relaxation rate R2(1H2O). We explored differences in the sensitivity of conventional techniques, size-exclusion chromatography (SEC), microflow imaging (MFI), and dynamic light scattering (DLS), and water NMR (wNMR) toward the presence of monoclonal antibody aggregates generated by different stresses. We demonstrate that wNMR outperformed SEC, DLS, and MFI in that it was most consistently sensitive to increases in both soluble and insoluble aggregates, including subvisible particles. The simplicity of wNMR, its sensitivity, and possibility of noninvasive measurements are unique advantages that would permit its application for more efficient and higher throughput optimization of protein formulations.},

abstract = {The two NBDs (nucleotide-binding domains) of ABC (ATP-binding-cassette) proteins function in a complex to mediate ATPase activity and this activity has been linked to their regulated transport activity. A similar model has been proposed for CFTR (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator), the chloride channel defective in cystic fibrosis, wherein ATP binding and hydrolysis regulate the channel gate. Recently, it was shown that the individual NBDs isolated from CFTR primarily mediate adenylate kinase activity, raising the possibility that this activity may also contribute to gating of the CFTR channel. However, this present study shows that whereas the isolated NBDs exhibit adenylate kinase activity, the full-length purified and reconstituted CFTR protein functions as an ATPase, arguing that the enzymatic activity of the NBDs is dependent on their molecular context and appropriate domain-domain assembly. As expected, the disease-causing mutant bearing a mutation in the ABC signature motif, CFTR-G551D, exhibited a markedly reduced ATPase activity. Furthermore, mutation of the putative catalytic base in CFTR caused a reduction in ATPase activity, with the CFTR-E1371Q mutant supporting a low level of residual activity. Neither of these mutants exhibited detectable adenylate kinase activity. Together, these findings support the concept that the molecular mechanism of action of CFTR is dependent on ATP binding and hydrolysis, and that the structure of prokaryotic ABC ATPases provide a useful template for understanding their mechanism of action. {\textcopyright} The Authors.},

abstract = {Emerging knowledge indicates the difficulty in categorizing unusual cystic fibrosis (CF) mutations, with regard to both pathogenic mechanism and theratype. As case in point, we present data concerning P67L mutation of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), a defect carried by a small number of individuals with CF and sometimes attributed to a channel conductance abnormality. Findings from our laboratory and others establish that P67L causes protein misfolding, disrupts maturation, confers gating defects, is thermally stable, and exhibits near normal conductance. These results provide one framework by which rare CF alleles such as P67L can be more comprehensively profiled vis-{\`{a}}-vis molecular pathogenesis. We also demonstrate that emerging CF treatments - ivacaftor and lumacaftor - can mediate pronounced pharmacologic activation of P67L CFTR. Infrequent CF alleles are often improperly characterized, in part, due to the small numbers of patients involved. Moreover, access to new personalized treatments among patients with ultra-orphan genotypes has been limited by difficulty arranging phase III clinical trials, and off-label prescribing has been impaired by high drug cost and difficulty arranging third party reimbursement. Rare CFTR mutations such as P67L are emblematic of the challenges to "precision" medicine, including use of the best available mechanistic knowledge to treat patients with unusual forms of disease.},

abstract = {Deep eutectic solvents, considered ionic liquid (IL) analogues, show promise for many material science and engineering applications over typical ILs because they are readily available and relatively inexpensive. Atomistic molecular dynamics simulations have been performed over a range of temperatures on one eutectic mixture, 1:2 choline chloride/urea, using different force field modifications. Good agreement was achieved between simulated density, volume expansion coefficient, heat capacity, and diffusion coefficients and experimental values in order to validate the best performing force field. Atom-atom and center-of-mass radial distribution functions are discussed in order to understand the atomistic interactions involved in this eutectic mixture. Experimental infrared (IR) spectra are also reported for choline chloride-urea mixtures, and band assignments are discussed. The distribution of hydrogen-bond interactions from molecular simulations is correlated to curve-resolved bands from the IR spectra. This work suggests that there is a strong interaction between the NH2 of urea and the chlorine anion where the system wants to maximize the number of hydrogen bonds to the anion. Additionally, the disappearance of free carbonyl groups upon increasing concentrations of urea suggests that at low urea concentrations, urea will preferentially interact with the anion through the NH2 groups. As this concentration increases, the complex remains but with additional interactions that remove the free carbonyl band from the spectra. The results from both molecular simulations and experimental IR spectroscopy support the idea that key interactions between the moieties in the eutectic mixture interrupt the main interactions within the parent substances and are responsible for the decrease in freezing point. {\textcopyright} 2013 American Chemical Society.},

The simulations reported thus far have been largely aimed at unravelling the relationship between the molecular features within a DES and the depressed melting temperature at its eutectic composition. Computational efforts consistently reveal that the addition of hydrogen bond donors significantly disrupts long-range ordering of the cation–anion arrangement in choline chloride, resulting in significant moderation of the interaction energies between the components of the DES. These studies paint a picture of DES formation being accompanied by hydrogen-bond directed charge transfer processes yielding transient cage-like formation and nanoscale ordering entailing segregation of the ionic and molecular domains. Computational insights further uncover how unique solvation features present within DESs may lead to enhanced biomolecular (e.g., protein, nucleic acid, polysaccharide) stability and/or activity while also offering advantages as environmentally-responsible gas sorbents.},

abstract = {Mutations in the chloride channel cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR) cause cystic fibrosis, a genetic disorder characterized by defects in CFTR biosynthesis, localization to the cell surface, or activation by regulatory factors. It was discovered recently that surface localization of CFTR is stabilized by an interaction between the CFTR N terminus and the multidomain cytoskeletal protein filamin. The details of the CFTR-filamin interaction, however, are unclear. Using x-ray crystallography, we show how the CFTR N terminus binds to immunoglobulin-like repeat 21 of filamin A (FlnA-Ig21). CFTR binds to $\beta$-strands C and D of FlnA-Ig21 using backbone-backbone hydrogen bonds, a linchpin serine residue, and hydrophobic side-chain packing. We use NMR to determine that the CFTR N terminus also binds to several other immunoglobulin-like repeats from filamin A in vitro. Our structural data explain why the cystic fibrosis-causing S13F mutation disrupts CFTR-filamin interaction. We show that FlnA-Ig repeats transfected into cultured Calu-3 cells disrupt CFTR-filamin interaction and reduce surface levels of CFTR. Our findings suggest that filamin A stabilizes surface CFTR by anchoring it to the actin cytoskeleton through interactions with multiple filamin Ig repeats. Such an interaction mode may allow filamins to cluster multiple CFTR molecules and to promote colocalization of CFTR and other filamin-binding proteins in the apical plasma membrane of epithelial cells.},

abstract = {The activities of many DNA-repair proteins are controlled through reversible covalent modification by ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like molecules. Nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) is the predominant DNAdouble-strand break (DSB) repair pathway in mammalian cells and is initiated by DSB ends being recognized by the Ku70/Ku80 (Ku) heterodimer. By using MLN4924, an anti-cancer drug in clinical trials that specifically inhibits conjugation of the ubiquitin-like protein, NEDD8, to target proteins, we demonstrate that NEDD8 accumulation at DNA-damage sites is a highly dynamic process. In addition, we show that depleting cells of the NEDD8 E2-conjugating enzyme, UBE2M, yields ionizing radiation hypersensitivity and reduced cell survival following NHEJ. Finally, we demonstrate that neddylation promotes Ku ubiquitylation after DNA damage and release of Ku and Ku-associated proteins from damage sites following repair. These studies provide insights into how the NHEJ core complex dissociates from repair sites and highlight its importance for cell survival following DSB induction.},

abstract = {Peptide-protein interactions are ubiquitous in living cells and essential to a wide range of biological processes, as well as pathologies such as cancer or cardiovascular disease. Yet, obtaining reliable binding mode predictions in peptide-protein docking remains a great challenge for most computational docking programs. The main goal of this study was to assess the performance of the small molecule docking program rDock in comparison to other widely used small molecule docking programs, using 100 peptide-protein systems with peptides ranging from 2 to 12 residues. As we used two large independent benchmark sets previously published for other small-molecule docking programs (AutoDockVina benchmark and LEADSPEP), the performance of rDock could directly be compared to the performances of AutoDockVina, Surflex, GOLD, and Glide, as well as to the peptide docking protocol PIPER-FlexPepDock and the webserver HPepDock. Our benchmark reveals that rDock can dock the 100 peptides with an overall backbone RMSD below 2.5 {\AA} in 58.5{\%} of the cases (76{\%} for the 47 systems of the AutoDockVina benchmark set and 43{\%} for the 53 systems of the LEADSPEP benchmark set). More specifically, rDock docks up to 11-residue peptides with a backbone RMSD below 2.5 {\AA} in 60.75{\%} of the cases. rDock displays higher accuracy than most available small molecule docking programs for 6–10-residue peptides and can sometimes perform similarly to the peptide docking tool, especially at a high level of exhaustiveness (100 or 150 runs). Its performance, as is the case for many other unguided small molecule docking tools, is compromised when the peptides adopt secondary structures upon binding. However, our analyses suggest that rDock could be used for predicting how medium-sized biologically relevant peptides bind to their respective protein targets when the latter bind in an extended mode.},

abstract = {The absolute performance of any all-atom molecular dynamics simulation is typically limited by the length of the individual timesteps taken when integrating the equations of motion. In the GROMACS simulation software, it has for a long time been possible to use so-called virtual sites to increase the length of the timestep, resulting in a large gain of simulation efficiency. Up until now, support for this approach has in practice been limited to the standard 20 amino acids however, shrinking the applicability domain of virtual sites. MkVsites is a set of python tools which provides a convenient way to obtain all parameters necessary to use virtual sites for virtually any molecules in a simulation. Required as input to MkVsites is the molecular topology of the molecule(s) in question, along with a specification of where to find the parent force field. As such, MkVsites can be a very valuable tool suite for anyone who is routinely using GROMACS for the simulation of molecular systems.},

abstract = {There are more H atoms than any other type of atom in an X-ray crystal structure of a protein-ligand complex, but as H atoms only have one electron they diffract X-rays weakly and are 'hard to see'. The positions of many H atoms can be inferred by our chemical knowledge, and such H atoms can be added with confidence in 'riding positions'. For some chemical groups, however, there is more ambiguity over the possible hydrogen placements, for example hydroxyls and groups that can exist in multiple protonation states or tautomeric forms. This ambiguity is far from rare, since about 25{\%} of drugs have more than one tautomeric form. This paper focuses on the most common, 'prototropic', tautomers, which are isomers that readily interconvert by the exchange of an H atom accompanied by the switch of a single and an adjacent double bond. Hydrogen-exchange rates and different protonation states of compounds (e.g. buffers) are also briefly discussed. The difference in heavy (non-H) atom positions between two tautomers can be small, and careful refinement of all possible tautomers may single out the likely bound ligand tautomer. Experimental methods to determine H-atom positions, such as neutron crystallography, are often technically challenging. Therefore, chemical knowledge and computational approaches are frequently used in conjugation with experimental data to deduce the bound tautomer state. Proton movement is a key feature of many enzymatic reactions, so understanding the orchestration of hydrogen/proton motion is of critical importance to biological chemistry. For example, structural studies have suggested that, just as a chemist may use heat, some enzymes use directional movement to protonate specific O atoms on phosphates to catalyse phosphotransferase reactions. To inhibit 'wriggly' enzymes that use movement to effect catalysis, it may be advantageous to have inhibitors that can maintain favourable contacts by adopting different tautomers as the enzyme 'wriggles'.H atoms are 'hard to see' in X-ray crystal structures of protein-ligand complexes. This paper discusses the problem of identifying the correct tautomeric form(s) of protein-bound ligands.},

To enable the simulation of rare events at any scale (e.g., atomistic, cellular), we have developed an open-source, interoperable, and highly scalable software package for the execution and analysis of WE simulations: WESTPA (The Weighted Ensemble Simulation Toolkit with Parallelization and Analysis). WESTPA scales to thousands of CPU cores and includes a suite of analysis tools that have been implemented in a massively parallel fashion. The software has been designed to interface conveniently with any dynamics engine and has already been used with a variety of molecular dynamics (e.g., GROMACS, NAMD, OpenMM, AMBER) and cell-modeling packages (e.g., BioNetGen, MCell). WESTPA has been in production use for over a year, and its utility has been demonstrated for a broad set of problems, ranging from atomically detailed host-guest associations to nonspatial chemical kinetics of cellular signaling networks.

Here, we review some of the recent studies on aqueous ILs that concern the role of water in altering the behavior of ILs in general and in case of biomolecules solvated in ILs. The different structural and dynamic effects caused by water have been highlighted. We discuss the different modes of IL interaction that are responsible for stabilization and destabilization of proteins and enzymes followed by examples of water effect on this. The role of water in the case of nucleic acid storage in ILs, an area which has mostly been underrated, also has been emphasized. Our discussions highlight the fact that the effects of water on IL behavior are not general and are highly dependent on the nature of the IL under consideration. Overall, we aim to draw attention to the significance of water dynamics in the aqueous IL solutions, a better understanding of which can help in developing superior storage materials for application purposes.},

abstract = {Anions enter from the cytoplasm into the channel pore of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) Cl− channel not via a central pathway but via a single lateral portal or fenestration. High Cl− conductance is dependent on electrostatic attraction of cytoplasmic Cl− ions by four positively charged amino acid side-chains located within this portal. Here we use a mutagenic approach to investigate the functional effects of transplanting or supplementing these positive charges at nearby portal-lining sites. Using patch clamp recording, we find that the functionally important positive charges at K190 and R303 can be transplanted to four nearby sites (N186, L197, W356, and A367) with little loss of Cl− conductance. Introduction of additional positive charge at these sites had almost no effect on Cl− conductance, but did increase the sensitivity to channel block by intracellular suramin and Pt(NO2)42− anions. We suggest that it is the number of positive charges within the portal, rather than their exact location, that is the most important factor influencing Cl− conductance. The portal appears well optimized in terms of charge distribution to maximize Cl− conductance.},

It has been unclear, however, whether any physical model (force field) used in MD simulations accurately describes both folded and disordered proteins. Here, we select a benchmark set of 21 systems, including folded and disordered proteins, simulate these systems with six state-of-the-art force fields, and compare the results to over 9,000 available experimental data points. We find that none of the tested force fields simultaneously provided accurate descriptions of folded proteins, of the dimensions of disordered proteins, and of the secondary structure propensities of disordered proteins. Guided by simulation results on a subset of our benchmark, however, we modified parameters of one force field, achieving excellent agreement with experiment for disordered proteins, while maintaining state-of-the-art accuracy for folded proteins. The resulting force field, a99SB-disp, should thus greatly expand the range of biological systems amenable to MD simulation. A similar approach could be taken to improve other force fields.},

abstract = {Calcium ions (Ca(2+) ) play key roles in various fundamental biological processes such as cell signaling and brain function. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have been used to study such interactions, however, the accuracy of the Ca(2+) models provided by the standard MD force fields has not been rigorously tested. Here, we assess the performance of the Ca(2+) models from the most popular classical force fields AMBER and CHARMM by computing the osmotic pressure of model compounds and the free energy of DNA-DNA interactions. In the simulations performed using the two standard models, Ca(2+) ions are seen to form artificial clusters with chloride, acetate, and phosphate species; the osmotic pressure of CaAc2 and CaCl2 solutions is a small fraction of the experimental values for both force fields. Using the standard parameterization of Ca(2+) ions in the simulations of Ca(2+) -mediated DNA-DNA interactions leads to qualitatively wrong outcomes: both AMBER and CHARMM simulations suggest strong inter-DNA attraction whereas, in experiment, DNA molecules repel one another. The artificial attraction of Ca(2+) to DNA phosphate is strong enough to affect the direction of the electric field-driven translocation of DNA through a solid-state nanopore. To address these shortcomings of the standard Ca(2+) model, we introduce a custom model of a hydrated Ca(2+) ion and show that using our model brings the results of the above MD simulations in quantitative agreement with experiment. Our improved model of Ca(2+) can be readily applied to MD simulations of various biomolecular systems, including nucleic acids, proteins and lipid bilayer membranes. {\textcopyright} 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Clathrin-mediated endocytosis was first described over 5 decades ago. Since its discovery, over 50 proteins have been shown to be part of the molecular machinery that generates the clathrin-coated endocytic vesicles. These proteins and the different steps of the endocytic process that they mediate have been studied in detail. However, we still lack a good understanding of how all these different components work together in a highly coordinated manner to drive vesicle formation. Nevertheless, studies in recent years have provided several important insights into how endocytic vesicles are built, starting from initiation, cargo loading and the mechanisms governing membrane bending to membrane scission and the release of the vesicle into the cytoplasm.},

abstract = {Background: N1303K, one of the common, severe disease-causing mutations in the CFTR gene, causes both defective biogenesis and gating abnormalities of the CFTR protein. The goals of the present study are to quantitatively assess the gating defects associated with the N1303K mutation and its pharmacological response to CFTR modulators including potentiators VX-770 and GLPG1837 and correctors VX-809, and VX-661. Methods: Gating behavior and pharmacological responses to CFTR potentiators were assessed using patch-clamp technique in the excised, inside-out mode. We also examined the effects of GLPG1837, VX-770, VX-809 and VX-661 on N1303K-CFTR surface expression using Western blot analysis. Results: Like wild-type (WT) CFTR, N1303K-CFTR channels were activated by protein kinase A-dependent phosphorylation, but the open probability (Po) of phosphorylated N1303K-CFTR was extremely low ({\~{}}0.03 vs {\~{}}0.45 in WT channels). N1303K mutants showed abnormal responses to ATP analogs or mutations that disrupt ATP hydrolysis and/or dimerization of CFTR's two nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs). However, the Po of N1303K-CFTR was dramatically increased by GLPG1837 ({\~{}}17-fold) and VX-770 ({\~{}}8-fold). VX-809 or VX-661 enhanced N1303K-CFTR maturation by 2–3 fold, and co-treatment with GLPG1837 or VX-770 did not show any negative drug-drug interaction. Conclusion: N1303K has a severe gating defect, reduced ATP-dependence and aberrant response to ATP analogs. These results suggest a defective function of the NBDs in N1303K-CFTR. An improvement of channel function by GLPG1837 or VX-770 and an increase of Band C protein by VX-809 or VX-661 support a therapeutic strategy of combining CFTR potentiator and corrector for patients carrying the N1303K mutation.},

abstract = {The Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Regulator (CFTR) is a membrane protein whose mutations cause cystic fibrosis, a lethal genetic disease. We performed a molecular dynamic (MD) study of the properties of the nucleotide binding domains (NBD) whose conformational changes, upon ATP binding, are the direct responsible of the gating mechanisms of CFTR. This study was done for the wild type (WT) CFTR and for the two most common mutations, $\Delta$F508, that produces a traffic defect of the protein, and the mutation G551D, that causes a gating defect on CFTR. Using an homology model of the open channel conformation of the CFTR we thus introduced the mutations to the structure. Although the overall structures of the G551D and $\Delta$F508 are quite well conserved, the NBD1-NBD2 interactions are severely modified in both mutants. NBD1 and NBD2 are indeed destabilized with a higher internal energy (Ei) in the $\Delta$F508-CFTR. Differently, Ei does not change in the NBDs of G551D but, while the number of close contacts between NBD1 and NBD2 in $\Delta$F508 is increased, a significant reduction of close contacts is found in the G551D mutated form. Hydrogen bonds formation between NBDs of the two mutated forms is also altered and it is slightly increased for the $\Delta$F508, while are severely reduced in G551D. A consequent modification of the NBDs-ICLs interactions between residues involved in the transduction of the ATP binding and the channel gating is also registered. Indeed, while a major interaction is noticed between NBDs interface and ICL2 and ICL4 in the WT, this interaction is somehow altered in both mutated forms plausibly with effect on channel gating. Thus, single point mutations of the CFTR protein can reasonably results in channel gating defects due to alteration of the interaction mechanisms between the NBDs and NBDs-ICLs interfaces upon ATP-binding process.},

abstract = {Elucidating the mechanism of sugar import requires a molecular understanding of how transporters couple sugar binding and gating events. Whereas mammalian glucose transporters (GLUTs) are specialists1, the hexose transporter from the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum PfHT12,3 has acquired the ability to transport both glucose and fructose sugars as efficiently as the dedicated glucose (GLUT3) and fructose (GLUT5) transporters. Here, to establish the molecular basis of sugar promiscuity in malaria parasites, we determined the crystal structure of PfHT1 in complex with d-glucose at a resolution of 3.6 {\AA}. We found that the sugar-binding site in PfHT1 is very similar to those of the distantly related GLUT3 and GLUT5 structures4,5. Nevertheless, engineered PfHT1 mutations made to match GLUT sugar-binding sites did not shift sugar preferences. The extracellular substrate-gating helix TM7b in PfHT1 was positioned in a fully occluded conformation, providing a unique glimpse into how sugar binding and gating are coupled. We determined that polar contacts between TM7b and TM1 (located about 15 {\AA} from d-glucose) are just as critical for transport as the residues that directly coordinate d-glucose, which demonstrates a strong allosteric coupling between sugar binding and gating. We conclude that PfHT1 has achieved substrate promiscuity not by modifying its sugar-binding site, but instead by evolving substrate-gating dynamics.},

The physical properties such as viscosity, conductivity, and surface tension of these DES are similar to ambient temperature ionic liquids and insight into the cause of these properties is gained using hole-theory. It is shown that the conductivity and viscosity of these liquids is controlled by ion mobility and the availability of voids of suitable dimensions, and this is consistent with the fluidity of other ionic liquids and molten salts. The DES are also shown to be good solvents for metal oxides, which could have potential application for metal extraction.},

Microsecond-long MD simulations allow us to observe several binding events, following different dynamical routes and reaching diverse binding configurations. These simulations are used to estimate kinetic and thermodynamic quantities, such as k on and binding free energy, obtaining a good agreement with available experimental data.

@article{McDaniel2019,
abstract = {Although the like-dissolves-like rule is often invoked to explain why sodium chloride dissolves in water, hidden behind this explanation is the delicate balance between the very large cohesive energy of the ionic crystal and large solvation energies of the ions. Room-temperature ionic liquids (ILs) are liquid analogues of ionic crystals and, as dictated by a similar energetic balance, may either fully mix with water or be immiscible with water depending on ion type and cation/anion combination. In this work, we study three hydrophobic and three hydrophilic ILs to examine whether a priori prediction of water miscibility is possible based on analysis of bulk properties alone. We find that hydrophilic and hydrophobic ILs exhibit distinct signatures in their (reciprocal space) Coulomb interactions that indicate predisposition to water mixing. Hydrophilic ILs exhibit a prominent peak in their electrostatic interactions at 58-length scale, largely due to repulsion between neighboring anion shells. When mixed with water, this peak is significantly reduced in magnitude, indicating that electrostatic screening by water molecules is an important driving force for mixing. In contrast, hydrophobic ILs show no such peak, indicating no predisposition to mixing. In addition to this analysis, we compute and compare solvation free energies of the six different anions in water, ion-pairing free energies at infinitely dilute concentration, and water absorption free energies in the different ILs. Analyzed within the context of empirical data, our calculations suggest that hydrophobicity trends of different ILs are very sensitive to precise water content at dilute conditions. For example, we predict that bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide-based ILs exhibit anomalously large water absorption free energies at zero water content, with increasing hydrophobicity as preferential absorption sites within the IL become saturated.},

However, the result of a simulation is a large, high-dimensional time series that is difficult to interpret. Recent work has introduced the time-structure based Independent Components Analysis (tICA) method for analyzing MD, which attempts to find the slowest decorrelating linear functions of the molecular coordinates. This method has been used in conjunction with Markov State Models (MSMs) to provide estimates of the characteristic eigenprocesses contained in a simulation (e.g., protein folding, ligand binding). Here, we extend the tICA method using the kernel trick to arrive at nonlinear solutions. This is a substantial improvement as it allows for kernel-tICA (ktICA) to provide estimates of the characteristic eigenprocesses directly without building an MSM.},

With the help of these two variables the authors combine features of approaches such as metadynamics or umbrella sampling with those of path based methods. This allows global searches in the space of paths to be performed and a new variational principle for the determination of low free energy paths to be established. Contrary to metadynamics or umbrella sampling the path can be described by an arbitrary large number of variables, still the energy profile along the path can be calculated. The authors exemplify the method numerically by studying the conformational changes of alanine dipeptide. {\textcopyright} 2007 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = {{\_}Spin Dynamics: Basics of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, Second Edition{\_} is a comprehensive and modern introduction which focuses on those essential principles and concepts needed for a thorough understanding of the subject, rather than the practical aspects. The quantum theory of nuclear magnets is presented within a strong physical framework, supported by figures. The book assumes only a basic knowledge of complex numbers and matrices, and provides the reader with numerous worked examples and exercises to encourage understanding. With the explicit aim of carefully developing the subject from the beginning, the text starts with coverage of quarks and nucleons and progresses through to a detailed explanation of several important NMR experiments, including NMR imaging, COSY, NOESY and TROSY. Completely revised and updated, the Second Edition features new material on the properties and distributions of isotopes, chemical shift anisotropy and quadrupolar interactions, Pake patterns, spin echoes, slice selection in NMR imaging, and a complete new chapter on the NMR spectroscopy of quadrupolar nuclei. New appendices have been included on Euler angles, and coherence selection by field gradients. As in the first edition, all material is heavily supported by graphics, much of which is new to this edition. Written for undergraduates and postgraduate students taking a first course in NMR spectroscopy and for those needing an up-to-date account of the subject, this multi-disciplinary book will appeal to chemical, physical, material, life, medical, earth and environmental scientists.

abstract = {Many applications in chemistry, biology, and energy storage/conversion research rely on molecular simulations to provide fundamental insight into structural and transport properties of materials with high ionic concentrations. Whether the system is comprised entirely of ions, like ionic liquids, or is a mixture of a polar solvent with a salt, e.g., liquid electrolytes for battery applications, the presence of ions in these materials results in strong local electric fields polarizing solvent molecules and large ions. To predict properties of such systems from molecular simulations often requires either explicit or mean-field inclusion of the influence of polarization on electrostatic interactions. In this manuscript, we review the pros and cons of different treatments of polarization ranging from the mean-field approaches to the most popular explicit polarization models in molecular dynamics simulations of ionic materials. For each method, we discuss their advantages and disadvantages and emphasize key assumptions as well as their adjustable parameters. Strategies for the development of polarizable models are presented with a specific focus on extracting atomic polarizabilities. Finally, we compare simulations using polarizable and nonpolarizable models for several classes of ionic systems, discussing the underlying physics that each approach includes or ignores, implications for implementation and computational efficiency, and the accuracy of properties predicted by these methods compared to experiments.},

Although general features of the structure of CFTR have been predicted from homology models, the conformational changes that result in channel opening and closing have yet to be resolved. We created new closed- and open-state homology models of CFTR, and performed targeted molecular dynamics simulations of the conformational transitions in a channel opening event. The simulations predict a conformational wave that starts at the nucleotide binding domains and ends with the formation of an open conduction pathway. Changes in side-chain interactions are observed in all major domains of the protein, and experimental confirmation was obtained for a novel intra-protein salt bridge that breaks near the end of the transition. The models and simulation add to our understanding of the mechanism of ATP-dependent gating in this disease-relevant ion channel. {\textcopyright} 2013 Rahman et al.},

All DESs showed good ability to extract thiophene with the best extraction efficiency (35{\%}) being observed for the sulfolane-based DES. The extraction efficiency can be further enhanced to reach 98{\%} when five extraction cycles are performed. Moreover, the DESs were easily regenerated using rotary evaporation. In addition,1H NMR analysis is used to elucidate the extraction mechanism. Finally, the COSMO-RS model was used to predict the ternary tie lines for the studied systems and the NRTL model allowed, correlating the experimental data with an average root-mean-square deviation of {\textless}2{\%} for all DESs.

abstract = {The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) anion channel is essential to maintain fluid homeostasis in key organs such as the lungs or the digestive systems. Functional impairment of CFTR due to mutation in the cftr gene lead to Cystic Fibrosis (CF) the most common lethal genetic disorder. Here we observe that the first nucleotide-binding domain (NBD1) of CFTR can spontaneously adopt an alternative conformation that departs from the canonical NBD fold previously observed for CFTR and other ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter proteins. Crystallography studies reveal that this conformation involves a topological reorganization of the $\beta$-subdomain of NBD1. This alternative state is adopted by wild-type CFTR in cells, where it leads to enhanced channel activity. Single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer microscopy shows that the equilibrium between the conformations is regulated by ATP binding. However, under destabilizing conditions, such as a the prominent disease-causing mutation F508el , this conformational flexibility enables unfolding of the $\beta$-subdomain. Our data indicate that in wild-type CFTR switching to this topologically-swapped conformation of NBD1 regulates channel function, but, in the presence of the F508del mutation, it allows domain misfolding and subsequent protein degradation. Our work provides a framework to design conformation-specific therapeutics to prevent noxious transitions.},

abstract = {Separation of aromatics from aliphatics is a challenging process because of the close range of their boiling points and the formation of several combinations of azeotropes. Until now, no feasible separation process is available for aromatic concentrations below 20 wt{\%}. In this work, we have investigated the possibility of using a selected deep eutectic solvent (DES) for the liquid-liquid extraction of benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and m-xylene (BTEX) aromatics. The DES used in this work was synthesized by combining tetrabutylammonium salt and sulfolane. Equilibrium data for the ternary system consisting of BTEX aromatics, n-octane and DES were measured at 25 °C and atmospheric pressure. The results showed that the used DESs have comparable distribution ratios and selectivities to those of commercial solvents. In all tested systems, sulfolane was not present in the hydrocarbon layer. It was also found that the selectivity decreases with decreasing polarity of the aromatic compound. The Non-Random Two Liquid (NRTL) model was successfully used to correlate the experimental tie-lines and to calculate the phase compositions of the ternary systems. In addition, the performance of COSMO-RS to predict the ternary tie-lines for the studied systems was evaluated and the $\sigma$-profiles were used to explain the interaction between the DES and the aromatic compounds.

We first transfected Cos-7 cells (green monkey kidney cells) with A455E, S492F, $\Delta$I507, or R560T and created HEK-293 (human embryonic kidney cells) cell lines stably expressing these CFTR mutations. The mutants showed lowered protein expression, instability at physiological temperature, and rapid degradation. After treatment with correctors CFFT-002, CFFT-003, C3, C4, and/or C18, the combination of C18+C4 showed the most correction and resulted in increased CFTR residing in the plasma membrane. We found a profound decrease in binding of CFTR to histone deacetylases (HDAC) 6 and 7 and heat shock proteins (Hsps) 27 and 40. Silencing Hsp27 or 40 rescued the mutants, but no additional amount of CFTR was rescued when both proteins were knocked down simultaneously. Thus, CFTR mutations in NBD1 can be rescued by a combination of correctors, and the treatment alters the interaction between mutated CFTR and the endoplasmic reticulum machinery.},

abstract = {Many different ion channel pores are thought to have charged amino acid residues clustered around their entrances. The so-called surface charges contributed by these residues can play important roles in attracting oppositely charged ions from the bulk solution on one side of the membrane, increasing effective local counterion concentration and favoring rapid ion movement through the channel. Here we use site-directed mutagenesis to identify arginine residues contributing important surface charges in the intracellular mouth of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) Cl- channel pore. While wild-type CFTR was associated with a linear current-voltage relationship with symmetrical solutions, strong outward rectification was observed after mutagenesis of two arginine residues (R303 and R352) located near the intracellular ends of the fifth and sixth transmembrane regions. Current rectification was dependent on the charge present at these positions, consistent with an electrostatic effect. Furthermore, mutagenesis-induced rectification was more pronounced at lower Cl- concentrations, suggesting that these mutants had a reduced ability to concentrate Cl- ions near the inner pore mouth. R303 and R352 mutants exhibited reduced single channel conductance, especially at negative membrane potentials, that was dependent on the charge of the amino acid residue present at these positions. However, the very low conductance of both R303E and R352E-CFTR could be greatly increased by elevating intracellular Cl- concentration. Modification of an introduced cysteine residue at position 303 by charged methanethiosulfonate reagents reproduced charge-dependent effects on current rectification. Mutagenesis of arginine residues in the second and tenth transmembrane regions also altered channel permeation properties, however these effects were not consistent with changes in channel surface charges. These results suggest that positively charged arginine residues act to concentrate Cl- ions at the inner mouth of the CFTR pore, and that this contributes to maximization of the rate of Cl- ion permeation through the pore. {\textcopyright} The Rockefeller University Press.},

abstract = {Cystic fibrosis is a lethal genetic disease caused by lack of functional cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) proteins at the apical surface of secretory epithelia. CFTR is a multidomain protein, containing five domains, and its functional structure is attained in a hierarchical folding process. Most CF-causing mutations in CFTR, including the most common mutation, a deletion of phenylalanine at position 508 ({\{}increment{\}}F508), are unable to properly fold into this functional native three dimensional structure. Currently, no highresolution structural information about full length CFTR exists. However, insight has been gained through examining homologous ABC transporter structures, molecular modeling, and high-resolution structures of individual, isolated CFTR domains. Taken together, these studies indicate that the prevalent $\delta$F508 mutation disrupts two essential steps during the development of the native structure: folding of the first nucleotide binding domain (NBD1) and its later association with the fourth intracellular loop (ICL4) in the second transmembrane domain (TMD2). Therapeutics to rescue {\{}increment{\}}F508 and other mutants in CFTR can be targeted to correct defects that occur during the complex folding process. This article reviews the structural relationships between CFTR and ABC transporters and current knowledge about how CFTR attains its structure-with a focus on how this process is altered by CF-causing mutations in a manner targetable by therapeutics. {\textcopyright} 2012 Patrick and Thomas.},

Most class-III and class-IV mutants respond well to the recently approved potentiator VX-770, which opens the channel. We here revisited function and folding of some class-IV mutants and discovered that R347P is the only one that leads to major defects in folding. By this criterion and by its functional response to corrector drug VX-809, R347P qualifies also as a class-II mutation. Other class-IV mutants folded like wild-type CFTR and responded similarly to VX-809, demonstrating how function and folding are connected. Studies on both types of defects complement each other in understanding how compounds improve mutant CFTR function. This provides an attractive unbiased approach for characterizing mode of action of novel therapeutic compounds and helps address which drugs are efficacious for each cystic fibrosis disease variant.},

We have here implemented the CHARMM force field and all necessary extended functional forms in the GROMACS molecular simulation package, to make CHARMM-specific features available and to test them in combination with techniques for extended time steps, to make all major force fields available for comparison studies in GROMACS, and to test various solvent model optimizations, in particular the effect of Lennard-Jones interactions on hydrogens. The implementation has full support both for CHARMM-specific features such as multiple potentials over the same dihedral angle and the grid-based energy correction map on the $\phi$, $\psi$ protein backbone dihedrals, as well as all GROMACS features such as virtual hydrogen interaction sites that enable 5 fs time steps. The medium-to-long time effects of both the correction maps and virtual sites have been tested by performing a series of 100 ns simulations using different models for water representation, including comparisons between CHARMM and traditional TIP3P. Including the correction maps improves sampling of near native-state conformations in our systems, and to some extent it is even able to refine distorted protein conformations. Finally, we show that this accuracy is largely maintained with a new implicit solvent implementation that works with virtual interaction sites, which enables performance in excess of 250 ns/day for a 900-atom protein on a quad-core desktop computer.

abstract = {Dramatic functional changes of enzyme usually require scores of alterations in amino acid sequence. However, in the case of guanylate kinase (GK), the functional novelty is induced by a single (S→P) mutation, leading to the functional transition of the enzyme from a phosphoryl transfer kinase into a phosphorprotein interaction domain. Here, by using molecular dynamic (MD) and metadynamics simulations, we provide a comprehensive description of the conformational transitions of the enzyme after mutating serine to proline. Our results suggest that the serine plays a crucial role in maintaining the closed conformation of wild-type GK and the GMP recognition. On the contrary, the S→P mutant exhibits a stable open conformation and loses the ability of ligand binding, which explains its functional transition from the GK enzyme to the GK domain. Furthermore, the free energy profiles (FEPs) obtained by metadymanics clearly demonstrate that the open-closed conformational transition in WT GK is positive correlated with the process of GMP binding, indicating the GMP-induced closing motion of GK enzyme, which is not observed in the mutant. In addition, the FEPs show that the S→P mutation can also leads to the mis-recognition of GMP, explaining the vanishing of catalytic activity of the mutant.},

abstract = {Background: N1303K, one of the common, severe disease-causing mutations in the CFTR gene, causes both defective biogenesis and gating abnormalities of the CFTR protein. The goals of the present study are to quantitatively assess the gating defects associated with the N1303K mutation and its pharmacological response to CFTR modulators including potentiators VX-770 and GLPG1837 and correctors VX-809, and VX-661. Methods: Gating behavior and pharmacological responses to CFTR potentiators were assessed using patch-clamp technique in the excised, inside-out mode. We also examined the effects of GLPG1837, VX-770, VX-809 and VX-661 on N1303K-CFTR surface expression using Western blot analysis. Results: Like wild-type (WT) CFTR, N1303K-CFTR channels were activated by protein kinase A-dependent phosphorylation, but the open probability (Po) of phosphorylated N1303K-CFTR was extremely low ({\~{}}0.03 vs {\~{}}0.45 in WT channels). N1303K mutants showed abnormal responses to ATP analogs or mutations that disrupt ATP hydrolysis and/or dimerization of CFTR's two nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs). However, the Po of N1303K-CFTR was dramatically increased by GLPG1837 ({\~{}}17-fold) and VX-770 ({\~{}}8-fold). VX-809 or VX-661 enhanced N1303K-CFTR maturation by 2–3 fold, and co-treatment with GLPG1837 or VX-770 did not show any negative drug-drug interaction. Conclusion: N1303K has a severe gating defect, reduced ATP-dependence and aberrant response to ATP analogs. These results suggest a defective function of the NBDs in N1303K-CFTR. An improvement of channel function by GLPG1837 or VX-770 and an increase of Band C protein by VX-809 or VX-661 support a therapeutic strategy of combining CFTR potentiator and corrector for patients carrying the N1303K mutation.},

Among all the neutral, acid and basic DESs, choline chloride/2polyethylene glycol (ChCl/2PEG) showed the best performance and 99.1{\%} of dibenzothiophene (DBT) could be eliminated from model oil at 50 °C within 3 h. Interestingly, the volume ratio of DES to model oil was just 1:10, which was much less than the amount of extractant in the literature. The gas chromatography–mass spectrometer (GC–MS) analysis demonstrated that DBT sulfoxide (DBTO) and sulfone (DBTO2) were the products of oxidation of DBT. The desulfurization efficiency of the five sulfides in ECODS system occured in the following order: DBT {\textgreater} 4-MDBT {\textgreater} 4,6-DMDBT {\textgreater} 3-MBT {\textgreater}BT.},

abstract = {High cost and high energy penalty for CO2uptake from flue gases are important obstacles in large-scale industrial applications, and developing efficient technology for CO2capture from technical and economic points is crucial. Ionic liquids (ILs) show the potential for CO2separation owing to their inherent advantages, and have been proposed as alternatives to overcome the drawbacks of conventional sorbents. Chemical modification of ILs to improve their performance in CO2absorption has received more attention. Deep eutectic solvents (DESs) as a new generation of ILs are considered as more economical alternatives to cope with the deficiencies of high cost and high viscosity of conventional ILs. This Review discusses the potential of functionalized ILs and DESs as CO2sorbents. Incorporation of CO2-philic functional groups, such as amine, in cation and/or anion moiety of ILs can promot their absorption capacity. In general, the functionalization of the anion part of ILs is more effective than the cation part. DESs represent favorable solvent properties and are capable of capturing CO2, but the research work is scarce and undeveloped compared to the studies conducted on ILs. It is possible to develop novel DESs with promising absorption capacity. However, more investigation needs to be carried out on the mechanism of CO2sorption of DESs to clarify how these novel sorbents can be adjusted and fine-tuned to be best tailored as optimized media for CO2capture.},

@article{Souphron2008,
abstract = {Post-translational covalent modification by ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like proteins (UBLs) is a major eukaryotic mechanism for regulating protein function. In general, each UBL has its own E1 that serves as the entry point for a cascade. The E1 first binds the UBL and catalyzes adenylation of the UBL's C-terminus, prior to promoting UBL transfer to a downstream E2. Ubiquitin's Arg 72, which corresponds to Ala72 in the UBL NEDD8, is a key E1 selectivity determinant: swapping ubiquitin and NEDD8 residue 72 identity was shown previously to swap their E1 specificity. Correspondingly, Arg190 in the UBA3 subunit of NEDD8's heterodimeric E1 (the APPBP1-UBA3 complex), which corresponds to a Gln in ubiquitin's E1 UBA1, is a key UBL selectivity determinant. Here, we dissect this specificity with biochemical and X-ray crystallographic analysis of APPBP1-UBA3-NEDD8 complexes in which NEDD8's residue 72 and UBA3's residue 190 are substituted with different combinations of Ala, Arg, or Gln. APPBP1-UBA3's preference for NEDD8's Ala72 appears to be indirect, due to proper positioning of UBA3's Arg190. By contrast, our data are consistent with direct positive interactions between ubiquitin's Arg72 and an E1's Gln. However, APPBP1-UBA3's failure to interact with a UBL having Arg72 is not due to a lack of this favorable interaction, but rather arises from UBA3's Arg 190 acting as a negative gate. Thus, parallel residues from different UBL pathways can utilize distinct mechanisms to dictate interaction selectivity, and specificity can be amplified by barriers that prevent binding to components of different conjugation cascades. {\textcopyright} 2008 American Chemical Society.},

However, relaxation times corresponding to reorganisation of molecular dipoles due to their interaction with electromagnetic radiation at microwave frequencies are within the scope of modern molecular simulations. In this work, fluctuations of the total dipole moment of a molecular system, obtained through molecular dynamics simulations, are used to determine the dielectric spectra of water, a series of alcohols and glycols, and monoethanolamine. Although the force fields employed in this study have principally been developed to describe thermodynamic properties, most them give fairly good predictions of this dynamical property for these systems. However, the inaccuracy of some models and the long simulation times required for the accurate estimation of the static dielectric constant can sometimes be problematic. We show that the use of the experimental value for the static dielectric constant in the calculations, instead of the one predicted by the different models, yields satisfactory results for the dielectric spectra, and hence the heat absorbed from microwaves, avoiding the need for extraordinarily long simulations or re-calibration of molecular models.},

abstract = {The growing interest in the complexity of biological interactions is continuously driving the need to increase system size in biophysical simulations, requiring not only powerful and advanced hardware but adaptable software that can accommodate a large number of atoms interacting through complex forcefields. To address this, we developed and implemented strategies in the GENESIS molecular dynamics package designed for large numbers of processors. Long-range electrostatic interactions were parallelized by minimizing the number of processes involved in communication. A novel algorithm was implemented for nonbonded interactions to increase single instruction multiple data (SIMD) performance, reducing memory usage for ultra large systems. Memory usage for neighbor searches in real-space nonbonded interactions was reduced by approximately 80{\%}, leading to significant speedup. Using experimental data describing physical 3D chromatin interactions, we constructed the first atomistic model of an entire gene locus (GATA4). Taken together, these developments enabled the first billion-atom simulation of an intact biomolecular complex, achieving scaling to 65,000 processes (130,000 processor cores) with 1 ns/day performance.

abstract = {We introduce a powerful method for exploring the properties of the multidimensional free energy surfaces (FESs) of complex many-body systems by means of coarse-grained non-Markovian dynamics in the space defined by a few collective coordinates. A characteristic feature of these dynamics is the presence of a history-dependent potential term that, in time, fills the minima in the FES, allowing the efficient exploration and accurate determination of the FES as a function of the collective coordinates. We demonstrate the usefulness of this approach in the case of the dissociation of a NaCl molecule in water and in the study of the conformational changes of a dialanine in solution.},

abstract = {The human protein TDP-43 is a major component of the cellular aggregates found in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and other neurodegenerative diseases. Insoluble cytoplasmic aggregates isolated from the brain of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal lobar degeneration patients contain ubiquitinated, hyperphosphorylated, and N-terminally truncated TDP-43. Truncated fragments of TDP-43 identified from patient tissues contain part of the second RNA recognition motif (RRM2) and the disordered C-terminus, indicating that both domains can be involved in aggregation and toxicity. Here, we focus on RRM2. Using all-atom replica-averaged metadynamics simulations with NMR chemical shift restraints, we characterized the atomic structure of non-native states of RRM2, sparsely populated under native conditions. These structures reveal the exposure to the solvent of aggregation-prone peptide regions, normally buried in the native state, supporting a role in aggregation for the partially folded states of RRM2.},

abstract = {Calculations of ligand binding free energies and kinetic rates are important for drug design. However, such tasks have proven challenging in computational chemistry and biophysics. To address this challenge, we have developed a new computational method, ligand Gaussian accelerated molecular dynamics (LiGaMD), which selectively boosts the ligand nonbonded interaction potential energy based on the Gaussian accelerated molecular dynamics (GaMD) enhanced sampling technique. Another boost potential could be applied to the remaining potential energy of the entire system in a dual-boost algorithm (LiGaMD{\_}Dual) to facilitate ligand binding. LiGaMD has been demonstrated on host-guest and protein-ligand binding model systems. Repetitive guest binding and unbinding in the $\beta$-cyclodextrin host were observed in hundreds-of-nanosecond LiGaMD{\_}Dual simulations. The calculated guest binding free energies agreed excellently with experimental data with {\textless}1.0 kcal/mol errors. Compared with converged microsecond-time scale conventional molecular dynamics simulations, the sampling errors of LiGaMD{\_}Dual simulations were also {\textless}1.0 kcal/mol. Accelerations of ligand kinetic rate constants in LiGaMD simulations were properly estimated using Kramers' rate theory. Furthermore, LiGaMD allowed us to capture repetitive dissociation and binding of the benzamidine inhibitor in trypsin within 1 $\mu$s simulations. The calculated ligand binding free energy and kinetic rate constants compared well with the experimental data. In summary, LiGaMD provides a powerful enhanced sampling approach for characterizing ligand binding thermodynamics and kinetics simultaneously, which is expected to facilitate computer-aided drug design.},

abstract = {The protein kinase Akt controls myriad signaling processes in cells, ranging from growth and proliferation to differentiation and metabolism. Akt is activated by a combination of binding to the lipid second messenger PI(3,4,5)P3 and its subsequent phosphorylation by phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 and mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 2. The relative contributions of these mechanisms to Akt activity and signaling have hitherto not been understood. Here, we show that phosphorylation and activation by membrane binding are mutually interdependent. Moreover, the converse is also true: Akt is more rapidly dephosphorylated in the absence of PIP3, an autoinhibitory process driven by the interaction of its PH and kinase domains. We present biophysical evidence for the conformational changes in Akt that accompany its activation on membranes, show that Akt is robustly autoinhibited in the absence of PIP3 irrespective of its phosphorylation, and map the autoinhibitory PH−kinase interface. Finally, we present a model for the activation and inactivation of Akt by an ordered series of membrane binding, phosphorylation, dissociation, and dephosphorylation events.},

abstract = {The cystic fibrosis (CF) transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) bears six extracellular loops (ECL1-6); ECL1 is the site of several mutations associated with CF. Mutation R117H has been reported to reduce current amplitude, whereas D110H, E116K, and R117C/L/P may impair channel stability. We hypothesized that these amino acids might not be directly involved in ion conduction and permeation but may contribute to stabilizing the outer vestibule architecture in CFTR. We used cRNA injected oocytes combined with electrophysiological techniques to test this hypothesis. Mutants bearing cysteine at these sites were not functionally modified by extracellular MTS reagents and were blocked by GlyH-101 similarly to WT-CFTR. These results suggest that these three residues do not contribute directly to permeation in CFTR. In contrast, mutants D110R-, E116R-, and R117A-CFTR exhibited instability of the open state and significantly shortened burst duration compared with WT-CFTR and failed to be locked into the open state by AMP-PNP (adenosine 5'-({\ss},$\gamma$-imido) triphosphate); charge-retaining mutants showed mainly the full open state with comparably longer open burst duration. These interactions suggest that these ECL1 residues might be involved in maintaining the outer pore architecture of CFTR. A CFTR homology model suggested that E116 interacts with R104 in both the closed and open states, D110 interacts with K892 in the fully closed state, and R117 interacts with E1126 in the open state. These interactions were confirmed experimentally. The results suggest that D110, E116, and R117 may contribute to stabilizing the architecture of the outer pore of CFTR by interactions with other charged residues. {\textcopyright} 2014 Cui et al.},

abstract = {A theoretical framework is elaborated to account for the effect of a transmembrane potential in computer simulations. It is shown that a simulation with a constant external electric field applied in the direction normal to the membrane is equivalent to the influence of surrounding infinite baths maintained to a voltage difference via ion-exchanging electrodes connected to an electromotive force. It is also shown that the linearly-weighted displacement charge within the simulation system tracks the net flow of charge through the external circuit comprising the electromotive force and the electrodes. Using a statistical mechanical reduction of the degrees of freedom of the external system, three distinct theoretical routes are formulated and examined for the purpose of characterizing the free energy of a protein embedded in a membrane that is submitted to a voltage difference. The W-route is constructed from the variations in the voltage-dependent potential of mean force along a reaction path connecting two conformations of the protein. The Q-route is based on the average displacement charge as a function of the conformation of the protein. Finally, the G-route considers the relative charging free energy of specific residues, with and without applied membrane potentials. The theoretical formulation is illustrated with a simple model of an ion crossing a vacuum slab surrounded by two aqueous bulk phases and with a fragment of the voltage-sensor of the KvAP potassium channel. {\textcopyright} 2008 by the Biophysical Society.},

abstract = {Missense DNA variants have variable effects upon protein function. Consequently, interpreting their pathogenicity is challenging, especially when they are associated with disease variability. To determine the degree to which functional assays inform interpretation, we analyzed 48 CFTR missense variants associated with variable expressivity of cystic fibrosis (CF). We assessed function in a native isogenic context by evaluating CFTR mutants that were stably expressed in the genome of a human airway cell line devoid of endogenous CFTR expression. 21 of 29 variants associated with full expressivity of the CF phenotype generated {\textless}10{\%} wild-type CFTR (WT-CFTR) function, a conservative threshold for the development of life-limiting CF lung disease, and five variants had moderately decreased function (10{\%} to ∼25{\%} WT-CFTR). The remaining three variants in this group unexpectedly had {\textgreater}25{\%} WT-CFTR function; two were higher than 75{\%} WT-CFTR. As expected, 14 of 19 variants associated with partial expressivity of CF had {\textgreater}25{\%} WT-CFTR function; however, four had minimal to no effect on CFTR function ({\textgreater}75{\%} WT-CFTR). Thus, 6 of 48 (13{\%}) missense variants believed to be disease causing did not alter CFTR function. Functional studies substantially refined pathogenicity assignment with expert annotation and criteria from the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and Association for Molecular Pathology. However, four algorithms (CADD, REVEL, SIFT, and PolyPhen-2) could not differentiate between variants that caused severe, moderate, or minimal reduction in function. In the setting of variable expressivity, these results indicate that functional assays are essential for accurate interpretation of missense variants and that current prediction tools should be used with caution.},

abstract = {Mutations in the Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (CFTR) gene affect CFTR protein biogenesis or its function as a chloride channel, resulting in dysregulation of epithelial fluid transport in the lung, pancreas and other organs in cystic fibrosis (CF). Development of pharmaceutical strategies to treat CF requires understanding of the mechanisms underlying channel function. However, incomplete 3D structural information on the unique ABC ion channel, CFTR, hinders elucidation of its functional mechanism and correction of cystic fibrosis causing mutants. Several CFTR homology models have been developed using bacterial ABC transporters as templates but these have low sequence similarity to CFTR and are not ion channels. Here, we refine an earlier model in an outward (OWF) and develop an inward (IWF) facing model employing an integrated experimental-molecular dynamics simulation (200 ns) approach. Our IWF structure agrees well with a recently solved cryo-EM structure of a CFTR IWF state. We utilize cysteine cross-linking to verify positions and orientations of residues within trans-membrane helices (TMHs) of the OWF conformation and to reconstruct a physiologically relevant pore structure. Comparison of pore profiles of the two conformations reveal a radius sufficient to permit passage of hydrated Cl-ions in the OWF but not the IWF model. To identify structural determinants that distinguish the two conformations and possible rearrangements of TMHs within them responsible for channel gating, we perform cross-linking by bifunctional reagents of multiple predicted pairs of cysteines in TMH 6 and 12 and 6 and 9. To determine whether the effects of cross-linking on gating observed are the result of switching of the channel from open to close state, we also treat the same residue pairs with monofunctional reagents in separate experiments. Both types of reagents prevent ion currents indicating that pore blockage is primarily responsible.},

The insertion of urea molecules was found to change the density distribution of cations and anions around the given cations significantly, disrupting the long-range ordered structure of choline chloride. Moreover, with increasing urea concentration, the hydrogen bond interactions between choline cations and Cl- anions decreased, while those among urea molecules obviously increased. From the hydrogen bond lifetimes, it was found that a ratio of 1:2 between choline chloride and urea is necessary for a reasonable strength of hydrogen bond interaction to maintain the low melting point of the mixture of choline chloride with urea. In addition, it was also deduced from the interaction energies that a urea content of 67.7 {\%} may make the interactions of cation-anion, cation-urea and anion-urea modest, and thus results in the lower melting point of the eutectic mixture of choline chloride and urea. The present results may offer assistance to some extent for understanding the physicochemical properties of the eutectic mixture of choline chloride and urea, and give valuable information for the further development and application of deep eutectic solvents. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

We have modified the existing VIS algorithm for most lipids in the popular CHARMM36 force field by increasing the hydrogen atom masses at regular intervals in the lipid acyl chains and obtained lipid properties and pore formation free energies in very good agreement with those calculated in simulations without VIS. Our modified VIS scheme enables a 5 fs time step resulting in a significant performance gain for all-atom simulations of membranes. The method has the potential to make longer time and length scales accessible in all-atom simulations of membrane-protein complexes.},

abstract = {Cystic fibrosis (CF) is mainly caused by mutations that interfere with the biosynthetic folding of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) chloride channel. The aim of this study was to determine the mechanism of dysfunction of a disease-causing mutation associated with variable phenotypes. In order to attain these objectives, we studied the effect of the p.L206W mutation on CFTR protein production and function, and we examined the genotype-phenotype correlation of [p.L206W] + [p.F508del] patients. We showed that p.L206W is a processing (class II) mutation since the CFTR biosynthetic pathway was severely impaired, whereas single-channel measurements indicated ion conductance similar to the wild-type protein. These data raise the larger question of the phenotypic variability of class II mutants, including p.F508del. Since multiple potential partners could modify the processing of the CFTR protein during its course to the cell surface, environmental and other genetic factors might contribute to this variability. {\textcopyright} 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

abstract = {Chemical denaturants are frequently used to unfold proteins and to characterize mechanisms and transition states of protein folding reactions. The molecular basis of the effect of urea and guanidinium chloride (GdmCl) on polypeptide chains is still not well understood. Models for denaturant-protein interaction include both direct binding and indirect changes in solvent properties. Here we report studies on the effect of urea and GdmCl on the rate constants (kc) of end-to-end diffusion in unstructured poly(glycine-serine) chains of different length. Urea and GdmCl both lead to a linear decrease of ln kc with denaturant concentration, as observed for the rate constants for protein folding. This suggests that the effect of denaturants on chain dynamics significantly contributes to the denaturant-dependence of folding rate constants for small proteins. We show that this linear dependency is the result of two additive non-linear effects, namely increased solvent viscosity and denaturant binding. The contribution from denaturant binding can be quantitatively described by Schellman's weak binding model with binding constants (K) of 0.62(±0.01) M-1 for GdmCl and 0.26(±0.01) M-1 for urea. In our model peptides the number of binding sites and the effect of a bound denaturant molecule on chain dynamics is identical for urea and GdmCl. The results further identify the polypeptide backbone as the major denaturant binding site and give an upper limit of a few nanoseconds for residence times of denaturant molecules on the polypeptide chain. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {In the past two decades, transmembrane channel-like (TMC) proteins have attracted a significant amount of research interest, because mutations of Tmc1 lead to hereditary deafness. As evolutionarily conserved membrane proteins, TMC proteins are widely involved in diverse sensorimotor functions of many species, such as hearing, chemosensation, egg laying, and food texture detection. Interestingly, recent structural and physiological studies suggest that TMC channels may share a similar membrane topology with the Ca2+-activated Cl− channel TMEM16 and the mechanically activated OSCA1.2/TMEM63 channel. Namely, these channels form dimers and each subunit consists of ten transmembrane segments. Despite this important structural insight, a key question remains: what is the gating mechanism of TMC channels? The major technical hurdle to answer this question is that the reconstitution of TMC proteins as functional ion channels has been challenging in mammalian heterologous systems. Since TMC channels are conserved across taxa, genetic studies of TMC channels in model organisms such as C. elegans, Drosophila, and zebrafish may provide us critical information on the physiological function and regulation of TMCs. Here, we present a comparative overview on the diverse functions of TMC channels in different species.},

This technique measures the number density, diffusion coefficient, and velocity of fluorescently labeled macromolecules in a cell membrane imaged on a confocal, two-photon, or total internal reflection fluorescence microscope. In contrast to r-space correlation techniques, we show kICS can recover accurate dynamics even in the presence of complex fluorophore photobleaching and/or "blinking". Furthermore, these quantities can be calculated without nonlinear curve fitting, or any knowledge of the beam radius of the exciting laser. The number densities calculated by kICS are less sensitive to spatial inhomogeneity of the fluorophore distribution than densities measured using image correlation spectroscopy. We use simulations as a proof-of-principle to show that number densities and transport coefficients can be extracted using this technique. We present calibration measurements with fluorescent microspheres imaged on a confocal microscope, which recover Stokes-Einstein diffusion coefficients, and flow velocities that agree with single particle tracking measurements.

abstract = {Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is a chloride channel belonging to the ATP binding cassette (ABC) protein superfamily. Currently, it remains unclear how ATP binding causes the opening of the channel gate at the molecular level. To clarify this mechanism, we first constructed an atomic model of the inward-facing CFTR using the X-ray structures of other ABC proteins. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were then performed to explore the structure and dynamics of the inward-facing CFTR in a membrane environment. In the MgATP-bound state, two nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs) formed a head-to-tail type of dimer, in which the ATP molecules were sandwiched between the Walker A and signature motifs. Alternatively, one of the final MD structures in the apo state was similar to that of a "closed-apo" conformation found in the X-ray analysis of ATP-free MsbA. Principal component analysis for the MD trajectory indicated that NBD dimerization causes significant structural and dynamical changes in the transmembrane domains (TMDs), which is likely indicative of the formation of a chloride ion access path. This study suggests that the free energy gain from ATP binding acts as a driving force not only for NBD dimerization but also for NBD-TMD concerted motions. {\textcopyright} 2012 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {Template-based protein structure modeling is commonly used for protein structure prediction. Based on the observation that multiple template-based methods often perform better than single template-based methods, we further explore the use of a variable number of multiple templates for a given target in the latest variant of TASSER, TASSER(VMT) . We first develop an algorithm that improves the target-template alignment for a given template. The improved alignment, called the SP(3) alternative alignment, is generated by a parametric alignment method coupled with short TASSER refinement on models selected using knowledge-based scores. The refined top model is then structurally aligned to the template to produce the SP(3) alternative alignment. Templates identified using SP(3) threading are combined with the SP(3) alternative and HHEARCH alignments to provide target alignments to each template. These template models are then grouped into sets containing a variable number of template/alignment combinations. For each set, we run short TASSER simulations to build full-length models. Then, the models from all sets of templates are pooled, and the top 20-50 models selected using FTCOM ranking method. These models are then subjected to a single longer TASSER refinement run for final prediction. We benchmarked our method by comparison with our previously developed approach, pro-sp(3) -TASSER, on a set with 874 easy and 318 hard targets. The average GDT-TS score improvements for the first model are 3.5 and 4.3{\%} for easy and hard targets, respectively. When tested on the 112 CASP9 targets, our method improves the average GDT-TS scores as compared to pro-sp3-TASSER by 8.2 and 9.3{\%} for the 80 easy and 32 hard targets, respectively. It also shows slightly better results than the top ranked CASP9 Zhang-Server, QUARK and HHpredA methods. The program is available for download at http://cssb.biology.gatech.edu/.},

abstract = {The computational and conceptual simplifications realized by coarse-grain (CG) models make them a ubiquitous tool in the current computational modeling landscape. Building block based CG models, such as the Martini model, possess the key advantage of allowing for a broad range of applications without the need to reparametrize the force field each time. However, there are certain inherent limitations to this approach, which we investigate in detail in this work. We first study the consequences of the absence of specific cross Lennard-Jones parameters between different particle sizes. We show that this lack may lead to artificially high free energy barriers in dimerization profiles. We then look at the effect of deviating too far from the standard bonded parameters, both in terms of solute partitioning behavior and solvent properties. Moreover, we show that too weak bonded force constants entail the risk of artificially inducing clustering, which has to be taken into account when designing elastic network models for proteins. These results have implications for the current use of the Martini CG model and provide clear directions for the reparametrization of the Martini model. Moreover, our findings are generally relevant for the parametrization of any other building block based force field.},

Established molecular dynamics methodologies generally have not provided a way to calculate these properties without either a loss of thermodynamic rigor, the introduction of nonunique parameters, or a loss of information about which solute conformations specifically contributed to the output values. Here we implement a simple method that is thermodynamically rigorous and possesses none of the above disadvantages, and we report on the method's feasibility and computational demands. We calculate infinitely dilute partial molar properties for two proteins and attempt to distinguish the thermodynamic differences between a native and a denatured conformation of a designed miniprotein. We conclude that simple ensemble average properties can be calculated with very reasonable amounts of computational power. In contrast, properties corresponding to fluctuating quantities are computationally demanding to calculate precisely, although they can be obtained more easily by following the temperature and/or pressure dependence of the corresponding ensemble averages.

Critical to this function is the plasma membrane compartmentalization in lipid microdomains that control the localization and productive interactions of proteins involved in cell signal propagation. In addition, cells are divided into compartments limited by other membranes whose integrity and homeostasis are finely controlled, and which determine the identity and function of the different organelles. Here, we review current knowledge on membrane lipid composition in the plasma membrane and endomembrane compartments, emphasizing its role in sustaining organelle structure and function. The correct composition and structure of cell membranes define key pathophysiological aspects of cells. Therefore, we explore the therapeutic potential of manipulating membrane lipid composition with approaches like membrane lipid therapy, aiming to normalize cell functions through the modification of membrane lipid bilayers.},

abstract = {Previously we showed that the functional activity of the epithelial chloride channel that is encoded by the cystic fibrosis gene (CFTR) is reciprocally modulated by two components of the vesicle fusion machinery, syntaxin 1A and Munc-18. Here we report that syntaxin 1A inhibits CFTR chloride channels by means of direct and domain-specific protein-protein interactions. Syntaxin 1A stoichiometrically binds to the N-terminal cytoplasmic tail of CFTR, and this binding is blocked by Munc-18. The modulation of CFTR currents by syntaxin 1A is eliminated either by deletion of this tail or by injecting this tail as a blocking peptide into coexpressing Xenopus oocytes. The CFTR binding site on syntaxin 1A maps to the third predicted helical domain (H3) of this membrane protein. Moreover, CFTR Cl- currents are effectively inhibited by a minimal syntaxin 1A construct (i.e., the membrane-anchored H3 domain) that cannot fully substitute for wild-type syntaxin 1A in membrane fusion reactions. We also show that syntaxin 1A binds to and inhibits the activities of disease- associated mutants of CFTR, and that the chloride current activity of recombinant $\Delta$F508 CFTR (i.e., the most common cystic fibrosis mutant) can be potentiated by disrupting its interaction with syntaxin 1A in cultured epithelial cells. Our results provide evidence for a direct physical interaction between CFTR and syntaxin 1A that limits the functional activities of normal and disease-associated forms of this chloride channel.},

For the other DESs, adding pyridine increased the distribution ratio, and increasing the molar ratio of ethylene glycol increased the selectivity. Generally, whenever the selectivity increased, the distribution ratio decreased, and vice versa. The nonrandom two-liquid model was used to correlate the experimental data, and the average root mean square deviation (RMSD) between correlated and experimental tie lines was 1.4{\%}. Moreover, the Conductor-like Screening Model for Real Solvents was successfully used to predict the ternary tie lines for the studied systems with an average RMSD of 3.7{\%}.},

abstract = {Although molecular dynamics simulations have become a useful tool in essentially all fields of chemistry, condensed matter physics, materials science, and biology, there is still a large gap between the time scale which can be reached in molecular dynamics simulations and that observed in experiments. To address the problem, many enhanced sampling methods were introduced, which effectively extend the time scale being approached in simulations. In this perspective, we review a variety of enhanced sampling methods. We first discuss collective-variables-based methods including metadynamics and variationally enhanced sampling. Then, collective variable free methods such as parallel tempering and integrated tempering methods are presented. At last, we conclude with a brief introduction of some newly developed combinatory methods. We summarize in this perspective not only the theoretical background and numerical implementation of these methods but also the new challenges and prospects in the field of the enhanced sampling.},

abstract = {Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a life-limiting disease caused by mutations in the CFTR gene, which encodes an anion-selective channel. Because CF-causing mutations can affect CFTR gating as well as its biogenesis, multi-assay approaches have been implemented to sequentially screen for channel function and membrane density. Here we present the first assay capable of simultaneous assessment of both CFTR characteristics.To validate our assay, we investigate F508del-CFTR, the most common disease-causing CFTR mutant, confirming rescue by incubation at low temperature, treatment with corrector VX-809 and introduction of the second-site revertant mutation R1070W. Furthermore, we confirm a decrease in F508del-CFTR membrane density due to presence of potentiator VX-770 during VX-809 treatment. Finally, we characterize a panel of rare CF-causing mutations, confirming profiles obtained with Western blots and Ussing-chamber electrophysiology. We discuss how profiling effects of acute VX-770 treatment on the rare mutation panel can provide mechanistic insight on drug action.Because our assay quantifies simultaneously CFTR localization and function, it yields more accurate information on gating and permeation properties than can be inferred from separate measurements. By providing a two-dimensional molecular characterization of individual mutant CFTR proteins, our assay is a powerful tool for development of therapies truly addressing the root cause of each individual patient's cystic fibrosis disease.},

abstract = {Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is an ATP-gated anion channel with two remarkable distinctions. First, it is the only ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter that is known to be an ion channel-almost all others function as transport ATPases. Second, CFTR is the only ligand-gated channel that consumes its ligand (ATP) during the gating cycle-a consequence of its enzymatic activity as an ABC transporter. We discuss these special properties of CFTR in the context of its evolutionary history as an ABC transporter. Other topics include the mechanisms by which CFTR gating is regulated by phosphorylation of its unique regulatory domain and our current view of the CFTR permeation pathway (or pore). Understanding these basic operating principles of the CFTR channel is central to defining the mechanisms of action of prospective cystic fibrosis drugs and to the development of new, rational treatment strategies. {\textcopyright} 2013 Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press; all rights reserved.},

abstract = {We explore the consequences of very high dimensionality in the dynamical landscape of protein folding. Consideration of both typical range of stabilizing interactions, and folding rates themselves, leads to a model of the energy hypersurface that is characterized by the structure of diffusive "hypergutters" as well as the familiar "funnels". Several general predictions result: 1), intermediate subspaces of configurations will always be visited; 2), specific but nonnative interactions may be important in stabilizing these low-dimensional diffusive searches on the folding pathway, as well as native interactions; 3), sequential barriers will commonly be found, even in "two-state" proteins; 4), very early times will show characteristic departures from single-exponential kinetics; and 5), contributions of nonnative interactions to $\Phi$-values and "Chevron plots" are calculable, and may be significant. The example of a three-helix bundle is treated in more detail as an illustration. The model also shows that high-dimensional structures provide conceptual relations between different models of protein folding. It suggests that kinetic strategies for fast folding may be encoded rather generally in nonnative as well as in native interactions. The predictions are related to very recent findings in experiment and simulation.},

The highest-performing systems were found to capture CO2 at a capacity of ∼10{\%} by weight, equivalent to 2.3-2.4 mmol of CO2 captured per gram of DES sorbent. Of the superbases studied, 1,5-diazabicyclo[4.3.0]-non-5-ene (DBN) gave the best overall performance in terms of CO2 capture capacity, facility of release, and low sorbent cost. Interestingly, we found that only a fraction of the theoretical CO 2 capture potential of the system was utilized, offering potential pathways forward for further design and optimization of superbase-derived DES systems for further improved reversible CO2 sequestration. Finally, the shear rate-dependent viscosities indicate non-Newtonian behavior which, when coupled to the competitive CO2 capture performance of these task-specific DESs despite a 1 to 2 orders of magnitude higher viscosity, suggest that the Stokes-Einstein-Debye relation may not be a valid predictor of performance for these structurally and dynamically complex fluids. {\textcopyright} 2014 American Chemical Society.},

Quantum chemical calculations are employed to determine the binding energy of neutral and anionic urea to copper oxide and elemental copper, the main complexes believed to participate in surface cleaning of this DES. The possibility of the existence of urea anions in this deep eutectic solvent is studied in terms of the possibility of proton transfer taking place. Results show that the anion formation is stabilized in a dielectric and that the relative binding of neutral and anionic urea to copper oxide is similar whereas elemental Cu significantly favors binding with the urea anion. This work also shows that the hydrogen bond interactions of the urea with the chloride ion maintains an open cluster structure as suggested by experiment and that proton transfer can occur with increasing temperature or with metallic complex formation leading to more aggressive solvent action. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

CFTR opening rate, unusually slow because of its high-energy transition state, is further slowed by CF mutation $\Delta$F508. Here, we exploit equilibrium gating of hydrolysis-deficient CFTR mutant D1370N and apply rate-equilibrium free-energy relationship analysis to estimate relative timing of opening movements in distinct protein regions. We find clear directionality of motion along the longitudinal protein axis and identify an opening transition-state structure with the NBD dimer formed but the pore still closed. Thus, strain at the NBD/pore-domain interface, the $\Delta$F508 mutation locus, underlies the energetic barrier for opening. Our findings suggest a therapeutic opportunity to stabilize this transition-state structure pharmacologically in $\Delta$F508-CFTR to correct its opening defect, an essential step toward restoring CFTR function.},

Phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic regulatory (R) domain by protein kinase A activates CFTR by an unknown mechanism. The amino-terminal cytoplasmic tail of CFTR was found to control protein kinase A-dependent channel gating through a physical interaction with the R domain. This regulatory activity mapped to a cluster of acidic residues in the NH2-terminal tail; mutating these residues proportionately inhibited R domain binding and CFTR channel function. CFTR activity appears to be governed by an interdomain interaction involving the amino-terminal tail which is a potential target for physiologic and pharmacologic modulators of this ion channel.},

It is based on the premise that K+ ions maintain a complete hydration shell while passing between the transmembrane cavity and cytosol, which must be accommodated. To put the canonical model to the test, we locked the conformation of a Kir K+ channel to prevent widening of the narrow collar. Unexpectedly, conduction was unimpaired in the locked channels. In parallel, we employed all-atom molecular dynamics to simulate K+ ions moving along the conduction pathway between the lower cavity and cytosol. During simulations, the constriction did not significantly widen. Instead, transient loss of some water molecules facilitated K+ permeation through the collar. The low free energy barrier to partial dehydration in the absence of conformational change indicates Kir channels are not gated by the canonical mechanism.},

abstract = {In absence of experimental 3D structures, several homology models, based on ABC exporter 3D structures, have provided significant insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the function of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein, a chloride channel whose defects are associated with cystic fibrosis (CF). Until now, these models, however, did not furnished much insights into the continuous way that ions could follow from the cytosol to the extracellular milieu in the open form of the channel. Here, we have built a refined model of CFTR, based on the outward-facing Sav1866 experimental 3D structure and integrating the evolutionary and structural information available today. Molecular dynamics simulations revealed significant conformational changes, resulting in a full-open channel, accessible from the cytosol through lateral tunnels displayed in the long intracellular loops (ICLs). At the same time, the region of nucleotide-binding domain 1 in contact with one of the ICLs and carrying amino acid F508, the deletion of which is the most common CF-causing mutation, was found to adopt an alternative but stable position. Then, in a second step, this first stable full-open conformation evolved toward another stable state, in which only a limited displacement of the upper part of the transmembrane helices leads to a closure of the channel, in a conformation very close to that adopted by the Atm1 ABC exporter, in an inward-facing conformation. These models, supported by experimental data, provide significant new insights into the CFTR structure-function relationships and into the possible impact of CF-causing mutations.},

It was assumed, however, that some represented atypical clinical forms of EBV infection and that timing of specimen collection was a factor in explaining the paucity of Downey cells.

abstract = {Accurate methods to estimate free energies play an important role for studying diverse condensed-phase problems in chemistry and biochemistry. The most common methods used in conjunction with molecular dynamics (MD) and Monte Carlo statistical mechanics (MC) simulations are free energy perturbation (FEP) and thermodynamic integration (TI). For common applications featuring the conversion of one molecule to another, simulations are run in stages or multiple "$\lambda$-windows" to promote convergence of the results. For computation of absolute free energies of solvation or binding, calculations are needed in which the solute is typically annihilated in the solvent and in the complex. The present work addresses identification of optimal protocols for such calculations, specifically, the creation/annihilation of organic molecules in aqueous solution. As is common practice, decoupling of the perturbations for electrostatic and Lennard-Jones interactions was performed. Consistent with earlier reports, FEP calculations for molecular creations are much more efficient, while annihilations require many more windows and may converge to incorrect values. Strikingly, we find that as few as four windows may be adequate for creation calculations for solutes ranging from argon to ethylbenzene. For a larger druglike molecule, MIF180, which contains 22 non-hydrogen atoms and three rotatable bonds, 10 creation windows are found to be adequate to yield the correct free energy of hydration. Convergence is impeded with procedures that use any sampling in the annihilation direction, and there is no need for postprocessing methods such as the Bennett acceptance ratio (BAR).},

abstract = {Background: N1303K, one of the common, severe disease-causing mutations in the CFTR gene, causes both defective biogenesis and gating abnormalities of the CFTR protein. The goals of the present study are to quantitatively assess the gating defects associated with the N1303K mutation and its pharmacological response to CFTR modulators including potentiators VX-770 and GLPG1837 and correctors VX-809, and VX-661. Methods: Gating behavior and pharmacological responses to CFTR potentiators were assessed using patch-clamp technique in the excised, inside-out mode. We also examined the effects of GLPG1837, VX-770, VX-809 and VX-661 on N1303K-CFTR surface expression using Western blot analysis. Results: Like wild-type (WT) CFTR, N1303K-CFTR channels were activated by protein kinase A-dependent phosphorylation, but the open probability (Po) of phosphorylated N1303K-CFTR was extremely low ({\~{}}0.03 vs {\~{}}0.45 in WT channels). N1303K mutants showed abnormal responses to ATP analogs or mutations that disrupt ATP hydrolysis and/or dimerization of CFTR's two nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs). However, the Po of N1303K-CFTR was dramatically increased by GLPG1837 ({\~{}}17-fold) and VX-770 ({\~{}}8-fold). VX-809 or VX-661 enhanced N1303K-CFTR maturation by 2–3 fold, and co-treatment with GLPG1837 or VX-770 did not show any negative drug-drug interaction. Conclusion: N1303K has a severe gating defect, reduced ATP-dependence and aberrant response to ATP analogs. These results suggest a defective function of the NBDs in N1303K-CFTR. An improvement of channel function by GLPG1837 or VX-770 and an increase of Band C protein by VX-809 or VX-661 support a therapeutic strategy of combining CFTR potentiator and corrector for patients carrying the N1303K mutation.},

abstract = {The quantitative experimental uncertainty in the structure of fully hydrated, biologically relevant, fluid (L($\alpha$)) phase lipid bilayers has been too large to provide a firm base for applications or for comparison with simulations. Many structural methods are reviewed including modern liquid crystallography of lipid bilayers that deals with the fully developed undulation fluctuations that occur in the L($\alpha$) phase. These fluctuations degrade the higher order diffraction data in a way that, if unrecognized, leads to erroneous conclusions regarding bilayer structure. Diffraction measurements at high instrumental resolution provide a measure of these fluctuations. In addition to providing better structural determination, this opens a new window on interactions between bilayers, so the experimental determination of interbilayer interaction parameters is reviewed briefly. We introduce a new structural correction based on fluctuations that has not been included in any previous studies. Updated measurements, such as for the area compressibility modulus, are used to provide adjustments to many of the literature values of structural quantities. Since the gel (L($\beta$)') phase is valuable as a stepping stone for obtaining fluid phase results, a brief review is given of the lower temperature phases. The uncertainty in structural results for lipid bilayers is being reduced and best current values are provided for bilayers of five lipids. Copyright (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.},

Here, we delineate global changes in adipocyte signalling networks following acute oxidative stress and reveal considerable crosstalk between cysteine oxidation and phosphorylation-based signalling. Oxidation of key regulatory kinases, including Akt, mTOR and AMPK influences the fidelity rather than their absolute activation state, highlighting an unappreciated interplay between these modifications. Mechanistic analysis of the redox regulation of Akt identified two cysteine residues in the pleckstrin homology domain (C60 and C77) to be reversibly oxidized. Oxidation at these sites affected Akt recruitment to the plasma membrane by stabilizing the PIP3 binding pocket. Our data provide insights into the interplay between oxidative stress-derived redox signalling and protein phosphorylation networks and serve as a resource for understanding the contribution of cellular oxidation to a range of diseases.},

abstract = {We describe a comparative protein modelling method designed to find the most probable structure for a sequence given its alignment with related structures. The three-dimensional (3D) model is obtained by optimally satisfying spatial restraints derived from the alignment and expressed as probability density functions (pdfs) for the features restrained. For example, the probabilities for main-chain conformations of a modelled residue may be restrained by its residue type, main-chain conformation of an equivalent residue in a related protein, and the local similarity between the two sequences. Several such pdfs are obtained from the correlations between structural features in 17 families of homologous proteins which have been aligned on the basis of their 3D structures. The pdfs restrain C$\alpha$-C$\alpha$ distances, main-chain N-O distances, main-chain and side-chain dihedral angles. A smoothing procedure is used in the derivation of these relationships to minimize the problem of a sparse database. The 3D model of a protein is obtained by optimization of the molecular pdf such that the model violates the input restraints as little as possible. The molecular pdf is derived as a combination of pdfs restraining individual spatial features of the whole molecule. The optimization procedure is a variable target function method that applies the conjugate gradients algorithm to positions of all non-hydrogen atoms. The method is automated and is illustrated by the modelling of trypsin from two other serine proteinases. {\textcopyright} 1993 Academic Press Limited.},

abstract = {Developing and characterizing green solvents with low toxicity and cost is one of the most important issues in chemistry. Deep Eutectic Solvents (DESs), in this regard, have shown tremendous promise. Compared to popular organic solvents, DESs possess negligible VOCs and are non-flammable. Compared to ionic liquids, which share many characteristics but are ionic compounds and not ionic mixtures, DESs are cheaper to make, much less toxic and mostly biodegradable. An estimate of the polarity associated with DESs is essential if they are to be used as green alternatives to common organic solvents in industries and academia. As no one physical parameter can satisfactorily represent solute-solvent interactions within a medium, polarity of DESs is assessed through solvatochromic optical spectroscopic responses of several UV-vis absorbance and molecular fluorescence probes. Information on the local microenvironment (i.e., the cybotactic region) that surrounds several solvatochromic probes [betaine dye, pyrene, pyrene-1-carboxaldehyde, 1-anilino-8-naphthalene sulfonate (ANS), p-toluidinyl-6-naphthalene sulfonate (TNS), 6-propionyl-2-(dimethylaminonaphthalene) (PRODAN), coumarin-153, and Nile Red] for four common and popular DESs formed from choline chloride combined with 1,2-ethanediol, glycerol, urea, and malonic acid, respectively, in 1 : 2 molar ratios termed ethaline, glyceline, reline, and maline is obtained and used to assess the effective polarity afforded by each of these DESs. The four DESs as indicated by these probe responses are found to be fairly dipolar in nature. Absorbance probe betaine dye and fluorescence probes ANS, TNS, PRODAN, coumarin-153, and Nile Red, whose solvatochromic responses are based on photoinduced charge-transfer, imply ethaline and glyceline, DESs formed using alcohol-based H-bond donors, to be relatively more dipolar in nature as compared to reline and maline. The pyrene polarity scale, which is based on polarity-induced changes in vibronic bands, indicates reline, the DES composed of urea as the hydrogen bond donor, to be significantly more dipolar than the other three DESs. Response of pyrene-1-carboxaldehyde, a polarity probe based on inversion of n-$\pi$* and $\pi$-$\pi$* states, hints at maline to be the most dipolar of the four DESs. The molecular structure of the H-bond donor in a DES clearly controls the dipolarity afforded by the DES. H-bonding and other specific solute-solvent interactions are found to play an important role in solvatochromic probe behavior for the four DESs. The cybotactic region of a probe dissolved in a DES affords information on the polarity of the DES towards solutes of similar nature and functionality.},

abstract = {The cystic fibrosis (CF) transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) bears six extracellular loops (ECL1-6); ECL1 is the site of several mutations associated with CF. Mutation R117H has been reported to reduce current amplitude, whereas D110H, E116K, and R117C/L/P may impair channel stability. We hypothesized that these amino acids might not be directly involved in ion conduction and permeation but may contribute to stabilizing the outer vestibule architecture in CFTR. We used cRNA injected oocytes combined with electrophysiological techniques to test this hypothesis. Mutants bearing cysteine at these sites were not functionally modified by extracellular MTS reagents and were blocked by GlyH-101 similarly to WT-CFTR. These results suggest that these three residues do not contribute directly to permeation in CFTR. In contrast, mutants D110R-, E116R-, and R117A-CFTR exhibited instability of the open state and significantly shortened burst duration compared with WT-CFTR and failed to be locked into the open state by AMP-PNP (adenosine 5'-({\ss},$\gamma$-imido) triphosphate); charge-retaining mutants showed mainly the full open state with comparably longer open burst duration. These interactions suggest that these ECL1 residues might be involved in maintaining the outer pore architecture of CFTR. A CFTR homology model suggested that E116 interacts with R104 in both the closed and open states, D110 interacts with K892 in the fully closed state, and R117 interacts with E1126 in the open state. These interactions were confirmed experimentally. The results suggest that D110, E116, and R117 may contribute to stabilizing the architecture of the outer pore of CFTR by interactions with other charged residues. {\textcopyright} 2014 Cui et al.},

The primal solution is a choline chloride (ChCl)-urea mixture-based ionic liquid with nickel chloride hexahydrate (NiCl{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}{\textperiodcentered}6H{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}O) dissolved. The proposed ionothermal protocol is attractive and environmental friendly because ChCl and urea are naturally biocompatible compounds. It has been reported that Ni(NH{\textless}inf{\textgreater}3{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}){\textless}inf{\textgreater}6{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}Cl{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} is an indirect and reversible hydrogen storage material for fuel cells.

Interestingly, with the addition of a small amount of water into the primal solution which has been kept at 150 °C and open to the air for 40 minutes, NF $\alpha$-Ni(OH){\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} can be obtained. Further annealing of the NF $\alpha$-Ni(OH){\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} at 300 °C leads to the formation of NF-NiO with a mesoporous structure, which is demonstrated to be a promising pseudo-capacitive electrode material in a KOH aqueous solution. The rapid activation process, good cycling performance, and high specific capacitance of the NF-NiO electrode are attributed to its high surface area (72.9 m{\textless}sup{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} g{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}) and the mesoporous structure.

abstract = {Enhancing sampling and analyzing simulations are central issues in molecular simulation. Recently, we introduced PLUMED, an open-source plug-in that provides some of the most popular molecular dynamics (MD) codes with implementations of a variety of different enhanced sampling algorithms and collective variables (CVs). The rapid changes in this field, in particular new directions in enhanced sampling and dimensionality reduction together with new hardware, require a code that is more flexible and more efficient. We therefore present PLUMED 2 here - a complete rewrite of the code in an object-oriented programming language (C++). This new version introduces greater flexibility and greater modularity, which both extends its core capabilities and makes it far easier to add new methods and CVs. It also has a simpler interface with the MD engines and provides a single software library containing both tools and core facilities. Ultimately, the new code better serves the ever-growing community of users and contributors in coping with the new challenges arising in the field. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The most common cause of cystic fibrosis (CF) is deletion of phenylalanine 508 ($\Delta$F508) in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) chloride channel. The $\Delta$F508 mutation produces defects in folding, stability, and channel gating. To identify small-molecule correctors of defective cellular processing, we assayed iodide flux in $\Delta$F508-CFTR-transfected epithelial cells using a fluorescent halide indicator. Screening of 150,000 chemically diverse compounds and more than 1,500 analogs of active compounds yielded several classes of $\Delta$F508-CFTR correctors (aminoarylthiazoles, quinazolinylaminopyrimidinones, and bisaminomethylbithiazoles) with micromolar potency that produced greater apical membrane chloride current than did low-temperature rescue. Correction was seen within 3-6 hours and persisted for more than 12 hours after washout. Functional correction was correlated with plasma membrane expression of complex-glycosylated $\Delta$F508-CFTR protein. Biochemical studies suggested a mechanism of action involving improved $\Delta$F508-CFTR folding at the ER and stability at the cell surface. The bisaminomethylbithiazoles corrected $\Delta$F508-CFTR in $\Delta$F508/$\Delta$F508 human bronchial epithelia but did not correct a different temperature-sensitive CFTR mutant (P574H-CFTR) or a dopamine receptor mutant. Small-molecule correctors maybe useful in the treatment of CF caused by the $\Delta$F508 mutation.},

Here, we present experimental measurements of binding energies for water molecules occupying the second and, quite possibly, the third solvation shell surrounding a central Ca2+ ion in [Ca(H2O)n]2+ complexes. Results for these large, previously inaccessible, complexes have come from the application of finite heat bath theory to kinetic energy measurements following unimolecular decay. Even at n=20, the results show water molecules to be more strongly bound to Ca2+ than would be expected just from the presence of an extended network of hydrogen bonds. For n{\textgreater}10, there is very good agreement between the experimental binding energies and recently published density functional theory calculations. Comparisons are made with similar data recorded for [Ca(NH3)n]2+ and [Ca(CH3OH)n]2+ complexes.},

abstract = {THE cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is a phosphorylation-regulated Cl- channel located in the apical membrane of epithelia1-10. Although cystic fibrosis (CF) is caused by mutations in a single gene encoding CFTR11,12, the disease has a variable clinical phenotype13,14. The most common mutation associated with cystic fibrosis, deletion of a phenylalanine at position 508 (frequency, 67{\%}), is associated with severe disease15-17. But some missense mutations, for example ones in which arginine is replaced by histidine at residue at 117 (R117H; 0.8{\%}), tryptophan at 334 (0.4{\%}), or proline at 347 (0.5{\%}), are associated with milder disease15,17,18. These missense mutations affect basic residues located at the external end of the second (M2) and in the sixth (M6) putative membrane-spanning sequences. Here we report that, when expressed in heterologous epithelial cells, all three mutants were correctly processed and generated cyclic AMP-regulated apical Cl- currents. Although the macroscopic current properties were normal, the amount of current was reduced. Patch-clamp analysis revealed that all three mutants had reduced single-channel conductances. In addition, R117H showed altered sensitivity to external pH and had altered single-channel kinetics. These results explain the quantitative decrease in macroscopic Cl- current, and suggest that R117, R334 and R347 contribute to the pore of the CFTR Cl - channel. Our results also suggest why R117H, R334W and R347P produce less severe clinical disease and have implications for our understanding of cystic fibrosis. {\textcopyright} 1993 Nature Publishing Group.},

abstract = {Choline-chloride based deep eutectic solvents (DES) have been used for several different applications (e.g., solubility, electrochemistry, and purifications) due to their relative inexpensive and readily available nature. In this work, three choline chloride-based DESs are simulated using molecular dynamics to study the hydrogen bonding interactions of the system. Three hydrogen bond donors (HBD) are studied in order to determine the changes in the hydrogen bonding interactions when the HBD is different in the DES. One dicarboxylic acid and two polyols (with different number of OH groups) were chosen as the HBDs of interest. First, the simulations are validated by comparing simulated and experimental thermodynamic and transport properties, when possible. Then, for maline (choline chloride/malonic acid), the more anomalous system studied here, molecular simulations complement results obtained from an FTIR spectroscopic study in order to further understand this unique system. Good agreement with experimental values was obtained for simulated density, heat capacity, and transport properties. A high relative percent of hydrogen bonding is observed for interactions between the anion and the HBD for the three main systems studied here, consistent with the nature of how these moieties interact in DESs. Comparison is also done with a previous DES studied in our group. From the infrared spectroscopic study conducted on maline films, band assignments were discussed highlighting a "free" carbonyl group of the carboxylic acid group in the eutectic mixture when the OH group is hydrogen bonded to something else. Additionally, a band is assigned to a hydrogen bonded carbonyl group. These band assignments are consistent with findings in the molecular simulations and highlight the predominant interactions of the system.},

These DESs capture CO2via carbamate formation upon reaction between their hydrogen bonding donor units and CO2. Among the members tested herein, a DES made up of monoethanolamine hydrochloride-ethylenediamine exhibits an unprecedentedly high gravimetric uptake of 33.7 wt{\%} with good initial kinetics (25.2 wt{\%} uptake within 2.5 min) and recyclability. The given DES also shows sustainable performance in the presence of water, decent tolerance against temperature rise, and a relatively low heat of absorption which is attractive for regeneration. Even with the high gravimetric uptake, the DES has a far more suppressed corrosiveness compared to its pure monoethanolamine and ethylenediamine counterparts due to low oxygen/moisture permeability and the hydrogen bonding network that alleviates the corrosion redox cycle. The observed excellent properties in various key aspects of CO2 capture suggest that DESs are strong candidates to replace the conventional monoethanolamine-based scrubbing technology and are worth further exploration.},

abstract = {Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), involved in cystic fibrosis (CF), is a chloride channel belonging to the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) superfamily. Using the experimental structure of Sav1866 as template, we previously modeled the human CFTR structure, including membrane-spanning domains (MSD) and nucleotide-binding domains (NBD), in an outward-facing conformation (open channel state). Here, we constructed a model of the CFTR inward-facing conformation (closed channel) on the basis of the recent corrected structures of MsbA and compared the structural features of those two states of the channel. Interestingly, the MSD:NBD coupling interfaces including F508 ($\Delta$F508 being the most common CF mutation) are mainly left unchanged. This prediction, completed by the modeling of the regulatory R domain, is supported by experimental data and provides a molecular basis for a better understanding of the functioning of CFTR, especially of the structural features that make CFTR the unique channel among the ABC transporters. {\textcopyright} 2009 Birkh{\"{a}}user Verlag, Basel/Switzerland.},

We tested different water contents in these ILs at room temperature (298 K) and high temperature (343 K), and we observe that the enzyme structure is highly dependent on the amount of water present in the IL media. We show that the enzyme is preferentially stabilized in [BMIM][PF6] at 5-10{\%} (w/w) (weight of water over protein) water content at room temperature. [BMIM][PF 6] renders a more nativelike enzyme structure at the same water content of 5-10{\%} (w/w) as previously found for hexane, and the system displays a similar bell-shape-like dependence with the water content in the IL media. [BMIM][PF6] is shown to increase significantly the protein thermostability at high temperatures, especially at low hydration. Our analysis indicates that the enzyme is less stabilized in [BMIM]-[NO3] relative to [BMIM][PF6] at both temperatures, most likely due to the strong affinity of the [NO3]- anion toward the protein main chain. These findings are in accordance with the experimental knowledge for these two ionic liquids. We also show that these ILs "strip off" most of the water from the enzyme surface in a degree similar to that found for polar organic solvents such as acetonitrile, and that the remaining waters at the enzyme surface are organized in many small clusters. {\textcopyright} 2008 American Chemical Society.},

We demonstrate that Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection increases endoplasmic reticulum–mitochondria associations in cystic fibrosis bronchial cells by stabilizing VAPB-PTPIP51 (vesicle-associated membrane protein–associated protein B–protein tyrosine phosphatase interacting protein 51) tethers, affecting autophagy. Impaired autophagy induced mitochondrial unfolding protein response and NLRP3 inflammasome activation, contributing to hyperinflammation. The mechanism by which VAPB-PTPIP51 tethers regulate autophagy in cystic fibrosis involves calcium transfer via mitochondrial calcium uniporter.

abstract = {More than 2000 mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) have been described that confer a range of molecular cell biological and functional phenotypes. Most of these mutations lead to compromised anion conductance at the apical plasma membrane of secretory epithelia and cause cystic fibrosis (CF) with variable disease severity. Based on the molecular phenotypic complexity of CFTR mutants and their susceptibility to pharmacotherapy, it has been recognized that mutations may impose combinatorial defects in CFTR channel biology. This notion led to the conclusion that the combination of pharmacotherapies addressing single defects (e.g., transcription, translation, folding, and/or gating) may show improved clinical benefit over available low-efficacy monotherapies. Indeed, recent phase 3 clinical trials combining ivacaftor (a gating potentiator) and lumacaftor (a folding corrector) have proven efficacious in CF patients harboring the most common mutation (deletion of residue F508, $\delta$F508, or Phe508del). This drug combination was recently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for patients homozygous for $\delta$F508. Emerging studies of the structural, cell biological, and functional defects caused by rare mutations provide a new framework that reveals a mixture of deficiencies in different CFTR alleles. Establishment of a set of combinatorial categories of the previously defined basic defects in CF alleles will aid the design of even more efficacious therapeutic interventions for CF patients.},

Whereas established therapies for the treatment of cystic fibrosis target CFTR to repair its function, alternative therapeutic strategies aim for the restoration of chloride transport by the activation of other chloride transport proteins such as TMEM16A or SLC26A9 or by the application of synthetic anionophores. TMEM16A is an anion-selective channel that is activated by the binding of Ca2+ from the cytoplasm. Pharmacological efforts aim for the increase of its open probability at resting Ca2+ concentrations. SLC26 is an uncoupled chloride transporter, which shuttles chloride across the membrane by an alternate-access mechanism. Its activation requires its mobilization from intracellular stores. Finally, anionophores are small synthetic molecules that bind chloride to form lipid-soluble complexes, which shuttle the anion across the membrane. All three approaches are currently pursued and have provided promising initial results.},

Questions persist about its clinical utility because of high cost and modest efficacy. OBJECTIVES To examine the efficacy of riluzole in prolonging survival and in delaying the use of surrogates (tracheostomy and mechanical ventilation) to sustain survival, and to assess the effect of riluzole upon functional health. SEARCH METHODS We searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Specialized Register (20 April 2011), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2011, Issue 2), MEDLINE (1966 to April 2011), EMBASE (1980 to May 2011) and made enquiries of authors of trials, Aventis (manufacturer of riluzole) and other experts in the field. SELECTION CRITERIA Types of studies: randomized controlled trials TYPES OF PARTICIPANTS adults with a diagnosis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis Types of interventions: treatment with riluzole or placebo Types of outcome measures: Primary: pooled hazard ratio of tracheostomy-free survival over all time points with riluzole 100 mg. Secondary: per cent mortality with riluzole 50 mg, 100 mg and 200 mg; neurologic function, muscle strength and adverse events. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS One author performed data extraction and two other authors checked them. One author checked the data and entered them into the computer. The other authors verified the data entry. We obtained missing data from the trial authors whenever possible. MAIN RESULTS The four trials examining tracheostomy-free survival included a total of 974 riluzole-treated patients and 503 placebo-treated patients. No new randomized controlled trials were found when we updated the searches for this update in 2011. The methodological quality was acceptable and three trials were easily comparable, although one trial (169 participants) included older patients in more advanced stages of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and one (195 participants) had multiple primary endpoints. Riluzole 100 mg per day provided a benefit for the homogeneous group of patients in the first two trials (hazard ratio (HR) 0.80, 95{\%} confidence internal (CI) 0.64 to 0.99, P= 0.042) and there was no evidence of heterogeneity (P = 0.33). When the third trial (which included older and more seriously affected patients) was added, there was evidence of heterogeneity (P {\textless} 0.0001) and the overall treatment effect was reduced but still significant (HR 0.84, 95{\%} CI 0.698 to 0.997, P= 0.046). This represented a 9{\%} gain in the probability of surviving one year (49{\%} in the placebo and 58{\%} in the riluzole group), and increased median survival from 11.8 to 14.8 months. There was a small beneficial effect on both bulbar and limb function, but not on muscle strength. A three-fold increase in serum alanine transferase was more frequent in riluzole-treated patients than controls (mean difference 2.62, 95{\%} CI 1.59 to 4.31). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS Riluzole 100 mg daily is reasonably safe and probably prolongs median survival by about two to three months in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.},

abstract = {Potassium ion channels form pores in cell membranes, allowing potassium ions through while preventing the passage of sodium ions. Despite numerous high-resolution structures, it is not yet possible to relate their structure to their single molecule function other than at a qualitative level. Over the past decade, there has been a concerted effort using molecular dynamics to capture the thermodynamics and kinetics of conduction by calculating potentials of mean force (PMF). These can be used, in conjunction with the electro-diffusion theory, to predict the conductance of a specific ion channel. Here, we calculate seven independent PMFs, thereby studying the differences between two potassium ion channels, the effect of the CHARMM CMAP forcefield correction, and the sensitivity and reproducibility of the method. Thermodynamically stable ion-water configurations of the selectivity filter can be identified from all the free energy landscapes, but the heights of the kinetic barriers for potassium ions to move through the selectivity filter are, in nearly all cases, too high to predict conductances in line with experiment. This implies it is not currently feasible to predict the conductance of potassium ion channels, but other simpler channels may be more tractable. {\textcopyright} 2013 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {Metadynamics (MTD) is one of the most effective methods for calculating the free energy surface and finding rare events. Nevertheless, numerous studies using MTD have been carried out using 3D or lower dimensional collective variables (CVs), as higher dimensional CVs require costly computational resources and the obtained results are too complex to understand the important events. The latter issue can be conveniently solved by utilizing the free energy reaction network (FERN), which is a graph structure consisting of edges of minimum free energy paths (MFEPs), nodes of equation (EQ) points, and transition state (TS) points. In the present article, a new method for exploring FERNs on high-dimensional CVs using MTD and the scaled hypersphere search (SHS) method is described. A test calculation based on the MTD-SHS simulation of met-enkephalin in explicit water with 7 CVs was conducted. As a result, 889 EQ points and 1805 TS points were found. The MTD-SHS approach can find MFEPs exhaustively; therefore, the FERNs can be estimated without any a priori knowledge of the EQ and TS points.},

abstract = {The challenges associated with synthesizing porous materials mean that new classes of zeolites (zeotypes)-such as alumino-silicate zeolites, and zeolite analogues-together with new methods of preparing known zeotypes, continue to be of great importance. Normally these materials are prepared hydrothermally with water as the solvent in a sealed autodave under autogenous pressure. The reaction mixture usually includes an organic template or structure-directing agent' that guides the synthesis pathway towards particular structures. Here we report the preparation of aluminophosphate zeolite analogues by using ionic liquids and eutectic mixtures. An imidazolium-based ionic liquid acts as both solvent and template, leading to four zeotype frameworks under different experimental conditions. The structural characteristics of the materials can be traced back to the solvent chemistry used. Because of the vanishingly low vapour pressure of ionic liquids, synthesis takes place at ambient pressure, eliminating safety concerns associated with high hydrothermal pressures. The ionic liquid can also be recycled for further use. A choline chloride/urea eutectic mixtures is also used in the preparation of a new zeotype framework.},

abstract = {The $\Delta$F508 mutation in nucleotide-binding domain 1 (NBD1) of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is the predominant cause of cystic fibrosis. Previous biophysical studies on human F508 and $\Delta$F508 domains showed only local structural changes restricted to residues 509-511 and only minor differences in folding rate and stability. These results were remarkable because $\Delta$F508 was widely assumed to perturb domain folding based on the fact that it prevents trafficking of CFTR out of the endoplasmic reticulum. However, the previously reported crystal structures did not come from matched F508 and $\Delta$F508 constructs, and the $\Delta$F508 structure contained additional mutations that were required to obtain sufficient protein solubility. In this article, we present additional biophysical studies of NBD1 designed to address these ambiguities. Mass spectral measurements of backbone amide 1H/2H exchange rates in matched F508 and $\Delta$F508 constructs reveal that $\Delta$F508 increases backbone dynamics at residues 509-511 and the adjacent protein segments but not elsewhere in NBD1. These measurements also confirm a high level of flexibility in the protein segments exhibiting variable conformations in the crystal structures. We additionally present crystal structures of a broader set of human NBD1 constructs, including one harboring the native F508 residue and others harboring the $\Delta$F508 mutation in the presence of fewer and different solubilizing mutations. The only consistent conformational difference is observed at residues 509-511. The side chain of residue V510 in this loop is mostly buried in all non-$\Delta$F508 structures but completely solvent exposed in all $\Delta$F508 structures. These results reinforce the importance of the perturbation $\Delta$F508 causes in the surface topography of NBD1 in a region likely to mediate contact with the transmembrane domains of CFTR. However, they also suggest that increased exposure of the 509-511 loop and increased dynamics in its vicinity could promote aggregation in vitro and aberrant intermolecular interactions that impede trafficking in vivo. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {During neurodegenerative disease, the multifunctional RNA-binding protein TDP-43 undergoes a vast array of post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, acetylation, and cleavage. Many of these alterations may directly contribute to the pathogenesis of TDP-43 proteinopathies, which include most forms of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and approximately half of all frontotemporal dementia, pathologically identified as frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) with TDP-43 pathology. However, the relative contributions of the various TDP-43 post-translational modifications to disease remain unclear, and indeed some may be secondary epiphenomena rather than disease-causative. It is therefore critical to determine the involvement of each modification in disease processes to allow the design of targeted treatments. In particular, TDP-43 C-terminal fragments (CTFs) accumulate in the brains of people with ALS and FTLD and are therefore described as a neuropathological signature of these diseases. Remarkably, these TDP-43 CTFs are rarely observed in the spinal cord, even in ALS which involves dramatic degeneration of spinal motor neurons. Therefore, TDP-43 CTFs are not produced non-specifically in the course of all forms of TDP-43-related neurodegeneration, but rather variably arise due to additional factors influenced by regional heterogeneity in the central nervous system. In this review, we summarize how TDP-43 CTFs are generated and degraded by cells, and critique evidence from studies of TDP-43 CTF pathology in human disease tissues, as well as cell and animal models, to analyze the pathophysiological relevance of TDP-43 CTFs to ALS and FTLD. Numerous studies now indicate that, although TDP-43 CTFs are prevalent in ALS and FTLD brains, disease-related pathology is only variably reproduced in TDP-43 CTF cell culture models. Furthermore, TDP-43 CTF expression in both transgenic and viral-mediated in vivo models largely fails to induce motor or behavioral dysfunction reminiscent of human disease. We therefore conclude that although TDP-43 CTFs are a hallmark of TDP-43-related neurodegeneration in the brain, they are not a primary cause of ALS or FTLD.},

abstract = {The Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (CFTR) is an ABC transporter containing two transmembrane domains forming a chloride ion channel, and two nucleotide binding domains (NBD1 and NBD2). CFTR has presented a formidable challenge to obtain monodisperse, biophysically stable protein. Here we report a comprehensive study comparing effects of single and multiple NBD1 mutations on stability of both the NBD1 domain alone and on purified full length human CFTR. Single mutations S492P, A534P, I539T acted additively, and when combined with M470V, S495P, and R555K cumulatively yielded an NBD1 with highly improved structural stability. Strategic combinations of these mutations strongly stabilized the domain to attain a calorimetric Tm {\textgreater} 70 °C. Replica exchange molecular dynamics simulations on the most stable 6SS-NBD1 variant implicated fluctuations, electrostatic interactions and side chain packing as potential contributors to improved stability. Progressive stabilization of NBD1 directly correlated with enhanced structural stability of full-length CFTR protein. Thermal unfolding of the stabilized CFTR mutants, monitored by changes in intrinsic fluorescence, demonstrated that Tm could be shifted as high as 67.4 °C in 6SS-CFTR, more than 20 °C higher than wild-type. H1402S, an NBD2 mutation, conferred CFTR with additional thermal stability, possibly by stabilizing an NBD-dimerized conformation. CFTR variants with NBD1-stabilizing mutations were expressed at the cell surface in mammalian cells, exhibited ATPase and channel activity, and retained these functions to higher temperatures. The capability to produce enzymatically active CFTR with improved structural stability amenable to biophysical and structural studies will advance mechanistic investigations and future cystic fibrosis drug development.},

abstract = {Polarization of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), a cAMP-activated chloride channel, to the apical plasma membrane of epithelial cells is critical for vectorial transport of chloride in a variety of epithelia, including the airway, pancreas, intestine, and kidney. However, the motifs that localize CFTR to the apical membrane are unknown. We report that the last 3 amino acids in the COOH-terminus of CFTR (T-R-L) comprise a PDZ-interacting domain that is required for the polarization of CFTR to the apical plasma membrane in human airway and kidney epithelial cells. In addition, the CFTR mutant, S1455X, which lacks the 26 COOH-terminal amino acids, including the PDZ-interacting domain, is mispolarized to the lateral membrane. We also demonstrate that CFTR binds to ezrin-radixin-moesin-binding phosphoprotein 50 (EBP50), an apical membrane PDZ domain containing protein. We propose that COOH-terminal deletions of CFTR, which represent about 10{\%} of CFTR mutations, result in defective vectorial chloride transport, partly by altering the polarized distribution of CFTR in epithelial cells. Moreover, our data demonstrate that PDZ-interacting domains and PDZ domain-containing proteins play a key role in the apical polarization of ion channels in epithelial cells.},

VX-770 potentiated wildtype CFTR and several disease mutants expressed in oocytes in a manner modulated by PKA-mediated phosphorylation. Potentiation of some other mutants, including G551D-CFTR, was less dependent upon the level of phosphorylation, likely related to the severe gating defects in these mutants exhibited in part by a shift in PKA sensitivity to activation, possibly due to an electrostatic interaction of D551 with K1250. Phosphorylation-dependent potentiation of wildtype CFTR and other variants also was observed in epithelial cells. Hence, the efficacy of potentiators may be obscured by a ceiling effect when drug screening is performed under strongly phosphorylating conditions. These results should be considered in campaigns for CFTR potentiator discovery, and may enable the expansion of VX-770 to CF patients bearing ultra-orphan CFTR mutations.},

abstract = {Fast transverse relaxation of 1H, 15N, and 13C by dipole-dipole coupling (DD) and chemical shift anisotropy (CSA) modulated by rotational molecular motions has a dominant impact on the size limit for biomacromolecular structures that can be studied by NMR spectroscopy in solution. Transverse relaxation-optimized spectroscopy (TROSY) is an approach for suppression of transverse relaxation in multidimensional NMR experiments, which is based on constructive use of interference between DD coupling and CSA. For example, a TROSY-type two-dimensional 1H,15N-correlation experiment with a uniformly 15N-labeled protein in a DNA complex of molecular mass 17 kDa at a 1H frequency of 750 MHz showed that 15N relaxation during 15N chemical shift evolution and 1HN relaxation during signal acquisition both are significantly reduced by mutual compensation of the DD and CSA interactions. The reduction of the linewidths when compared with a conventional two-dimensional 1H,15N-correlation experiment was 60{\%} and 40{\%}, respectively, and the residual linewidths were 5 Hz for 15N and 15 Hz for 1HN at 4°C. Because the ratio of the DD and CSA relaxation rates is nearly independent of the molecular size, a similar percentagewise reduction of the overall transverse relaxation rates is expected for larger proteins. For a 15N-labeled protein of 150 kDa at 750 MHz and 20°C one predicts residual linewidths of 10 Hz for 15N and 45 Hz for 1HN, and for the corresponding uniformly 15N,2H-labeled protein the residual linewidths are predicted to be smaller than 5 Hz and 15 Hz, respectively. The TROSY principle should benefit a variety of multidimensional solution NMR experiments, especially with future use of yet somewhat higher polarizing magnetic fields than are presently available, and thus largely eliminate one of the key factors that limit work with larger molecules.},

We consider that there is plenty of room for the development of fundamental research in the field of DESs because their compositional flexibility makes the number of DESs susceptible of preparation unlimited and so do the range of properties that DESs can attain. Ultimately, these properties can be transferred into the resulting materials in terms of both tailored morphologies and compositions. Thus, interesting applications can be easily envisaged, especially in those fields in which the preparation of high-tech products via low cost processes is critical. We hope that the preliminary work surveyed in this review will encourage scientists to explore the promising perspectives offered by DESs. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

abstract = {The magnitudes and distributions of subconductance states were studied in chloride channels formed by the wild-type cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) and in CFTRs bearing amino acid substitutions in transmembrane segment 6. Within an open burst, it was possible to distinguish three distinct conductance states referred to as the full conductance, subconductance 1, and subconductance 2 states. Amino acid substitutions in transmembrane segment 6 altered the duration and probability of occurrence of these subconductance states but did not greatly alter their relative amplitudes. Results from real time measurements indicated that covalent modification of single R334C-CFTR channels by [2-(trimethylammonium)ethyl]methanethiosulfonate resulted in the simultaneous modification of all three conductance levels in what appeared to be a single step, without changing the proportion of time spent in each state. This behavior suggests that at least a portion of the conduction path is common to all three conducting states. The time course for the modification of R334C-CFTR, measured in outside-out macropatches using a rapid perfusion system, was also consistent with a single modification step as if each pore contained only a single copy of the cysteine at position 334. These results are consistent with a model for the CFTR conduction pathway in which a single anion-conducting pore is formed by a single CFTR polypeptide.},

abstract = {G551D is a major disease-associated gating mutation in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein, an ATP- and phosphorylation-dependent chloride channel. G551D causes severe cystic fibrosis (CF) disease by disrupting ATP-dependent channel opening; however, whether G551D affects phosphorylation-dependent channel activation is unclear. Here, we use macropatch recording and Ussing chamber approaches to demonstrate that G551D impacts on phosphorylation-dependent activation of CFTR, and PKA-mediated phosphorylation regulates the interaction between the x-loop in nucleotide-binding domain 2 (NBD2) and cytosolic loop (CL) 1. We show that G551D not only disrupts ATP-dependent channel opening but also impairs phosphorylation-dependent channel activation by largely reducing PKA sensitivity consistent with the reciprocal relationship between channel opening/gating, ligand binding, and phosphorylation. Furthermore, we identified two novel GOF mutations: D1341R in the x-loop near the ATP-binding cassette signature motif in NBD2 and D173R in CL1, each of which strongly increased PKA sensitivity both in the wild-type (WT) background and when introduced into G551D-CFTR. When D1341R was combined with a second GOF mutation (e.g., K978C in CL3), we find that the double GOF mutation maximally increased G551D channel activity such that VX-770 had no further effect. We further show that a double chargereversal mutation of D1341R/D173R-CFTR exhibited similar PKA sensitivity when compared with WT-CFTR. Together, our results suggest that charge repulsion between D173 and D1341 of WT-CFTR normally inhibits channel activation at low PKA activity by reducing PKA sensitivity, and negative allostery by the G551D is coupled to reduced PKA sensitivity of CFTR that can be restored by second GOF mutations.},

abstract = {Supported nanoparticle synthesis and assembly have application in a wide range of modern day applications. Key to the manipulation of the particle assembly is an understanding of the interaction between the particles and solvent. Here, we employ a comprehensive in situ approach, together with ex situ SEM imaging, to study supported palladium nanoparticles, electrodeposited from a 2:1 urea:choline Cl- DES. Using cyclic voltammetry, we confirm the expected adsorption of electroactive species onto the deposited particles. On the basis of our experimental results, we conclude that the electrodeposited nanoparticles assemble into 2-D superstructures, rich in adsorbed species. The abundance of these adsorbed species, within the superstructure, induces an anionic layer above them, which can be observed by ultrasmall-angle X-ray scattering (USAXS) as well as electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The surface charge of the particles is, therefore, not neutralized locally, as is the case with traditional colloidal systems. We also show that these otherwise stable nanoparticles readily aggregate when the DES is removed. Thus, the stability of these particles is contingent upon the presence of the DES. {\textcopyright} 2013 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {It has been over four decades since the development of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) using a hybridoma cell line was first reported. Since then more than thirty therapeutic antibodies have been marketed, mostly as oncology, autoimmune and inflammatory therapeutics. While antibodies are very efficient, their cost-effectiveness has always been discussed owing to their high costs, accumulating to more than one billion dollars from preclinical development through to market approval. Because of this, therapeutic antibodies are inaccessible to some patients in both developed and developing countries. The growing interest in biosimilar antibodies as affordable versions of therapeutic antibodies may provide alternative treatment options as well potentially decreasing costs. As certain markets begin to capitalize on this opportunity, regulatory authorities continue to refine the requirements for demonstrating quality, efficacy and safety of biosimilar compared to originator products. In addition to biosimilars, innovations in antibody engineering are providing the opportunity to design biobetter antibodies with improved properties to maximize efficacy. Enhancing effector function, antibody drug conjugates (ADC) or targeting multiple disease pathways via multi-specific antibodies are being explored. The manufacturing process of antibodies is also moving forward with advancements relating to host cell production and purification processes. Studies into the physical and chemical degradation pathways of antibodies are contributing to the design of more stable proteins guided by computational tools. Moreover, the delivery and pharmacokinetics of antibody-based therapeutics are improving as optimized formulations are pursued through the implementation of recent innovations in the field.},

abstract = {A systematic analysis is performed on the effectiveness of removing degrees of freedom from hydrogen atoms and/or increasing hydrogen masses to increase the efficiency of molecular dynamics simulations of hydrogen-rich systems such as proteins in water. In proteins, high-frequency bond-angle vibrations involving hydrogen atoms limit the time step to 3 fs, which is already a factor of 1.5 beyond the commonly used time step of 2 fs. Removing these degrees of freedom from the system by constructing hydrogen atoms as dummy atoms, allows the time step to be increased to 7 fs, a factor of 3.5 compared with 2 fs. Additionally, a gain in simulation stability can be achieved by increasing the masses of hydrogen atoms with remaining degrees of freedom from 1 to 4 u. Increasing hydrogen mass without removing the high-frequency degrees of freedom allows the time step to be increased only to 4 fs, a factor of two, compared with 2 fs. The net gain in efficiency of sampling configurational space may be up to 15{\%} lower than expected from the increase in time step due to the increase in viscosity and decrease in diffusion constant. In principle, introducing dummy atoms and increasing hydrogen mass do not influence thermodynamical properties of the system and dynamical properties are shown to be influenced only to a moderate degree. Comparing the maximum time step attainable with these methods (7 fs) to the time step of 2 fs that is routinely used in simulation, and taking into account the increase in viscosity and decrease in diffusion constant, we can say that a net gain in simulation efficiency of a factor of 3 to 3.5 can be achieved. {\textcopyright} 1999 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Inc.},

abstract = {Experimental and computational studies have painted a picture of the chloride permeation pathway in cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) as a short narrow tunnel flanked by wider inner and outer vestibules. Although these studies also identified a number of transmembrane segments (TMs) as porelining, the exact location of CFTR's gate(s) remains unknown. Here, using a channel-permeant probe, [Au(CN)2]-, we provide evidence that CFTR bears a gate that coincides with the predicted narrow section of the pore defined as residues 338-341 in TM6. Specifically, cysteines introduced cytoplasmic to the narrow region (i.e., positions 344 in TM6 and 1148 in TM12) can be modified by intracellular [Au(CN)2]-, in both open and closed states, corroborating the conclusion that the internal vestibule does not harbor a gate. However, cysteines engineered to positions external to the presumed narrow region (e.g., 334, 335, and 337 in TM6) are all nonreactive toward cytoplasmic [Au(CN)2]-, in the absence of ATP, whereas they can be better accessed by extracellular [Au(CN)2]-, when the open probability ismarkedly reduced by introducing a second mutation, G1349D. As [Au(CN)2]-, and chloride ions share the same permeation pathway, these results imply a gate is situated between amino acid residues 337 and 344 along TM6, encompassing the very segment that may also serve as the selectivity filter for CFTR. The unique position of a gate in the middle of the ion translocation pathway diverges from those seen in ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters and thus distinguishes CFTR from other members of the ABC transporter family.},

abstract = {Classical molecular dynamic (MD) simulation of membrane proteins faces significant challenges in accurately reproducing and predicting experimental observables such as ion conductance and permeability due to its incapability of precisely describing the electronic interactions in heterogeneous systems. In this work, the free energy profiles of K+ and Na+ permeating through the gramicidin A channel are characterized by using the AMOEBA polarizable force field with a total sampling time of 1 $\mu$s. Our results indicated that by explicitly introducing the multipole terms and polarization into the electrostatic potentials, the permeation free energy barrier of K+ through the gA channel is considerably reduced compared to the overestimated results obtained from the fixed-charge model. Moreover, the estimated maximum conductance, without any corrections, for both K+ and Na+ passing through the gA channel are much closer to the experimental results than any classical MD simulations, demonstrating the power of AMOEBA in investigating the membrane proteins.},

abstract = {Alzheimer disease (AD) is the most common type of dementia, and is currently incurable; existing treatments for AD produce only a modest amelioration of symptoms. Research into this disease has conventionally focused on the CNS. However, several peripheral and systemic abnormalities are now understood to be linked to AD, and our understanding of how these alterations contribute to AD is becoming more clearly defined. This Review focuses on amyloid-$\beta$ (A$\beta$), a major hallmark of AD. We review emerging findings of associations between systemic abnormalities and A$\beta$ metabolism, and describe how these associations might interact with or reflect on the central pathways of A$\beta$ production and clearance. On the basis of these findings, we propose that these abnormal systemic changes might not only develop secondary to brain dysfunction but might also affect AD progression, suggesting that the interactions between the brain and the periphery have a crucial role in the development and progression of AD. Such a systemic view of the molecular pathogenesis of AD could provide a novel perspective for understanding this disease and present new opportunities for its early diagnosis and treatment.},

Equivalence of the two theories in bulk situations is demonstrated in a control study. In simple cylindrical channels, considerable differences are found between the two theories with regard to the concentration profiles in the channel and its conductance properties. These differences are at a maximum in narrow channels with a radius smaller than the Debye length and diminish with increasing radius. Convergence occurs when the channel radius is over 2 Debye lengths. These tests unequivocally demonstrate that the mean- field approximation in the Poisson-Nernst-Planck theory breaks down in narrow ion channels that have radii smaller than the Debye length.},

abstract = {Previously we showed that the functional activity of the epithelial chloride channel that is encoded by the cystic fibrosis gene (CFTR) is reciprocally modulated by two components of the vesicle fusion machinery, syntaxin 1A and Munc-18. Here we report that syntaxin 1A inhibits CFTR chloride channels by means of direct and domain-specific protein-protein interactions. Syntaxin 1A stoichiometrically binds to the N-terminal cytoplasmic tail of CFTR, and this binding is blocked by Munc-18. The modulation of CFTR currents by syntaxin 1A is eliminated either by deletion of this tail or by injecting this tail as a blocking peptide into coexpressing Xenopus oocytes. The CFTR binding site on syntaxin 1A maps to the third predicted helical domain (H3) of this membrane protein. Moreover, CFTR Cl- currents are effectively inhibited by a minimal syntaxin 1A construct (i.e., the membrane-anchored H3 domain) that cannot fully substitute for wild-type syntaxin 1A in membrane fusion reactions. We also show that syntaxin 1A binds to and inhibits the activities of disease- associated mutants of CFTR, and that the chloride current activity of recombinant $\Delta$F508 CFTR (i.e., the most common cystic fibrosis mutant) can be potentiated by disrupting its interaction with syntaxin 1A in cultured epithelial cells. Our results provide evidence for a direct physical interaction between CFTR and syntaxin 1A that limits the functional activities of normal and disease-associated forms of this chloride channel.},

abstract = {The efficient and sustainable separation of azeotropic mixtures remains a challenge in chemical engineering. In this work, the performance of benign solvents, namely deep eutectic solvents (DES), in the separation of aromatic-aliphatic hydrocarbon azeotropic mixtures via liquid-liquid extraction (LLE) was evaluated. The DES studied in this work were based on different ammonium salts (cholinium chloride, [Ch]Cl, benzylcholinium chloride, [BzCh]Cl, and tetrabutylammonium chloride, [N4444]Cl) as hydrogen bond acceptor (HBA) and one organic acid (levulinic acid, LevA) as hydrogen bond donor (HBD), always in the mole ratio of 1 HBA:2 HBD. The thermophysical properties, namely density and viscosity, of the three used DES were measured in the temperature range T = (293.15 up to 353.15) K and at atmospheric pressure. The phase equilibria diagrams of all ternary systems were determined at T = 298.15 K and at atmospheric pressure using 1H NMR spectroscopy. The results showed that the introduction of a more hydrophobic HBA in the DES promotes the improvement of the distribution coefficient, while playing with the aromaticity of the DES leads to higher selectivity. In addition, the performance of the predictive conductor-like screening model for real solvent (COSMO-RS) model in the description of these systems was also evaluated. COSMO-RS is capable of quantitatively predicting the phase behavior and tie-lines for ternary mixtures containing DES as well as of estimating the trend of distribution ratio and selectivity.},

abstract = {At present, there are very few therapeutic options for patients affected by amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). However, almost all patients affected by ALS or tau-negative FTD share in their brains the presence of aggregated TDP-43, a nuclear factor that plays an important role in regulating RNA metabolism. For this reason, this protein represents a very promising target to develop novel therapeutic options. Over the years, these options have mostly involved the search for new effectors capable of reducing aberrant aggregation or enhancing its clearance by UPS-dependent protein quality control or autophagy system. Targeting eventual mutations in the sequence of this protein might represent a parallel alternative therapeutic option. To this date, the study of various patient populations has allowed to find more than 50 mutations associated with disease. It is, therefore, important to better understand what the functional consequences of these mutations are. As discussed in this review, the emerging picture is that most TDP-43 mutations appear to directly relate to specific disease features such as increased aggregation, half-life, or altered cellular localization and protein-protein interactions. {\textcopyright} 2015 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), encoded by the gene mutated in cystic fibrosis patients, belongs to the family of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) proteins, but, unlike other members, functions as a chloride channel. CFTR is activated by protein kinase A (PKA)-mediated phosphorylation of multiple sites in its regulatory domain, and gated by binding and hydrolysis of ATP at its two nucleotide binding domains (NBD1, NBD2). The recent crystal structure of NBD1 from mouse CFTR (Lews, H.A., S.G. Buchanan, S.K. Burley, K. Conners, M. Dickey, M. Dorwart, R. Fowler, X. Gao, W.B. Guggino, W.A. Hendrickson, et al. 2004. EMBO J. 23: 282-293) identified two regions absent from structures of all other NBDs determined so far, a "regulatory insertion" (residues 404-435) and a "regulatory extension" (residues 639-670), both positioned to impede formation of the putative NBD1-NBD2 dimer anticipated to occur during channel gating; as both segments appeared highly mobile and both contained consensus PKA sites (serine 422, and serines 660 and 670, respectively), it was suggested that their phosphorylation-linked conformational changes might underlie CFTR channel regulation. To test that suggestion, we coexpressed in Xenopus oocytes CFTR residues 1-414 with residues 433-1480, or residues 1-633 with 668-1480, to yield split CFTR channels (called 414+433 and 633+668) that lack most of the insertion, or extension, respectively. In excised patches, regulation of the resulting CFTR channels by PKA and by ATP was largely normal. Both 414+433 channels and 633+668 channels, as well as 633(S422A)+668 channels (lacking both the extension and the sole PKA consensus site in the insertion), were all shut during exposure to MgATP before addition of PKA, but activated like wild type (WT) upon phosphorylation; this indicates that inhibitory regulation of nonphosphorylated WT channels depends upon neither segment. Detailed kinetic analysis of 414+433 channels revealed intact ATP dependence of single-channel gating kinetics, but slightly shortened open bursts and faster closing from the locked-open state (elicited by ATP plus pyrophosphate or ATP plus AMPPNP). In contrast, 633+668 channel function was indistinguishable from WT at both macroscopic and microscopic levels. We conclude that neither nonconserved segment is an essential element of PKA- or nucleotide-dependent regulation.},

Growing evidence suggests that proteome homeostasis underlies ALS pathogenesis. Protein production, trafficking, and degradation all shape the proteome. We present a hypothesis that proposes all genetic lesions associated with ALS (including in mRNA-binding proteins) cause widespread imbalance to an already metastable proteome. The impact of such dysfunction is felt across the entire proteome and is not restricted to a small subset of proteins. Proteome imbalance may cause functional defects, such as excitability alterations, and eventually cell death. While this idea is a unifying principle for all of ALS, we propose that stratification will appear that might dictate the efficacy of therapeutics based on the proteostasis network.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Postnatal evaluation revealed ventricular dilation and systolic dysfunction, bilateral cataracts, and mild facial dysmorphisms. Comprehensive metabolic and genetic testing, including chromosomal microarray, mitochondrial DNA and targeted RASopathy gene sequencing, and clinical whole exome sequencing for known cardiomyopathy genes was non-diagnostic. Following exclusion of asymptomatic DCM in the parents, trio-based whole exome sequencing was carried out on a research basis, filtering for rare, predicted deleterious de novo and recessive variants. An unreported de novo S75Y mutation was discovered in RRAGC, encoding Ras-related GTP binding C, an essential GTPase in nutrient-activated mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling. In silico protein modeling and molecular dynamics simulation predicted the mutation to disrupt ligand interactions and increase the GDP-bound state. Overexpression of RagCS75Y rendered AD293 cells partially insensitive to amino acid deprivation, resulting in increased mTORC1 signaling compared to wild-type RagC. These findings implicate mTORC1 dysregulation through a gain-of-function mutation in RagC as a novel molecular basis for syndromic forms of pediatric heart failure, and expand genotype–phenotype correlation in RASopathy-related syndromes.},

abstract = {Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is a chloride channel belonging to the ATP binding cassette (ABC) protein superfamily. Currently, it remains unclear how ATP binding causes the opening of the channel gate at the molecular level. To clarify this mechanism, we first constructed an atomic model of the inward-facing CFTR using the X-ray structures of other ABC proteins. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were then performed to explore the structure and dynamics of the inward-facing CFTR in a membrane environment. In the MgATP-bound state, two nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs) formed a head-to-tail type of dimer, in which the ATP molecules were sandwiched between the Walker A and signature motifs. Alternatively, one of the final MD structures in the apo state was similar to that of a "closed-apo" conformation found in the X-ray analysis of ATP-free MsbA. Principal component analysis for the MD trajectory indicated that NBD dimerization causes significant structural and dynamical changes in the transmembrane domains (TMDs), which is likely indicative of the formation of a chloride ion access path. This study suggests that the free energy gain from ATP binding acts as a driving force not only for NBD dimerization but also for NBD-TMD concerted motions. {\textcopyright} 2012 American Chemical Society.},

We propose a method that combines Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and reinforcement learning (RL) in order to accomplish exactly that. While RL biases the data generation process towards arbitrary metrics, the GAN component of the reward function ensures that the model still remembers information learned from data. We build upon previous results that incorporated GANs and RL in order to generate sequence data and test this model in several settings for the generation of molecules encoded as text sequences (SMILES) and in the context of music generation, showing for each case that we can effectively bias the generation process towards desired metrics.},

abstract = {The relative prevalence of native protein-protein interactions (PPIs) are the cornerstone for understanding the structure, dynamics and mechanisms of function of protein complexes. In this study, we develop a scheme for scaling the protein-water interaction in the CHARMM36 force field, in order to better fit the solvation free energy of amino acids side-chain analogues. We find that the molecular dynamics simulation with the scaled force field, CHARMM36s, as well as a recently released version, CHARMM36m, effectively improve on the overly sticky association of proteins, such as ubiquitin. We investigate the formation of a heterodimer protein complex between the SAM domains of the EphA2 receptor and the SHIP2 enzyme by performing a combined total of 48 $\mu$s simulations with the different potential functions. While the native SAM heterodimer is only predicted at a low rate of 6.7{\%} with the original CHARMM36 force field, the yield is increased to 16.7{\%} with CHARMM36s, and to 18.3{\%} with CHARMM36m. By analyzing the 25 native SAM complexes formed in the simulations, we find that their formation involves a preorientation guided by Coulomb interactions, consistent with an electrostatic steering mechanism. In 12 cases, the complex could directly transform to the native protein interaction surfaces with only small adjustments in domain orientation. In the other 13 cases, orientational and/or translational adjustments are needed to reach the native complex. Although the tendency for non-native complexes to dissociate has nearly doubled with the modified potential functions, a dissociation followed by a reassociation to the correct complex structure is still rare. Instead, the remaining non-native complexes undergo configurational changes/surface searching, which, however, rarely leads to native structures on a time scale of 250 ns. These observations provide a rich picture of the mechanisms of protein-protein complex formation and suggest that computational predictions of native complex PPIs could be improved further.},

abstract = {Background: To determine in vivo effects of CFTR modulators on mutation S945L. Methods: We measured effects of CFTR modulators on CFTR-dependent sweating (‘C-sweat') in two pancreatic sufficient cystic fibrosis (CF) subjects. S1 (S945L/G542X) took ivacaftor and S2 (S945L/F508del) took ivacaftor + tezacaftor. Sweating was stimulated pharmacologically to produce sequentially both CFTR-independent (methacholine stimulated) M-sweat and C-sweat; and the ratio of these was compared. Sweat secretion was measured with two methods: real time secretory rate quantitative recording and by optically measuring the growth of sweat bubbles under oil from multiple identified glands. Results: Using the quantitative recorder, we saw zero C-sweat secretion off-drug, but when on-drug the C-sweat responses for both subjects were comparable to those seen in carriers. The on-drug response was further quantified using the sweat bubble method. Each subject again showed robust C-sweat responses, with C-sweat/M-sweat ratios {\~{}} half of the ratio determined for a cohort of 40 controls tested under identical conditions. Conclusion: These in vivo results, consistent with prior in vitro findings, indicate that the drug treatments restore near-normal function to S945L-CFTR, and support the use of ivacaftor as a treatment for CF patients who carry this allele.},

abstract = {Deep eutectic solvents (DESs) are exemplars of systems with the ability to form neutral, ionic and doubly ionic H-bonds. Herein, the pairwise interactions of the constituent components of the choline chloride-urea DES are examined. Evidence is found for a tripodal CH⋯Cl doubly ionic H-bond motif. Moreover it is found that the covalency of doubly ionic H-bonds can be greater than, or comparable with, neutral and ionic examples. In contrast to many traditional solvents, an alphabet soup of many different types of H-bond (OH⋯OC, NH...OC, OH...Cl, NH...Cl, OH...NH, CH...Cl, CH...OC, NH...OH and NH...NH) can form. These H-bonds exhibit substantial flexibility in terms of number and strength. It is anticipated that H-bonding will have a significant impact on the entropy of the system and thus could play an important role in the formation of the eutectic. The 2:1 urea:choline-chloride eutectic point of this DES is often associated with the formation of a [Cl(urea)2]- complexed anion. However, urea is found to form a H-bonded urea[choline]+ complexed cation that is energetically competitive with [Cl(urea)2]-. The negative charge on [Cl(urea)2]- is found to remain localised on the chloride, moreover, the urea[choline]+ complexed cation forms the strongest H-bond studied here. Thus, there is potential to consider a urea[choline]+{\textperiodcentered}urea[Cl]- interaction.},

As an ion channel, CFTR must form a continuous pathway across the cell membrane—referred to as the channel pore—for the rapid electrodiffusional movement of ions. This review summarizes our current understanding of the architecture of the channel pore, as defined by electrophysiological analysis and molecular modeling studies. This includes consideration of the characteristic functional properties of the pore, definition of the overall shape of the entire extent of the pore, and discussion of how the molecular structure of distinct regions of the pore might control different facets of pore function. Comparisons are drawn with closely related proteins that are not ion channels, and also with structurally unrelated proteins with anion channel function. A simple model of pore function is also described.},

abstract = {The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is a Cl channel that apparently has evolved from an ancestral active transporter. Key to the CFTR's switch from pump to channel function may have been the appearance of one or more “lateral portals.” Such portals connect the cytoplasm to the transmembrane channel pore, allowing a continuous pathway for the electrodiffusional movement of Cl ions. However, these portals remain the least well-characterized part of the Cl transport pathway; even the number of functional portals is uncertain, and if multiple portals do exist, their relative functional contributions are unknown. Here, we used patch-clamp recording to identify the contributions of positively charged amino acid side chains located in CFTR's cytoplasmic transmembrane extensions to portal function. Mutagenesis-medi-ated neutralization of several charged side chains reduced single-channel Cl conductance. However, these same mutations differentially affected channel blockade by cytoplasmic suramin and Pt(NO2)42 anions. We considered and tested several models by which the contribution of these positively charged side chains to one or more independent or non-independent portals to the pore could affect Cl conductance and interactions with blockers. Overall, our results suggest the existence of a single portal that is lined by several positively charged side chains that interact electrostatically with both Cl and blocking anions. We further propose that mutations at other sites indirectly alter the function of this single portal. Comparison of our functional results with recent structural information on CFTR completes our picture of the overall molecular architecture of the Cl permeation pathway.},

We show that solvation free energies of ions can be calculated using the spherical boundary conditions without introducing any corrections at the boundary via a buffer zone. The results are shown to converge for a droplet size of 21 {\AA} and are independent of the parameters used for confining water or restraining the ion. The proposed method thus resolves the robustness issues in solvation free energy calculations of ions and can be used with confidence to determine force field parameters from such calculations. We apply the method to calculate the solvation free energies of the side chain analogs of charged amino acids. Tests using periodic boundary conditions show that similar results are also obtained in that case.},

abstract = {Previous studies have identified several transmembrane segments (TMs), including TM1, TM3, TM6, TM9, TM11, and TM12, as pore-lining segments in cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), but the role of TM5 in pore construction remains controversial. In this study, we employed substituted cysteine accessibility methodology (SCAM) to screen the entire TM5 defined by the original topology model and its cytoplasmic extension in a Cysless background. We found six positions (A299, R303, N306, S307, F310, and F311) where engineered cysteines react to intracellular 2-sulfonatoethyl methanethiosulfonate (MTSES-). Quantification of the modification rate of engineered cysteines in the presence or absence of ATP suggests that these six residues are accessible in both the open and closed states. Whole-cell experiments with external MTSES- identified only two positive positions (L323 and A326), resulting in a segment containing 11 consecutive amino acids, where substituted cysteines respond to neither internal nor external MTSES-, a unique feature not seen previously in CFTR's pore-lining segments. The observation that these positions are inaccessible to channel-permeant thiol-specific reagent [Au(CN)2]2' suggests that this segment of TM5 between F311 and L323 is concealed from the pore by other TMs and/or lipid bilayers. In addition, our data support the idea that the positively charged arginine at position 303 poses a pure electrostatic action in determining the single-channel current amplitude of CFTR and the effect of an open-channel blocker glibencalmide. Collectively, we conclude that the cytoplasmic portion of CFTR's TM5 lines the pore. Our functional data are remarkably consistent with predicted structural arrangements of TM5 in some homology models of CFTR.},

abstract = {Folding funnel is the essential concept of the free energy landscape for ordered proteins. How does this concept apply to intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs)? Here, we address this fundamental question through the explicit characterization of the free energy landscapes of the representative $\alpha$-helical (HP-35) and $\beta$-sheet (WW domain) proteins and of an IDP (pKID) that folds upon binding to its partner (KIX). We demonstrate that HP-35 and WW domain indeed exhibit the steep folding funnel: the landscape slope for these proteins is ca. −50 kcal/mol, meaning that the free energy decreases by {\~{}}5 kcal/mol upon the formation of 10{\%} native contacts. On the other hand, the landscape of pKID is funneled but considerably shallower (slope of −24 kcal/mol), which explains why pKID is disordered in free environments. Upon binding to KIX, the landscape of pKID now becomes significantly steep (slope of −54 kcal/mol), which enables otherwise disordered pKID to fold. We also show that it is the pKID–KIX intermolecular interactions originating from hydrophobic residues that mainly confer the steep folding funnel. The present work not only provides the quantitative characterization of the protein folding free energy landscape, but also establishes the usefulness of the folding funnel concept to IDPs.},

abstract = {A significant challenge to making targeted CFTR modulator therapies accessible to all individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF) are many mutations in the CFTR gene that can cause CF, most of which remain uncharacterized. Here, we characterized the structural and functional defects of the rare CFTR mutation R352Q – with potential role contributing to intrapore chloride ion permeation – in patient-derived cell models of the airway and gut. CFTR function in differentiated nasal epithelial cultures and matched intestinal organoids was assessed using ion transport assay and forskolin-induced swelling (FIS) assay respectively. Two CFTR potentiators (VX-770, GLPG1837) and a corrector (VX-809) were tested. Data from R352Q-CFTR were compared to that of participants with mutations with known impact on CFTR function. R352Q-CFTR has residual CFTR function which was restored to functional CFTR activity by CFTR potentiators but not the corrector. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of R352Q-CFTR were carried out which indicated the presence of a chloride conductance defect, with little evidence supporting a gating defect. The combination approach of in vitro patient-derived cell models and in silico MD simulations to characterize rare CFTR mutations can improve the specificity and sensitivity of modulator response predictions and aid in their translational use for CF precision medicine.

abstract = {Ubiquitin-like proteins (UBLs) are conjugated by dynamic E1-E2-E3 enzyme cascades. E1 enzymes activate UBLs by catalysing UBL carboxy-terminal adenylation, forming a covalent E1 ∼ UBL thioester intermediate, and generating a thioester-linked E2 ∼ UBL product, which must be released for subsequent reactions. Here we report the structural analysis of a trapped UBL activation complex for the human NEDD8 pathway, containing NEDD8's heterodimeric E1 (APPBP1-UBA3), two NEDD8s (one thioester-linked to E1, one noncovalently associated for adenylation), a catalytically inactive E2 (Ubc12), and MgATP. The results suggest that a thioester switch toggles E1-E2 affinities. Two E2 binding sites depend on NEDD8 being thioester-linked to E1. One is unmasked by a striking E1 conformational change. The other comes directly from the thioester-bound NEDD8. After NEDD8 transfer to E2, reversion to an alternate E1 conformation would facilitate release of the E2 ∼ NEDD8 thioester product. Thus, transferring the UBL's thioester linkage between successive conjugation enzymes can induce conformational changes and alter interaction networks to drive consecutive steps in UBL cascades. {\textcopyright}2007 Nature Publishing Group.},

abstract = {Recently, post-explosion nuclear forensics, or nuclear attribution, has gained a new spotlight within the nuclear weapons scientific and policymaking community. Academics are beginning to ask whether post-explosion forensics might create a replacement for an international nonproliferation regime, or at least offer a fallback option to deter states and individuals from selling nuclear materials. This paper examines current attribution technology from unclassified literature and finds the technology to be well developed but not foolproof, such that nuclear attribution currently provides little deterrent value. If current capabilities were publicized more thoroughly and if the post-explosion process of assessing the evidence were internationalized, states and intermediate actors might be deterred more effectively. Developing a nuclear fingerprint database is also discussed. While useful, its impact on deterrence would be minimal.

abstract = {We introduce the "Prime-ligand" method for ranking ligands in congeneric series. The method employs a single scoring function, the OPLS-AA/GBSA molecular mechanics/implicit solvent model, for all stages of sampling and scoring. We evaluate the method using 12 test sets of congeneric series for which experimental binding data is available in the literature, as well as the structure of one member of the series bound to the protein. Ligands are "docked" by superimposing a common stem fragment among the compounds in the series using a crystal complex from the Protein Data Bank and sampling the conformational space of the variable region. Our results show good correlation between our predicted rankings and the experimental data for cases in which binding affinities differ by at least 1 order of magnitude. For 11 out of 12 cases, {\textgreater}90{\%} of such ligand pairs could be correctly ranked, while for the remaining case, Factor Xa, 76{\%} of such pairs were correctly ranked. A small number of compounds could not be docked using the current protocol because of the large size of functional groups that could not be accommodated by a rigid receptor. CPU requirements for the method, involving CPU minutes per ligand, are modest compared with more rigorous methods that use similar force fields, such as free energy perturbation. We also benchmark the scoring function using series of ligands bound to the same protein within the CSAR data set. We demonstrate that energy minimization of ligands in the crystal structures is critical to obtain any correlation with experimentally determined binding affinities. {\textcopyright} 2011 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {Arginine 352 (R352) in the sixth transmembrane domain of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) previously was reported to form an anion/cation selectivity filter and to provide positive charge in the intracellular vestibule. However, mutations at this site have nonspecific effects, such as inducing susceptibility of endogenous cysteines to chemical modification. We hypothesized that R352 stabilizes channel structure and that charge-destroying mutations at this site disrupt pore architecture, with multiple consequences. We tested the effects of mutations at R352 on conductance, anion selectivity and block by the sulfonylurea drug glipizide, using recordings of wild-type and mutant channels. Charge-altering mutations at R352 destabilized the open state and altered both selectivity and block. In contrast, R352K-CFTR was similar to wild-type. Full conductance state amplitude was similar to that of wild-type CFTR in all mutants except R352E, suggesting that R352 does not itself form an anion coordination site. In an attempt to identify an acidic residue that may interact with R352, we found that permeation properties were similarly affected by charge-reversing mutations at D993. Wild-type-like properties were rescued in R352E/D993R-CFTR, suggesting that R352 and D993 in the wild-type channel may interact to stabilize pore architecture. Finally, R352A-CFTR was sensitive to modification by externally applied MTSEA+, while wild-type and R352E/D993R-CFTR were not. These data suggest that R352 plays an important structural role in CFTR, perhaps reflecting its involvement in forming a salt bridge with residue D993. {\textcopyright} 2008 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract = {Increasing applications of ionic liquids and their analogues, namely Deep Eutectic Solvents (DESs), requires further investigation into the effect of moisture content on the physico-chemical characteristics of these fluids. Although it is common practice to synthesize these fluids in a moisture-controlled environment, as moisture is generally considered to have an impact on their properties, there are no systematic studies on this. We herein examine the effects of water on Reline, a Type-III DES composed of urea and choline chloride. Experiments were performed to obtain the physical properties of aqueous Reline solution. We observed moderate changes in density, speed of sound, refractive index, and pH with increasing water fraction; however, the change in viscosity and conductivity was strong and exponential. In addition, molecular dynamics simulations were performed to analyze the intermolecular interactions of Reline and aqueous Reline solutions. The simulations primarily present the significance of urea-anion interaction to explain the low melting point of the DES. In the presence of water, the anion is preferentially hydrated as compared to urea or the cation. More interestingly, simulations help to classify the effects of water into different regimes. At low water fractions ({\textless}5{\%}) the urea-urea interactions are enhanced, as is revealed through the hydrogen bond analysis. Beyond 25{\%} water fractions, the components of Reline are individually hydrated and have high diffusivity, which is further reflected in the change in transport properties. The results presented herein provide valuable information on aqueous Reline solutions both in terms of experimental data and molecular insights, which in turn, we believe, might assist in developing further applications of Reline and other related DESs. {\textcopyright} the Partner Organisations 2014.},

abstract = {Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation has become a powerful tool because it provides a time series of protein dynamics at high temporal-spatial resolution. However, the accessible timescales of MD simulation are shorter than those of the biologically rare events. Generally, long-time MD simulations over microseconds are required to detect the rare events. Therefore, it is desirable to develop rare-event-sampling methods. For a rare-event-sampling method, we have developed parallel cascade selection MD (PaCS-MD). PaCS-MD generates transition pathways from a given source structure to a target structure by repeating short-time MD simulations. The key point in PaCS-MD is how to select reasonable candidates (protein configurations) with high potentials to make transitions toward the target structure. In the present study, based on principal component analysis (PCA), we propose PCA-based PaCS-MD to detect rare events of collective motions of a given protein. Here, the PCA-based PaCS-MD is composed of the following two steps. At first, as a preliminary run, PCA is performed using an MD trajectory from the target structure to define a principal coordinate (PC) subspace for describing the collective motions of interest. PCA provides principal modes as eigenvectors to project a protein configuration onto the PC subspace. Then, as a production run, all the snapshots of short-time MD simulations are ranked by inner products (IPs), where an IP is defined between a snapshot and the target structure. Then, snapshots with higher values of the IP are selected as reasonable candidates, and short-time MD simulations are independently restarted from them. By referring to the values of the IP, the PCA-based PaCS-MD repeats the short-time MD simulations from the reasonable candidates that are highly correlated with the target structure. As a demonstration, we applied the PCA-based PaCS-MD to adenylate kinase and detected its large-amplitude (open-closed) transition with a nanosecond-order computational cost.},

In combination with statistical thermodynamics theories, we present an efficient framework, which is used to classify structure modification effects consistently. The crucial importance of enthalpic and entropic contributions to the free energy change upon IL-assisted macromolecular unfolding in combination with a complex destabilization mechanism is described in detail. A special focus is also set on aqueous IL-DNA interactions, for which experimental and simulation outcomes are summarized and discussed in the context of previous findings.},

This structure reveals the position of the R domain after phosphorylation. By comparing the structures of human CFTR and zebrafish CFTR determined under the same condition, we identified common features essential to channel gating.

One of these is the fluctuation theorem, which places conditions on the entropy production probability distribution of nonequilibrium systems. Another recently discovered far from equilibrium expression relates nonequilibrium measurements of the work done on a system to equilibrium free energy differences. In this paper, we derive a generalized version of the fluctuation theorem for stochastic, microscopically reversible dynamics. Invoking this generalized theorem provides a succinct proof of the nonequilibrium work relation. {\textcopyright} 1999 The American Physical Society.},

abstract = {NAMD is a parallel molecular dynamics code designed for high-performance simulation of large biomolecular systems. NAMD scales to hundreds of processors on high-end parallel platforms, as well as tens of processors on low-cost commodity clusters, and also runs on individual desktop and laptop computers. NAMD works with AMBER and CHARMM potential functions, parameters, and file formats. This article, directed to novices as well as experts, first introduces concepts and methods used in the NAMD program, describing the classical molecular dynamics force field, equations of motion, and integration methods along with the efficient electrostatics evaluation algorithms employed and temperature and pressure controls used. Features for steering the simulation across barriers and for calculating both alchemical and conformational free energy differences are presented. The motivations for and a roadmap to the internal design of NAMD, implemented in C++ and based on Charm++ parallel objects, are outlined. The factors affecting the serial and parallel performance of a simulation are discussed. Finally, typical NAMD use is illustrated with representative applications to a small, a medium, and a large biomolecular system, highlighting particular features of NAMD, for example, the Tel scripting language. The article also provides a list of the key features of NAMD and discusses the benefits of combining NAMD with the molecular graphics/sequence analysis software VMD and the grid computing/collaboratory software BioCoRE.

abstract = {A large number of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) are mediated by the interactions between proteins and peptide segments binding partners, and therefore determination of protein-peptide interactions (PpIs) is quite crucial to elucidate important biological processes and design peptides or peptidomimetic drugs that can modulate PPIs. Nowadays, as a powerful computation tool, molecular docking has been widely utilized to predict the binding structures of protein-peptide complexes. However, although a number of docking programs have been available, the systematic study on the assessment of their performance for PpIs has never been reported. In this study, a benchmark data set called PepSet consisting of 185 protein-peptide complexes with peptide length ranging from 5 to 20 residues was employed to evaluate the performance of 14 docking programs, including three protein-protein docking programs (ZDOCK, FRODOCK, and HawkDock), three small molecule docking programs (GOLD, Surflex-Dock, and AutoDock Vina), and eight protein-peptide docking programs (GalaxyPepDock, MDockPeP, HPEPDOCK, CABS-dock, pepATTRACT, DINC, AutoDock CrankPep (ADCP), and HADDOCK peptide docking). A new evaluation parameter, named IL{\_}RMSD, was proposed to measure the docking accuracy with fnat (the fraction of native contacts). In global docking, HPEPDOCK performs the best for the entire data set and yields the success rates of 4.3{\%}, 24.3{\%}, and 55.7{\%} at the top 1, 10, and 100 levels, respectively. In local docking, overall, ADCP achieves the best predictions and reaches the success rates of 11.9{\%}, 37.3{\%}, and 70.3{\%} at the top 1, 10, and 100 levels, respectively. It is expected that our work can provide some helpful insights into the selection and development of improved docking programs for PpIs.

abstract = {Ionic liquids (ILs) have proven effective solvents for pretreating lignocellulose, leading to the fast saccharification of cellulose and hemicellulose. However, the high cost of most ILs remains a major barrier to commercializing this recent approach at a practical scale. As a strategic detour, aqueous solutions of ILs are also being explored as less costly alternatives to neat ILs for cellulose pretreatment. However, limited studies on a few select IL systems are known and there remains no systematic survey of various ILs, eluding an in-depth understanding of pretreatment mechanisms afforded by aqueous IL systems. As a step toward filling this gap, this study presents results for Avicel cellulose pretreatment by neat and aqueous solutions (1.0 and 2.0 M) of 20 different ILs and three deep eutectic solvents, correlating enzymatic hydrolysis rates of pretreated cellulose with various IL properties such as hydrogen-bond basicity, polarity, Hofmeister ranking, and hydrophobicity. The pretreatment efficiencies of neat ILs may be loosely correlated to the hydrogen-bond basicity of the constituent anion and IL polarity; however, the pretreatment efficacies for aqueous ILs are more complicated and cannot be simply related to any single IL property. Several aqueous IL systems have been identified as effective alternatives to neat ILs in lignocellulose pretreatment. In particular, this study reveals that aqueous solutions of 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium methanesulfonate ([BMIM][MeSO 3]) are effective for pretreating switchgrass (Panicum virgatum), resulting in fast saccharification of both cellulose and hemicellulose. An integrated analysis afforded by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, thermogravimetric analysis and cellulase adsorption isotherm of lignocellulose samples is further used to deliver a more complete view of the structural changes attending aqueous IL pretreatment. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

It binds and hydrolyzes ATP at its nucleotide binding domains to form a pore providing a diffusive pathway within its transmembrane domains. CFTR is the only known protein from the ABC superfamily with channel activity, and its dysfunction causes the disease cystic fibrosis. While much is known about the functional aspects of CFTR, significant gaps remain, such as the structure–function relationship underlying signaling of ATP binding.

These substances likely target key conformational changes occurring during channel opening and closing, however, the molecular bases of these conformational changes, and their susceptibility to manipulation are poorly understood. We have used patch clamp recording to identify changes in the three-dimensional organization of the extracellularly accessible parts of the CFTR protein during channel opening and closing. State-dependent formation of both disulfide bonds and Cd2+ bridges occurred for pairs of cysteine side-chains introduced into the extreme extracellular ends of transmembrane helices (TMs) 1, 6, and 12. Between each of these three TMs, we found that both disulfide bonds and metal bridges formed preferentially or exclusively in the closed state and that these inter-TM cross-links stabilized the closed state. These results indicate that the extracellular ends of these TMs are close together when the channel is closed and that they separate from each other when the channel opens. These findings identify for the first time key conformational changes in the extracellular parts of the CFTR protein that can potentially be manipulated to control channel activity.},

abstract = {Deletion of phenylalanine-508 (Phe-508) from the N-terminal nucleotide-binding domain (NBD1) of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), a member of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter family, disrupts both its folding and function and causes most cystic fibrosis. Most mutant nascent chains do not pass quality control in the ER, and those that do remain thermally unstable, only partially functional, and are rapidly endocytosed and degraded. Although the lack of the Phe-508 peptide backbone diminishes the NBD1 folding yield, the absence of the aromatic side chain is primarily responsible for defective CFTR assembly and channel gating. However, the site of interdomain contact by the side chain is unknown as is the high-resolution 3D structure of the complete protein. Here we present a 3D structure of CFTR, constructed by molecular modeling and supported biochemically, in which Phe-508 mediates a tertiary interaction between the surface of NBD1 and a cytoplasmic loop (CL4) in the C-terminal membrane-spanning domain (MSD2). This crucial cytoplasmic membrane interface, which is dynamically involved in regulation of channel gating, explains the known sensitivity of CFTR assembly to many disease-associated mutations in CL4 as well as NBD1 and provides a sharply focused target for small molecules to treat CF. In addition to identifying a key intramolecular site to be repaired therapeutically, our findings advance understanding of CFTR structure and function and provide a platform for focused biochemical studies of other features of this unique ABC ion channel. {\textcopyright} 2008 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.},

abstract = {Neddylation is a post-translational protein modification associated with cancer development. MLN4924 is a neddylation inhibitor currently under investigation in multiple phase I studies on various malignancies, and its clincal name is Pevonedistat. It has been documented that MLN4924 blocks Cullins neddylation and inactivates CRLs and, in turn, triggers cell-cycle arrest, apoptosis, senescence and autophagy in many cancer cells. In this study, we investigated the anti-tumor effect of MLN4924 in human clear cell renal carcinoma (ccRCC). Levels of both Nedd8 activating enzyme E1 and Nedd8-conjugating enzyme E2 were higher in ccRCC tissues and RCC cancer cells than in normal. Moreover, MLN4924 treatment led to rapid inhibition of Cullin1 neddylation and notably suppressed growth and survival as well as migration in a dose-and time-dependent manner. Mechanistic studies revealed that MLN4924 induced the accumulation of a number of CRL substrates, including p21, p27 and Wee1 to trigger DNA damage and induce growth arrest at the G2/M phase. MLN4924 also induced anti-migration and anti-invasion by activating E-cadherin and repressing Vimentin. Taken together, this study provides the first evidence that neddylation pathway is overactive in ccRCC and that MLN4924 induces dose-dependent anti-proliferation, anti-migration, anti-invasion in ccRCC cells. The study thus indicates that MLN4924 has potential therapeutic value for the clinical treatment of renal cancer.},

abstract = {Deep eutectic solvents (DESs) have been used in the synthesis of nitrogen-doped carbons exhibiting a hierarchical porous structure. The CO 2 sorption capacity of these solid sorbents was extraordinary because of their relatively high nitrogen content and their bimodal porous structure where micropores provide high surface areas (ca. 700 m 2 g -1) and macropores provide accessibility to such a surface. DESs were composed of resorcinol, 3-hydroxypyridine and choline chloride in 2:2:1 and 1:1:1 molar ratios. Polycondensation of resorcinol and 3-hydroxypyridine (with formaldehyde) promoted DES segregation in a spinodal-like decomposition process by the formation of a polymer rich phase and a depleted polymer phase. Thus, DESs played a multiple role in the synthetic process; the liquid medium that ensured reagents homogenization, the structure-directing agent that is responsible for the achievement of the hierarchical structure, and the source of carbon and nitrogen of the solid sorbent obtained after carbonization. Interestingly, the homogeneous incorporation of nitrogen at the solution stage of the synthetic process (rather than by post-treatment of the preformed carbon) allowed the achievement of significant nitrogen contents even in carbons obtained at relatively high temperatures (e.g. 8-12 at{\%} for 600 °C and ca. 5 at{\%} for 800 °C). It is worth noting that, despite thermal treatments at high temperatures tend to decrease the nitrogen content, the high surface area of the solid sorbents obtained at 800 °C contributed to a significant enhancement of CO 2 capture while providing superior selectivity, recyclability and stability. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

abstract = {Metadynamics is a powerful algorithm that can be used both for reconstructing the free energy and for accelerating rare events in systems described by complex Hamiltonians, at the classical or at the quantum level. In the algorithm the normal evolution of the system is biased by a history-dependent potential constructed as a sum of Gaussians centered along the trajectory followed by a suitably chosen set of collective variables. The sum of Gaussians is exploited for reconstructing iteratively an estimator of the free energy and forcing the system to escape from local minima. This review is intended to provide a comprehensive description of the algorithm, with a focus on the practical aspects that need to be addressed when one attempts to apply metadynamics to a new system: (i) the choice of the appropriate set of collective variables; (ii) the optimal choice of the metadynamics parameters and (iii) how to control the error and ensure convergence of the algorithm. {\textcopyright} 2008 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

In the past decade, various approaches have been developed to discover the collective motions associated with this dynamics. The corresponding collective variables are used in many applications, e.g., to understand the reaction mechanism, to quantify the system's free energy landscape, to enhance the sampling of the reaction path, and to determine the reaction rate.

abstract = {Biological membranes composed of lipids and proteins are in contact with electrolytes like aqueous NaCl solutions. Based on molecular dynamics studies it is widely believed that Na+ ions specifically bind to 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC) membranes, whereas Cl- ions stay in solution. Here, we present a careful comparison of recent data from electrophoresis and isothermal titration calorimetry experiments as well as molecular dynamics simulations suggesting that in fact both ions show very similar affinities. The corresponding binding constants are 0.44(±0.05) M-1 for Na+ and 0.40(±0.04) M-1 for Cl- ions. This is highlighted by our observation that a widely used simulation setup showing asymmetric affinities of Na + and Cl- for POPC bilayers overestimates the effect of NaCl on the electrophoretic mobility of a POPC membrane by an order of magnitude. Implications for previous simulation results on the effect of NaCl on polarization of interfacial water, transmembrane potentials, and mechanisms for ion transport through bilayers are discussed. Our findings suggest that a range of published simulations results on the interaction of NaCl with phosphocholine bilayers have to be reconsidered and revised and that force field refinements are necessary for reliable simulation studies of membranes at physiological conditions on a molecular level. {\textcopyright} 2013 Biophysical Society.},

abstract = {The recent cryo-electron microscopy structures of zebrafish and the human cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) provided unprecedented insights into putative mechanisms underlying gating of its anion channel activity. Interestingly, despite predictions based on channel activity measurements in biological membranes, the structure of the detergent purified, phosphorylated, and ATP-bound human CFTR protein did not reveal a stably open conduction pathway. This study tested the hypothesis that the functional properties of the detergent solubilized CFTR protein used for structural determinations are different from those exhibited by CFTR purified under conditions that retain associated lipids native to the membrane. It was found that CFTR purified together with phospholipids and cholesterol using amphipol: A8-35, exhibited higher rates of catalytic activity, phosphorylation dependent channel activation and potentiation by the therapeutic compound, ivacaftor, than did CFTR purified in detergent. The catalytic activity of phosphorylated CFTR detergent micelles was rescued by the addition of phospholipids plus cholesterol, but not by phospholipids alone, arguing for a specific role for cholesterol in modulating this function. In summary, these studies highlight the importance of lipid interactions in the intrinsic activities and pharmacological potentiation of CFTR.},

@article{Vorobyov2010,
abstract = {It was recently demonstrated that significant local deformations of biological membranes take place due to the fields of charged peptides and ions, challenging the standard model of membrane electrostatics. The ability of ions to retain their immediate hydration environment, combined with the lack of sensitivity of permeability to ion type or even ion pairs, led us to question the extent to which hydration energetics and electrostatics control membrane ion permeation. Using the arginine analog methyl-guanidinium as a test case, we find that although hydrocarbon electronic polarizability causes dramatic changes in ion solvation free energy, as well as a significant change (∼0.4 V) in the membrane dipole potential, little change in membrane permeation energetics occurs. We attribute this to compensation of solvation terms from polar and polarizable nonpolar components within the membrane, and explain why the dipole potential is not fully sensed in terms of the locally deformed bilayer interface. Our descriptions provide a deeper understanding of the translocation process and allow predictions for poly-ions, ion pairs, charged lipids, and lipid flip-flop. We also report simulations of large hydrophobic-ion-like membrane defects and the ionophore valinomycin, which exhibit little membrane deformation, as well as hydrophilic defects and the ion channel gramicidin A, to provide parallels to membranes deformed by unassisted ion permeation. {\textcopyright} 2010 by the Biophysical Society.},

abstract = {The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is an unusual ABC transporter, functioning as a chloride channel critical for fluid homeostasis in multiple organs. Disruption of CFTR function is associated with cystic fibrosis making it an attractive therapeutic target. In addition, CFTR blockers are being developed as potential antidiarrheals. CFTR drug discovery is hampered by the lack of high resolution structural data, and considerable efforts have been invested in modeling the channel structure. Although previously published CFTR models that have been made publicly available mostly agree with experimental data relating to the overall structure, they present the channel in an outward-facing conformation that does not agree with expected properties of a "channel-like" structure. Here, we make available a model of CFTR in such a "channel-like" conformation, derived by a unique modeling approach combining restrained homology modeling and ROSETTA refinement. In contrast to others, the present model is in agreement with expected channel properties such as pore shape, dimensions, solvent accessibility, and experimentally derived distances. We have used the model to explore the interaction of open channel blockers within the pore, revealing a common binding mode and ionic interaction with K95, in agreement with experimental data. The binding-site was further validated using a virtual screening enrichment experiment, suggesting the model might be suitable for drug discovery. In addition, we subjected the model to a molecular dynamics simulation, revealing previously unaddressed salt-bridge interactions that may be important for structure stability and pore-lining residues that may take part in Cl - conductance. {\textcopyright} 2012 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {Cystic fibrosis (CF), a lethal monogenic disease, is caused by pathogenic variants of the CFTR chloride channel. The majority of CF mutations affect protein folding and stability leading overall to diminished apical anion conductance of epithelial cells. The recently published cryo-EM structures of full-length human and zebrafish CFTR provide a good model to gain insight into structure–function relationships of CFTR variants. Although, some of the structures were determined in the phosphorylated and ATP-bound active state, none of the static structures showed an open pathway for chloride permeation. Therefore, we performed molecular dynamics simulations to generate a conformational ensemble of the protein and used channel detecting algorithms to identify conformations with an opened channel. Our simulations indicate a main intracellular entry at TM4/6, a secondary pore at TM10/12, and a bottleneck region involving numerous amino acids from TM1, TM6, and TM12 in accordance with experiments. Since chloride ions entered the pathway in our equilibrium simulations, but did not traverse the bottleneck region, we performed metadynamics simulations, which revealed two possible exits. One of the chloride ions exits includes hydrophobic lipid tails that may explain the lipid-dependency of CFTR function. In summary, our in silico study provides a detailed description of a potential chloride channel pathway based on a recent cryo-EM structure and may help to understand the gating of the CFTR chloride channel, thus contributing to novel strategies to rescue dysfunctional mutants.},

VMD can simultaneously display any number of structures using a wide variety of rendering styles and coloring methods. Molecules are displayed as one or more “representations,” in which each representation embodies a particular rendering method and coloring scheme for a selected subset of atoms. The atoms displayed in each representation are chosen using an extensive atom selection syntax, which includes Boolean operators and regular expressions. VMD provides a complete graphical user interface for program control, as well as a text interface using the Tcl embeddable parser to allow for complex scripts with variable substitution, control loops, and function calls. Full session logging is supported, which produces a VMD command script for later playback. High-resolution raster images of displayed molecules may be produced by generating input scripts for use by a number of photorealistic image-rendering applications. VMD has also been expressly designed with the ability to animate molecular dynamics (MD) simulation trajectories, imported either from files or from a direct connection to a running MD simulation. VMD is the visualization component of MDScope, a set of tools for interactive problem solving in structural biology, which also includes the parallel MD program NAMD, and the MDCOMM software used to connect the visualization and simulation programs.

In biological and nanotechnological experiments, methods of extracting and purifying nucleic acids from various types of cells and their storage are critical for obtaining reproducible experimental results. In nanotechnological experiments, methods for regulating the conformational polymorphism of nucleic acids and increasing sequence selectivity for base pairing of nucleic acids are important for developing nucleic acid-based nanomaterials. However, dearth of media that foster favourable behaviour of nucleic acids has been a bottleneck for promoting the biology and nanotechnology using the nucleic acids. Ionic liquids (ILs) are solvents that may be potentially used for controlling the properties of the nucleic acids. Here, we review researches regarding the behaviour of nucleic acids in ILs. The efficiency of extraction and purification of nucleic acids from biological samples is increased by IL addition. Moreover, nucleic acids in ILs show long-term stability, which maintains their structures and enhances nuclease resistance. Nucleic acids in ILs can be used directly in polymerase chain reaction and gene expression analysis with high efficiency. Moreover, the stabilities of the nucleic acids for duplex, triplex, and quadruplex (G-quadruplex and i-motif) structures change drastically with IL cation-nucleic acid interactions. Highly sensitive DNA sensors have been developed based on the unique changes in the stability of nucleic acids in ILs. The behaviours of nucleic acids in ILs detailed here should be useful in the design of nucleic acids to use as biological and nanotechnological tools.},

The structures reveal several interfaces, including a large, specific, Ca2+ -independent and conserved interface. Tests of this interface by mutagenesis suggest that it is essential for Ca2+ -triggered neurotransmitter release in mouse hippocampal neuronal synapses and for Ca2+ -triggered vesicle fusion in a reconstituted system. We propose that this interface forms before Ca2+ triggering, moves en bloc as Ca2+ influx promotes the interactions between synaptotagmin-1 and the plasma membrane, and consequently remodels the membrane to promote fusion, possibly in conjunction with other interfaces.},

abstract = {F{\"{o}}rster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) between fluorescent proteins (FPs) is widely used to construct fluorescent sensor proteins, to study intracellular protein-protein interactions and to monitor conformational changes in multidomain proteins. Although FRET depends strongly on the orientation of the transition dipole moments (TDMs) of the donor and acceptor fluorophores, this orientation dependence is currently not taken into account in FRET sensor design. Similarly, studies that use FRET to derive structural constrains typically assume a $\kappa$2 of 2/3 or use the TDM of green fluorescent protein, as this is the only FP for which the TDM has been determined experimentally. Here we used time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) methods to calculate the TDM for a comprehensive list of commonly used fluorescent proteins. The method was validated against higher levels of calculation. Validation with model compounds and the experimentally determined TDM of GFP shows that the TDM is mostly determined by the structure of the $\pi$-conjugated fluorophore and is insensitive to non-conjugated side chains or the protein surrounding. Our calculations not only provide TDM for most of the currently used FPs, but also suggest an empirical rule that can be used to obtain the TDMs for newly developed fluorescent proteins in the future.

abstract = {Previous studies have identified two salt bridges in human CFTR chloride ion channels, Arg352-Asp993 and Arg347-Asp 924, that are required for normal channel function. In the present study, we determined how the two salt bridges cooperate to maintain the open pore architecture of CFTR. Our data suggest that Arg347 not only interacts with Asp924 but also interacts with Asp993. The tripartite interaction Arg347-Asp924-Asp993 mainly contributes to maintaining a stable s2 open subconductance state. The Arg352-Asp993 salt bridge, in contrast, is involved in stabilizing both the s2 and full (f) open conductance states, with the main contribution being to the f state. The s1 subconductance state does not require either salt bridge. In confirmation of the role of Arg352 and Asp993, channels bearing cysteines at these sites could be latched into a full open state using the bifunctional cross-linker 1,2-ethanediyl bismethanethiosulfonate, but only when applied in the open state. Channels remained latched open even after washout of ATP. The results suggest that these interacting residues contribute differently to stabilizing the open pore in different phases of the gating cycle. {\textcopyright} 2013 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.},

Recent advances in single molecule cryo-EM methods enabled structural determination of full-length human and zebrafish CFTR, achieving an important milestone for CF drug development. To relate these structures to the gating cycle, we examined its dynamic features using molecular dynamics simulations. Our results show that the nucleotide binding domains (NBDs) in this bottom-open apo conformation exhibit motions related to dimerization and the bottom-closed apo CFTR model indicates opening of NBDs in contrast to transporters.

abstract = {The accumulation of intracellular $\beta$-amyloid peptide (A$\beta$) is important pathological characteristic of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the exact underlying molecular mechanism remains to be elucidated. Here, we reported that Nuclear Paraspeckle Assembly Transcript 1 (NEAT1), a long n on-coding RNA, exhibits repressed expression in the early stage of AD and its down-regulation declines neuroglial cell mediating A$\beta$ clearance via inhibiting expression of endocytosis-related genes. We find that NEAT1 is associated with P300/CBP complex and its inhibition affects H3K27 acetylation (H3K27Ac) and H3K27 crotonylation (H3K27Cro) located nearby to the transcription start site of many genes, including endocytosis-related genes. Interestingly, NEAT1 inhibition down-regulates H3K27Ac but up-regulates H3K27Cro through repression of acetyl-CoA generation. NEAT1 also mediates the binding between STAT3 and H3K27Ac but not H3K27Cro. Therefore, the decrease of H3K27Ac and/or the increase of H3K27Cro declines expression of multiple related genes. Collectively, this study first reveals the different roles of H3K27Ac and H3K27Cro in regulation of gene expression and provides the insight of the epigenetic regulatory mechanism of NEAT1 in gene expression and AD pathology.},

abstract = {ATP hydrolysis is a key reaction in living cells that drives many cellular processes. The reaction, which involves gamma phosphate cleavage from ATP, converting it to ADP, has been suggested to occur via an associative or dissociative mechanism dependent upon the surrounding environment. Prior quantum chemical studies suffered from short simulation time scales failing to capture free energy contributions due to relaxation of the surrounding aqueous environment. We have developed a highly parallelized QM/MM implementation in the NAMD and OpenAtom simulation packages, using the dual grid, dual length scale method for combined plane-wave and Euler exponential spline-based QM/MM simulations. This approach, using message-driven parallel quantum and classical dynamics, permits sufficient time scale simulations for quantum chemical events such as ATP hydrolysis and is found to accurately and reliably include the free energy contributions of solvent relaxation to hydrolysis. In this paper, we describe the application of the dual grid, dual length plane-wave-based QM/MM method to study both the associative and dissociative mechanisms of ATP hydrolysis, accounting for the free energy contribution from solvent relaxation, as well as for the key role of Mg 2+ in the reaction. {\textcopyright} 2012 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {Enterobacteriaceae produce antimicrobial peptides for survival under nutrient starvation. Microcin J25 (MccJ25) is an antimicrobial peptide with a unique lasso topology. It is secreted by the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) exporter McjD, which ensures self-immunity of the producing strain through efficient export of the toxic mature peptide from the cell. Here we have determined the crystal structure of McjD from Escherichia coli at 2.7-{\AA} resolution, which is to the authors' knowledge the first structure of an antibacterial peptide ABC transporter. Our functional and biochemical analyses demonstrate McjD-dependent immunity to MccJ25 through efflux of the peptide. McjD can directly bind MccJ25 and displays a basal ATPase activity that is stimulated by MccJ25 in both detergent solution and proteoliposomes. McjD adopts a new conformation, termed nucleotide-bound outward occluded. The new conformation defines a clear cavity; mutagenesis and ligand binding studies of the cavity have identified Phe86, Asn134, and Asn302 as important for recognition of MccJ25. Comparisons with the inward-open MsbA and outward-open Sav1866 structures show that McjD has structural similarities with both states without the intertwining of transmembrane (TM) helices. The occluded state is formed by rotation of TMs 1 and 2 toward the equivalent TMs of the opposite monomer, unlike Sav1866 where they intertwine with TMs 3-6 of the opposite monomer. Cysteine cross-linking studies on the McjD dimer in inside-out membrane vesicles of E. coli confirmed the presence of the occluded state. We therefore propose that the outward-occluded state represents a transition intermediate between the outward-open and inward-open conformation of ABC exporters.},

abstract = {Store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE) is a critical Ca2+ signaling pathway in many cell types. After sensing Ca2+ store depletion in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) lumen, STIM1 (STromal Interaction Molecule 1) oligomerizes and then interacts with and activates the Orai1 calcium channel. Our previous research has demonstrated that the inhibitory helix (IH) adjacent to the first coiled-coil region (CC1) of STIM1 may keep the whole C-terminus of STIM1 in an inactive state. However, the specific conformational change of CC1-IH that drives the transition of STIM1 from the resting state to the active state remains elusive. Herein, we report the structural analysis of CC1-IH, which revealed that the entire CC1-IH molecule forms a very long helix. Structural and biochemical analyses indicated that IH, and not the CC1 region, contributes to the oligomerization of STIM1. Small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) analysis suggested that the C-terminus of STIM1 including the IH region displays a collapsed conformation, whereas the construct without the IH region has an extended conformation. These two conformations may correspond to the conformational states of the C-terminus of STIM1 before and after activation. Taken together, our results provide direct biochemical evidence that the IH region controls the conformational switching of the C-terminus of STIM1. {\textcopyright} 2013 Cui et al.},

abstract = {We present a method to predict complex structural (conformational) transitions in irregular or disordered macromolecular systems, such as proteins or glasses, at the atomic level. Our method aims at rare events, which currently cannot be predicted with traditional molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, since these currently are limited to time scales shorter than a few nanoseconds. Given an initial conformation of the system, our method identifies one or more product states, which may be separated from the initial state by free energy barriers that are large on the scale of thermal energy. It also provides an approximate reaction path, which can be used to determine barrier heights or reaction rates with the usual techniques. The method employs an artificial potential that destabilizes the initial conformation and, thereby, lowers free energy barriers of structural transitions. As a result, transitions are accelerated and may be observed in MD simulations. An analytical estimate for the acceleration factor is given. The method is applied to two test systems, an argon microcluster and a simplified protein model. By these studies we demonstrated that our method is capable of shortening mean transition times from 0.5 s (argon cluster) and 1.4 ns (protein model) to a few picoseconds. These results suggest that our method is particularly well suited to study biochemically relevant conformational motions in proteins at a microsecond time scale. {\textcopyright} 1995 The American Physical Society.},

abstract = {Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) chloride channels are gated by binding and hydrolysis of ATP at the nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs). We used covalent modification of CFTR channels bearing a cysteine engineered at position 334 to investigate changes in pore conformation that might accompany channel gating. In single R334C-CFTR channels studied in excised patches, modification by [2-(trimethylammonium)ethyl] methanethiosulfonate (MTSET+), which increases conductance, occurred only during channel closed states. This suggests that the rate of reaction of the cysteine was greater in closed channels than in open channels. R334C-CFTR channels in outside-out macropatches activated by ATP alone were modified with first order kinetics upon rapid exposure to MTSET+. Modification was much slower when channels were locked open by the addition of nonhydrolyzable nucleotide or when the R334C mutation was coupled to a second mutation, K1250A, which greatly decreases channel closing rate. In contrast, modification was faster in R334C/K464A-CFTR channels, which exhibit prolonged interburst closed states. These data indicate that the reactivity of the engineered cysteine in R334C-CFTR is state-dependent, providing evidence of changes in pore conformation coupled to ATP binding and hydrolysis at the NBDs. The data also show that maneuvers that lock open R334C-CFTR do so by locking channels into the prominent s2 subconductance state, suggesting that the most stable conducting state of the pore reflects the fully occupied, prehydrolytic state of the NBDs. {\textcopyright} 2005 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.},

A recently introduced method of metadynamics allows exploration of the free energy surface of a molecular system by means of coarse-grained dynamics with flooding of free energy minima. This free energy surface is defined as a function of a set of collective variables (e.g., interatomic distances, angles, torsions, and others). In this study, essential coordinates determined by essential dynamics (principle component analysis) were used as collective variables in metadynamics. First, dynamics of the model system (explicitly solvated alanine dipeptide, Ace-Ala-Nme) was simulated by a classical molecular dynamics simulation. The trajectory (1 ns) was then analyzed by essential dynamics to obtain essential coordinates. The free energy surface as a function of the first and second essential coordinates was then explored by metadynamics. The resulting free energy surface is in agreement with other studies of this system. We propose that a combination of these two methods (metadynamics and essential dynamics) has great potential in studies of conformational changes in peptides and proteins. {\textcopyright} 2007 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {In this work, we report the electric-field effects on ionic hydration of Cl-, Na+, and Pb2+ using molecular dynamics simulations. It is found that the effect of weak fields on ionic hydration can be neglected. Strong fields greatly disturb the water orientation in the hydration shells of ions, though ion coordination number remains almost unchanged. Under strong fields, the first hydration shell of ions is significantly weakened and the ion-water interaction energy is dramatically reduced; surprisingly, the second hydration shells of Cl- and Na+ are slightly structured because of the optimal water orientation; moreover, ionic hydration structures become asymmetrical along the field direction because of the uniformly aligned water dipoles. Compared with Na+ and Pb2+, the hydration of Cl- is less disturbed by external fields, probably ascribed to the different water reorientation around anions and cations as well as the different structure-maker/breaker nature of the ions. Additionally, strong fields significantly enhance ion mobility and remarkably shorten the water residence time in the hydration shell. This work demonstrates that applying strong fields is an effective way to weaken ion hydration.},

abstract = {We introduce a toolset of program libraries collectively titled multipurpose atom-typer for CHARMM (MATCH) for the automated assignment of atom types and force field parameters for molecular mechanics simulation of organic molecules. The toolset includes utilities for the conversion of multiple chemical structure file formats into a molecular graph. A general chemical pattern-matching engine using this graph has been implemented whereby assignment of molecular mechanics atom types, charges, and force field parameters are achieved by comparison against a customizable list of chemical fragments. While initially designed to complement the CHARMM simulation package and force fields by generating the necessary input topology and atom-type data files, MATCH can be expanded to any force field and program, and has core functionality that makes it extendable to other applications such as fragment-based property prediction. In this work, we demonstrate the accurate construction of atomic parameters of molecules within each force field included in CHARMM36 through exhaustive cross validation studies illustrating that bond charge increment rules derived from one force field can be transferred to another. In addition, using leave-one-out substitution it is shown that it is also possible to substitute missing intra and intermolecular parameters with ones included in a force field to complete the parameterization of novel molecules. Finally, to demonstrate the robustness of MATCH and the coverage of chemical space offered by the recent CHARMM general force field (Vanommeslaeghe, et al., J Comput Chem 2010, 31, 671), one million molecules from the PubChem database of small molecules are typed, parameterized, and minimized. {\textcopyright} 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract = {Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations can model the interactions between macromolecules with high spatiotemporal resolution but at a high computational cost. By combining high-throughput MD with Markov state models (MSMs), it is now possible to obtain long time-scale behavior of small to intermediate biomolecules and complexes. To model the interactions of many molecules at large length scales, particle-based reaction-diffusion (RD) simulations are more suit⇌able but lack molecular detail. Thus, coupling MSMs and RD simulations (MSM/RD) would be highly desirable, as they could efficiently produce simulations at large time and length scales, while still conserving the characteristic features of the interactions observed at atomic detail. While such a coupling seems straightforward, fundamental questions are still open: Which definition of MSM states is suitable? Which protocol to merge and split RD particles in an association/dissociation reaction will conserve the correct bimolecular kinetics and thermodynamics? In this paper, we make the first step toward MSM/RD by laying out a general theory of coupling and proposing a first implementation for association/dissociation of a protein with a small ligand (A + B ⇌ C). Applications on a toy model and CO diffusion into the heme cavity of myoglobin are reported.},

Our molecular dynamics simulation study revealed that A171T transition brought remarkable conformational changes in enzyme structure (open ATP binding pocket), which reduced the interaction between MLN4924 and ATP binding pocket while wild form completely covered the MLN4924. A total difference of -49.75 kJ/mol was noticed in interaction energy (electrostatic and van der Waals) during simulation between mutant and wild form with MLN4924. Superimposition of final 20 ns mutant structure with reference structure showed significant change in native binding position as compared to wild form.

abstract = {Cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) is widely used to study biological macromolecules that comprise regions with disorder, flexibility or partial occupancy. For example, membrane proteins are often kept in solution with detergent micelles and lipid nanodiscs that are locally disordered. Such spatial variability negatively impacts computational three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction with existing iterative refinement algorithms that assume rigidity. We introduce non-uniform refinement, an algorithm based on cross-validation optimization, which automatically regularizes 3D density maps during refinement to account for spatial variability. Unlike common shift-invariant regularizers, non-uniform refinement systematically removes noise from disordered regions, while retaining signal useful for aligning particle images, yielding dramatically improved resolution and 3D map quality in many cases. We obtain high-resolution reconstructions for multiple membrane proteins as small as 100 kDa, demonstrating increased effectiveness of cryo-EM for this class of targets critical in structural biology and drug discovery. Non-uniform refinement is implemented in the cryoSPARC software package.},

abstract = {Analysis of molecular dynamics, for example using Markov models, often requires the identification of order parameters that are good indicators of the rare events, i.e. good reaction coordinates. Recently, it has been shown that the time-lagged independent component analysis (TICA) finds the linear combinations of input coordinates that optimally represent the slow kinetic modes and may serve in order to define reaction coordinates between the metastable states of the molecular system. A limitation of the method is that both computing time and memory requirements scale with the square of the number of input features. For large protein systems, this exacerbates the use of extensive feature sets such as the distances between all pairs of residues or even heavy atoms. Here we derive a hierarchical TICA (hTICA) method that approximates the full TICA solution by a hierarchical, divide-and-conquer calculation. By using hTICA on distances between heavy atoms we identify previously unknown relaxation processes in the bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor.},

Coarse-grained simulations yield a 2D density landscape for PH/membrane interactions alongside residue contact profiles. Predictions of the membrane localization and interactions of 13 PH domains reveal canonical, non-canonical, and dual PIP-binding sites on the proteins. Thus, the PH domains associate with the PIP molecules in the membrane via a highly positively charged loop. Some PH domains exhibit modes of interaction with PIP-containing membranes additional to this canonical binding mode. All 13 PH domains cause a degree of local clustering of PIP molecules upon binding to the membrane. This provides a global picture of PH domain interactions with membranes. The high-throughput approach could be extended to other families of peripheral membrane proteins.},

Orai1, which represents the subunit forming the CRAC channel complex, is activated by the ER resident Ca2+ sensor STIM1. The genetically inherited Stormorken syndrome disease has been associated with the STIM1 single point R304W mutant. The resulting constitutive activation of Orai1 mainly involves the CRAC-activating domain CAD/SOAR of STIM1, the exposure of which is regulated by the molecular interplay between three cytosolic STIM1 coiled-coil (CC) domains. Here we present a dual mechanism by which STIM1 R304W attains the pathophysiological, constitutive activity eliciting the Stormorken syndrome. The R304W mutation induces a helical elongation within the CC1 domain, which together with an increased CC1 homomerization, destabilize the resting state of STIM1. This culminates, even in the absence of store depletion, in structural extension and CAD/SOAR exposure of STIM1 R304W leading to constitutive CRAC channel activation and Stormorken disease.},

abstract = {We have developed a simple and quantitative explanation for the relatively low melting temperatures of ionic liquids (ILs). The basic concept was to assess the Gibbs free energy of fusion ($\Delta$fusG) for the process IL(S) → IL(l), which relates to the melting point of the IL. This was done using a suitable Born-Fajans-Haber cycle that was closed by the lattice (i.e., IL(S) → IL(g)) Gibbs energy and the solvation (i.e., IL(g) → IL(l)) Gibbs energies of the constituent ions in the molten salt. As part of this project we synthesized and determined accurate melting points (by DSC) and dielectric constants (by dielectric spectroscopy) for 14 ionic liquids based on four common anions and nine common cations. Lattice free energies ($\Delta$lattG) were estimated using a combination of Volume Based Thermodynamics (VBT) and quantum chemical calculations. Free energies of solvation ($\Delta$ SOlVG) of each ion in the bulk molten salt were calculated using the COSMO solvation model and the experimental dielectric constants. Under standard ambient conditions (298.15 K and 10s Pa) $\Delta$fusG° was found to be negative for all the ILs studied, as expected for liquid samples. Thus, these ILs are liquid under standard ambient conditions because the liquid state is thermodynamically favorable, due to the large size and conformational flexibility of the ions involved, which leads to small lattice enthalpies and large entropy changes that favor melting. This model can be used to predict the melting temperatures and dielectric constants of ILs with good accuracy. A comparison of the predicted vs experimental melting points for nine of the ILs (excluding those where no melting transition was observed and two outliers that were not well described by the model) gave a standard error of the estimate (sest) of 8 °C. A similar comparison for dielectric constant predictions gave sest as 2.5 units. Thus, from very little experimental and computational data it is possible to predict fundamental properties such as melting points and dielectric constants of ionic liquids. {\textcopyright} 2006 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {Whether an ionic liquid (IL) is water-miscible or immiscible depends on the particular ions that constitute it. We propose an explanation, based on molecular simulations, how ions determine the miscibility of ILs and suggest a straightforward and computationally inexpensive method to predict the miscibility of arbitrary new ILs. The influence of ions on the solvation of water is analyzed by comparing molecular dynamics simulations of water in 9 different ILs with varying cation and anion constituents. The solvation of water in ILs is found to depend primarily on the electrostatic water-ion interaction strength, which, in turn, is determined mainly by two factors: primarily, by the size of the ions and secondarily by the amount of charge on the ion surface that is coordinated with water. It is demonstrated that large ions lead to weaker interactions with water, due to the involved delocalization of the ion charge. A large charge on the ion surface, which is determined by the chemical structure of the ion, strengthens water-ion interactions. We observe that whenever the interaction strength of water with ions exceeds a certain threshold, an IL becomes water-miscible. On the basis of these findings, a simple equation is derived that estimates the water-ion interaction strength. With this equation it is possible to predict most of the observed water-miscibilities of a sample of 83 ILs correctly. A linear increase of the water saturation concentration with the estimated water-ion interaction strength is observed in waterimmiscible ILs, which can be utilized to predict the water concentration in new ILs. {\textcopyright} 2010 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator forms an anion- selective channel. We previously showed that charge selectivity, the ability to discriminate between anions and cations, occurs near the cytoplasmic end of the channel. The molecular determinants of charge selectivity, however, are unknown. We investigated the role of Arg352, a residue flanking the predicted cytoplasmic end of the M6 segment, in the mechanism of charge selectivity. We determined the Cl- to Na+ permeability ratio (P(Cl)/P(Na)) from the reversal potential measured in a 10-fold NaCl gradient. For the wild type, P(Cl)/P(Na) was 36 (range of 28-51). For the R352H mutant, P(Cl)/P(Na) was dependent on cytoplasmic pH. At pH 5.4, the P(Cl)/P(Na) was 33 (range of 27-41), similar to that of the wild type, but at pH 7.2, where the histidine should be largely uncharged, P(Cl)/P(Na) was 3 (range of 2.9-3.1). For the R352C and R352Q mutants, P(Cl)/P(Na) was 7 (range of 6-8) and 4 (range of 3.5-4.4), respectively. Furthermore, Na+ which does not carry a significant fraction of the current through the wild type is measurably conducted through R352Q. Thus, the charge of the side chain at position 352 is a strong determinant of charge selectivity. In the wild type, the positive charge on Arg352 contributes to an electrostatic potential in the channel that forms a barrier to cation permeation. Mutation of Arg352 did not alter the halide selectivity sequence. Selectivity among halides must involve other residues.},

abstract = {The performance of all-atom molecular dynamics simulations is limited by an integration time step of 2 fs, which is needed to resolve the fastest degrees of freedom in the system, namely, the vibration of bonds and angles involving hydrogen atoms. The virtual interaction sites (VIS) method replaces hydrogen atoms by massless virtual interaction sites to eliminate these degrees of freedom while keeping intact nonbonded interactions and the explicit treatment of hydrogen atoms. We have modified the existing VIS algorithm for most lipids in the popular CHARMM36 force field by increasing the hydrogen atom masses at regular intervals in the lipid acyl chains and obtained lipid properties and pore formation free energies in very good agreement with those calculated in simulations without VIS. Our modified VIS scheme enables a 5 fs time step resulting in a significant performance gain for all-atom simulations of membranes. The method has the potential to make longer time and length scales accessible in all-atom simulations of membrane-protein complexes.},

We used Madin-Darby canine kidney cells as a model for epithelium formation and investigated the remodeling of the total cell membrane lipidome during the transition from a nonpolarized morphology to an epithelial morphology and vice versa. To achieve this, we developed a shotgun-based lipidomics workflow that enabled the absolute quantification of mammalian membrane lipidomes with minimal sample processing from low sample amounts. Epithelial morphogenesis was accompanied by a major shift from sphingomyelin to glycosphingolipid, together with an increase in plasmalogen, phosphatidylethanolamine, and cholesterol content, whereas the opposite changes took place during an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. Moreover, during polarization, the sphingolipids became longer, more saturated, and more hydroxylated as required to generate an apical membrane domain that serves as a protective barrier for the epithelial sheet.},

CFTR channel gating is strictly coupled to phosphorylation and ATP hydrolysis. Previously, we reported essentially identical structures of zebrafish and human CFTR in the dephosphorylated, ATP-free form. Here, we present the structure of zebrafish CFTR in the phosphorylated, ATP-bound conformation, determined by cryoelectron microscopy to 3.4 {\AA} resolution. Comparison of the two conformations shows major structural rearrangements leading to channel opening. The phosphorylated regulatory domain is disengaged from its inhibitory position; the nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs) form a “head-to-tail” dimer upon binding ATP; and the cytoplasmic pathway, found closed off in other ATP-binding cassette transporters, is cracked open, consistent with CFTR's unique channel function. Unexpectedly, the extracellular mouth of the ion pore remains closed, indicating that local movements of the transmembrane helices can control ion access to the pore even in the NBD-dimerized conformation.},

abstract = {Although protein based therapeutics is the fastest growing sector of the pharmaceutical industry, production costs remain incredibly high and rapid commercialization of new protein drug candidates are not being fully realized due to the presence of many barriers, namely the physical and chemical instabilities of proteins. Of these degradation pathways, protein aggregation is arguably the most common and troubling manifestation of protein instability, occurring in almost all phases of development. Protein aggregates are usually nonnative in structure, may exhibit reduced biological activity, and can remain soluble and/or precipitate from solution. In addition to reducing efficacy, if administered to a patient, aggregates can cause adverse reactions, such as immune response, sensitization, or even anaphylactic shock. Therefore, if even a small amount of aggregates form during formulation or storage, a product can be rendered unacceptable. Moreover, for the practical application of traditional and novel drug delivery techniques, protein based therapeutics must be formulated at relatively high concentrations and must remain stable for extended periods of time. The structural differences among various proteins are so significant, that the application of a universal stabilization strategy has not yet been successful, though the effects of common excipients are generally universal. The current approach toward stabilizing protein drugs against aggregation is by trial-and-error testing of different combinations of cosolutes (e.g. salts, sugars, surfactants, amino acids, etc.) using empirically derived heuristics. While ubiquitously used, this approach is inefficient and does not always enable the discovery of stable protein solution formulations. In response to this major problem, we have developed and tested a new class of excipients that has the potential for wide spread application as a universal stabilizer of protein therapeutics. When compared to other commonly used excipients, our novel excipients offer more than an order of magnitude improvement at suppressing the aggregation of a model protein. As a result, if used in formulations, the shelf life of a protein drug, at room or refrigerated temperatures, may be extended from a few weeks to several months or years. Furthermore, these excipients will likely be useful during production and purification for improving yield and lowering downstream purification costs.},

In agreement with the experiments that demonstrate the influence of electrostatic potential on the thrombin/aptamer complex, our computations show that the application of positive electric field successfully unbinds the thrombin from the aptamer. Results from umbrella sampling simulations reveal that there is a decrease in the free energy of binding between the thrombin and aptamer in presence of positive electric fields. Hydrogen bonding and non-bonded interaction energies, and hence the free energy of binding, between the thrombin and its aptamer reduce as the applied electric field is shifted from negative to positive values. Our analyses demonstrate that application of electrical stimulus modifies the molecular interactions within the complex and consequently, electrical field can be used to modulate the association between the thrombin and its aptamer.},

abstract = {The binding of zinc (Zn) ions to proteins is important for many cellular events. The theoretical and computational description of this binding (as well as that of other transition metals) is a challenging task. In this paper the binding of the Zn ion to four cysteine residues in the structural site of horse liver alcohol dehydrogenase (HLADH) is studied using a synthetic peptide mimic of this site. The study includes experimental measurements of binding constants, classical free energy calculations from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and quantum mechanical (QM) electron structure calculations. The classical MD results account for interactions at the molecular level and reproduce the absolute binding energy and the hydration free energy of the Zn ion with an accuracy of about 10{\%}. This is insufficient to obtain correct free energy differences. QM correction terms were calculated from density functional theory (DFT) on small clusters of atoms to include electronic polarisation of the closest waters and covalent contributions to the Zn-S coordination bond. This results in reasonably good agreement with the experimentally measured binding constants and Zn ion hydration free energies in agreement with published experimental values. The study also includes the replacement of one cysteine residue to an alanine. Simulations as well as experiments showed only a small effect of this upon the binding free energy. A detailed analysis indicate that the sulfur is replaced by three water molecules, thereby changing the coordination number of Zn from four (as in the original peptide) to six (as in water). {\textcopyright} the Owner Societies.},

abstract = {Deep eutectic solvents (DESs) have shown potential as promising environmentally friendly alternatives to conventional solvents. Many common and popular DESs are obtained by simply mixing a salt and a H-bond donor. Properties of such a DES depend on its constituents. Change in temperature and addition of water, a benign cosolvent, can change the physicochemical properties of DESs. The effect of changing temperature and addition of water on solvatochromic probe behavior within three DESs formed from choline chloride combined with 1,2-ethanediol, glycerol, and urea, respectively, in 1:2 mol ratios termed ethaline, glyceline, and reline is presented. Increase in temperature results in reduced H-bond donating acidity of the DESs. Dipolarity/polarizability and H-bond accepting basicity do not change with changing temperature of the DESs. The response of the fluorescence probe pyrene also indicates a decrease in the polarity of the DESs as temperature is increased. Addition of water to DES results in increased dipolarity/polarizability and a decrease in H-bond accepting basicity. Except for pyrene, solvatochromic probes exhibit responses close to those predicted from ideal-additive behavior with slight preferential solvation by DES within the aqueous mixtures. Pyrene response reveals significant preferential solvation by DES and/or the presence of solvent-solvent interactions, especially within aqueous mixtures of ethaline and glyceline, the DESs constituted of H-bond donors with hydroxyl functionalities. FTIR absorbance and Raman spectroscopic measurements of aqueous DES mixtures support the outcomes from solvatochromic probe responses. Aqueous mixtures of ethaline and glyceline possess relatively more interspecies H-bonds as compared to aqueous mixtures of reline, where interstitial accommodation of water within the reline molecular network appears to dominate.

abstract = {Many biological processes are based on molecular recognition between highly charged molecules such as nucleic acids, inorganic ions, charged amino acids, etc. For such cases, it has been demonstrated that molecular simulations with fixed partial charges often fail to achieve experimental accuracy. Although incorporation of more advanced electrostatic models (such as multipoles, mutual polarization, etc.) can significantly improve simulation accuracy, it increases computational expense by a factor of 5-20×. Indirect free energy (IFE) methods can mitigate this cost by modeling intermediate states at fixed-charge resolution. For example, an efficient "reference" model such as a pairwise Amber, CHARMM, or OPLS-AA force field can be used to derive an initial estimate, followed by thermodynamic corrections to a more advanced "target" potential such as the polarizable AMOEBA model. Unfortunately, all currently described IFE methods encounter difficulties reweighting more than ∼50 atoms between resolutions due to extensive scaling of both the magnitude of the thermodynamic corrections and their statistical uncertainty. We present an approach called "simultaneous bookending" (SB) that is fundamentally different from existing IFE methods based on a tunable sampling approximation, which permits scaling to thousands of atoms. SB is demonstrated on the relative binding affinity of Mg2+/Ca2+ to a set of metalloproteins with up to 2972 atoms, finding no statistically significant difference between direct AMOEBA results and those from correcting Amber to AMOEBA. The ability to change the resolution of thousands of atoms during reweighting suggests the approach may be applicable in the future to protein-protein binding affinities or nucleic acid thermodynamics.},

abstract = {Amyloid deposits of A$\beta$ protein in neuronal cells are known to be a major symptom of Alzheimer's disease. In particular, A$\beta$42 shows relatively high toxicity among the different A$\beta$ isoforms, and its toxicity is thought to be because of its structural features. Recent ssNMR and cryo-EM experiments identified that A$\beta$42 shows an S-shaped triple-$\beta$ structure, in contrast to the previously suggested U-shaped $\beta$-arch structure. In order to associate the high toxicity of A$\beta$42 with its structural features, it is essential to explain the conformational stability and aggregation mechanisms of this triple-$\beta$ motif. We utilized several different simulation methods, including extensive straight molecular dynamics simulation, steered molecular dynamics simulation, and replica-exchange molecular dynamics simulation. The S-shaped triple-$\beta$ motif showed remarkable structural stability because of its complex residual interactions that form stable hydrophobic cores. The triple-$\beta$ structure of A$\beta$42 is primarily made up of three $\beta$-sheet regions and two hydrophobic cores formed between $\beta$-sheet regions. Our analysis of $\beta$-sheet rupture patterns between adjacent chains showed that its two hydrophobic cores have different degrees of stability, indicating a lock phase mechanism. Our analysis of the docking pathway of monomeric A$\beta$42 to the fibril motif using REMD simulations showed that each of the three $\beta$-sheet sequences plays a distinct role in the docking process by changing their conformational features. Our results provide an understanding for the stability and consequent high toxicity of the triple-$\beta$ structure A$\beta$42},

We here revisited function and folding of some class-IV mutants and discovered that R347P is the only one that leads to major defects in folding. By this criterion and by its functional response to corrector drug VX-809, R347P qualifies also as a class-II mutation. Other class-IV mutants folded like wild-type CFTR and responded similarly to VX-809, demonstrating how function and folding are connected. Studies on both types of defects complement each other in understanding how compounds improve mutant CFTR function.

abstract = {Efficient endocytosis of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is mediated by a tyrosine-based internalization signal in the CFTR carboxyl-terminal tail 1424YDSI1427. In the present studies, two naturally occurring cystic fibrosis mutations in the amino terminus of CFTR, R31C, and R31L were examined. To determine the defect that these mutations cause, the Arg-31 mutants were expressed in COS-7 cells and their biogenesis and trafficking to the cell surface tested in metabolic pulse-chase and surface biotinylation assays, respectively. The results indicated that both Arg-31 mutants were processed to band C at ∼50{\%} the efficiency of the wild-type protein. However, once processed and delivered to the cell surface, their half-lives were the same as wildtype protein. Interestingly, indirect immunofluorescence and cell surface biotinylation indicated that the surface pool was much smaller than could be accounted for based on the biogenesis defect alone. Therefore, the Arg-31 mutants were tested in internalization assays and found to be internalized at 2x the rate of the wild-type protein. Patch clamp and 6-methoxy-N-(3-sulfopropyl)quinolinium analysis confirmed reduced amounts of functional Arg-31 channels at the cell surface. Together, the results suggest that both R31C and R31L mutations compromise biogenesis and enhance internalization of CFTR. These two additive effects contribute to the loss of surface expression and the associated defect in chloride conductance that is consistent with a disease phenotype. {\textcopyright} 2006 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.},

abstract = {Ionic liquids (ILs) have been extensively assessed in biotransformations with different purposes, for example, non-conventional (co-)solvents, performance additives, coating agents for immobilizing/stabilizing enzymes, and IL-membrane-based processes. Fuelled by their premature labelling as 'green solvents', academic research has flourished. However, in recent years environmental aspects related to ILs have been strongly addressed, stating that many ILs commonly used cannot be regarded as 'green derivatives'. Likewise, ILs costs are still a barrier for practical uses. Attempting to combine sustainability with the promising added-values of ILs, the third generation of ILs is currently under development. Likewise, deep-eutectic-solvents (DESs) appear in the horizon as an attractive and cost-effective option for using ionic solvents in biotransformations. DESs are often produced by gently warming and stirring two (bio-based and cheap) salts (e.g. choline chloride and urea). First successful uses of DES in biotransformations were reported recently. It may be expected that knowledge accumulated in (second generation) ILs and biotransformations could be turned into real applications by using these DESs, and third generation ILs, in the coming years. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Viruses are intracellular parasites that hijack the cellular machinery for their own replication. Therefore, an obligatory step in the virus life cycle is the delivery of the viral genome inside the cell. Enveloped viruses (i.e., viruses with a lipid envelope) use a two-step procedure to release their genetic material into the cell: (i) they first bind to specific surface receptors of the target cell membrane and then, (ii) they fuse the viral and cell membranes. This last step may occur at the cell surface or after internalization of the virus particle by endocytosis or by some other route (e.g., macropinocytosis). Remarkably, the virus-cell membrane fusion process goes essentially along the same intermediate steps as other membrane fusions that occur for instance in vesicular fusion at the nerve synapsis or cell-cell fusion in yeast mating. Specialized viral proteins, fusogens, promote virus-cell membrane fusion. The viral fusogens experience drastic structural rearrangements during fusion, liberating the energy required to overcome the repulsive forces that prevent spontaneous fusion of the two membranes. This chapter describes the different types of viral fusogens and their mode of action, as are currently known.},

abstract = {Guanidinium hydrochloride (GuHCl) at low concentrations significantly stabilizes the Fyn SH3 domain. In this work, we have demonstrated that this stabilizing effect is manifested through a dramatic (five- to sixfold) decrease in the unfolding rate of the domain with the folding rate being affected minimally. This behavior contrasts to the effect of NaCl, which stabilizes this domain by accelerating the folding rate. These data imply that the stabilizing effect of GuHCl is not predominantly ionic in nature. Through NMR studies, we have identified a specific binding site for guanidinium, and we have determined a dissociation constant of 90 mM for this interaction. The guanidinium-binding site overlaps with a functionally important arginine-binding pocket on the domain surface, and we have shown that GuHCl is a specific inhibitor of the peptide-binding activity of the domain. A different SH3 domain possessing a similar arginine-binding pocket is also thermodynamically stabilized by GuHCl. These data suggest that many proteins that normally interact with arginine-containing ligands may also be able to specifically interact with guanidinium. Thus, some caution should be used when using GuHCl as a denaturant in protein folding studies. Since arginine-mediated interactions are often important in the energetics of protein-protein interactions, our observations could be relevant for the design of small molecule inhibitors of protein-protein interactions.

abstract = {The application of five water-soluble, halogen-free, alkylammonium-based ionic liquids (ILs) as additives for advanced crystallization of lysozyme was investigated. Their biocompatibility was determined by long-term measurement of the overall mean relative enzyme activities. These were maximally reduced by about 10-15{\%} when up to 200 g IL l-1 was added. Sitting-drop vapor diffusion crystallization experiments revealed that the addition of some of the ILs led to less crystal polymorphism and precipitation was avoided reliably even at larger NaCl concentrations. The addition of ILs tended to result in larger crystals. The kinetics of lysozyme crystallization were significantly enhanced using ILs as crystallization additives, e.g. by a factor of 5.5 when 100 g ethanolammonium formate l-1 was added. ILs with "soft" anions, such as formate or glycolate, were superior to ILs with "hard" anions, like nitrate. {\textcopyright} 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract = {The Ten Commandments (Exodus 20) accept slavery, and Deuteronomy 22 requires a single female who has been raped to marry her rapist. Biblical laws, including these two examples, continue to influence Christian (especially Protestant) attitudes toward women, homosexuals, the poor, as well as those who are from different faiths or racial/ethnic origins. This book argues that such ancient laws and the corresponding contemporary attitudes ignore the harm caused to such groups and fail to consider that these groups may have different, yet valid, perspectives on the meaning of these texts. Specifically, this book argues that the Christian tradition has become inseparable from a privileged male perspective not reflecting the full range of persons found in its faith communities. Furthermore, it is this male norm that has historically established the accepted singular and determinative meaning of any given biblical text. Contemporary controversies about biblical interpretation, then, result from those other groups acknowledging that their realities differ from the putative norm and offering their own interpretations of problematic biblical texts. The book finds that inclusive biblical interpretation and its consideration of these normally excluded perspectives are consistent with the Christian tradition. This work advances support for inclusive interpretation from the Bible (both Old and New Testaments)-from the Protestant tradition itself, based on the writings of Martin Luther, John Calvin, and John Wesley-and from parallels with the interpretation and amendment of the U.S. Constitution.},

abstract = {Genetic variants that inactivate protein-coding genes are a powerful source of information about the phenotypic consequences of gene disruption: genes that are crucial for the function of an organism will be depleted of such variants in natural populations, whereas non-essential genes will tolerate their accumulation. However, predicted loss-of-function variants are enriched for annotation errors, and tend to be found at extremely low frequencies, so their analysis requires careful variant annotation and very large sample sizes1. Here we describe the aggregation of 125,748 exomes and 15,708 genomes from human sequencing studies into the Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD). We identify 443,769 high-confidence predicted loss-of-function variants in this cohort after filtering for artefacts caused by sequencing and annotation errors. Using an improved model of human mutation rates, we classify human protein-coding genes along a spectrum that represents tolerance to inactivation, validate this classification using data from model organisms and engineered human cells, and show that it can be used to improve the power of gene discovery for both common and rare diseases.},

The most common mutation, deletion of phenylalanine 508 ($\Delta$F508), impairs CFTR folding and, consequently, its biosynthetic and endocytic processing as well as chloride channel function. Pharmacological treatments may target the $\Delta$F508 CFTR structural defect directly by binding to the mutant protein and/or indirectly by altering cellular protein homeostasis (proteostasis) to promote $\Delta$F508 CFTR plasma membrane targeting and stability.

In this work and based on our previous predictions, tetrabutylammonium bromide + ethylene glycol and tetrabutylphosphonium bromide + ethylene glycol DESs at molar ratio 1:2 were explored experimentally for the removal of pyrrole, pyridine, indoline and quinoline from a model diesel compound, n-hexadecane. Ternary (liquid + liquid) equilibrium experiments were conducted at room temperature with nitrogen concentrations in the feed ranging from (5 to 50) wt{\%}. 1H NMR spectroscopy was used for compositional analysis of the extract and raffinate phases. No amount of the solvent in the raffinate phases was detected; indicating minimal cross contamination. Also, it was found that all systems exhibit Type I phase behavior with positive slopes which indicate that small amount of solvents is required to remove the nitrogen compounds. Moreover, the distribution ratio and selectivity values are all greater than unity with higher values reported for non-basic nitrogen compounds. COSMO-RS predictions of the ternary tie lines were in good agreement with experimental data with average RMSD value of 2.51{\%}. The experimental data were also well correlated with NRTL model with average RMSD value of 0.60{\%}.},

abstract = {[Abstract] Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have become one of the most important tools in understanding the behavior of bio-molecules on nanosecond to microsecond time scales. In this protocol, we provide a general approach and standard setup protocol for MD simulations by using the Gromacs MD suite. [Background] While molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are increasingly getting popular in studying protein dynamics in silico, there is a strong need to correlate the results with experimental observations. It is necessary that the protein model and the chosen environment for the simulations should mimic the native environment as close as possible. In general, there are three key stages in molecular dynamics simulations: Setup, production run, and analysis of the trajectories. The setup includes the input structures, parameters, force-fields and topologies. However, the readymade setup and wrong parameters could adversely affect the outcome making a false assessment of the biological interpretation. In view of a manual setup as a better choice to setup simulations, we through this protocol, provide a general approach and standard setup protocol for MD simulations. Many online/offline tools are available to perform MD simulations. One amongst the open source tools is Gromacs (Abraham et al., 2015; Pronk et al., 2013; Van der Spoel et al.,2005), a robust and popular MD simulations suite available today which supports almost all the major force fields. In this protocol we also refer to simulations of membrane proteins previously performed in vacuum as a temporary alternative to simulations including the membrane.},

It is proposed that this pressure helps driving the genome into the host, but other mechanisms also seem to play an important role in ejection. DNA packaging and ejection strategies are obviously dependent on the mechanical properties of the capsid. This review focuses on the mechanical properties of viral capsids in general and the elucidation of the biophysical aspects of genome packaging mechanisms and genome delivery processes of double-stranded DNA bacteriophages in particular. {\textcopyright} 2007 Birkh{\"{a}}user Verlag.},

abstract = {Protein structure prediction can be used to determine the three-dimensional shape of a protein from its amino acid sequence1. This problem is of fundamental importance as the structure of a protein largely determines its function2; however, protein structures can be difficult to determine experimentally. Considerable progress has recently been made by leveraging genetic information. It is possible to infer which amino acid residues are in contact by analysing covariation in homologous sequences, which aids in the prediction of protein structures3. Here we show that we can train a neural network to make accurate predictions of the distances between pairs of residues, which convey more information about the structure than contact predictions. Using this information, we construct a potential of mean force4 that can accurately describe the shape of a protein. We find that the resulting potential can be optimized by a simple gradient descent algorithm to generate structures without complex sampling procedures. The resulting system, named AlphaFold, achieves high accuracy, even for sequences with fewer homologous sequences. In the recent Critical Assessment of Protein Structure Prediction5 (CASP13)—a blind assessment of the state of the field—AlphaFold created high-accuracy structures (with template modelling (TM) scores6 of 0.7 or higher) for 24 out of 43 free modelling domains, whereas the next best method, which used sampling and contact information, achieved such accuracy for only 14 out of 43 domains. AlphaFold represents a considerable advance in protein-structure prediction. We expect this increased accuracy to enable insights into the function and malfunction of proteins, especially in cases for which no structures for homologous proteins have been experimentally determined7.},

The nanostructured Ni films possess face-centered cubic crystal structure. Amazingly, it is found that the electrodeposited Ni films deliver the superhydrophobic surfaces without any further modifications by low surface-energy materials, which might be attributed to the vigorous micro/nanobinary architectures and the surface chemical composition.

abstract = {Amyloid formation by the intrinsically disordered $\alpha$-synuclein protein is the hallmark of Parkinson's disease. We present atomistic Molecular Dynamics simulations of the core of $\alpha$-synuclein using enhanced sampling techniques to describe the conformational and binding free energy landscapes of fragments implicated in fibril stabilization. The theoretical framework is derived to combine the free energy profiles of the fragments into the reaction free energy of a protein binding to a fibril. Our study shows that individual fragments in solution have a propensity toward attaining non-$\beta$ conformations, indicating that in a fibril $\beta$-strands are stabilized by interactions with other strands. We show that most dimers of hydrogen-bonded fragments are unstable in solution, while hydrogen bonding stabilizes the collective binding of five fragments to the end of a fibril. Hydrophobic effects make further contributions to the stability of fibrils. This study is the first of its kind where structural and binding preferences of the five major fragments of the hydrophobic core of $\alpha$-synuclein have been investigated. This approach improves sampling of intrinsically disordered proteins, provides information on the binding mechanism between the core sequences of $\alpha$-synuclein, and enables the parametrization of coarse grained models.},

abstract = {A theoretical framework is elaborated to account for the effect of a transmembrane potential in computer simulations. It is shown that a simulation with a constant external electric field applied in the direction normal to the membrane is equivalent to the influence of surrounding infinite baths maintained to a voltage difference via ion-exchanging electrodes connected to an electromotive force. It is also shown that the linearly-weighted displacement charge within the simulation system tracks the net flow of charge through the external circuit comprising the electromotive force and the electrodes. Using a statistical mechanical reduction of the degrees of freedom of the external system, three distinct theoretical routes are formulated and examined for the purpose of characterizing the free energy of a protein embedded in a membrane that is submitted to a voltage difference. The W-route is constructed from the variations in the voltage-dependent potential of mean force along a reaction path connecting two conformations of the protein. The Q-route is based on the average displacement charge as a function of the conformation of the protein. Finally, the G-route considers the relative charging free energy of specific residues, with and without applied membrane potentials. The theoretical formulation is illustrated with a simple model of an ion crossing a vacuum slab surrounded by two aqueous bulk phases and with a fragment of the voltage-sensor of the KvAP potassium channel. {\textcopyright} 2008 by the Biophysical Society.},

MD simulations of biological molecules have become an important tool to elucidate the relationship between molecular structure and physiological function. Simulations are performed with highly optimized software packages on HPC resources but most codes generate output trajectories in their own formats so that the development of new trajectory analysis algorithms is confined to specific user communities and widespread adoption and further development is delayed. MDAnalysis addresses this problem by abstracting access to the raw simulation data and presenting a uniform object-oriented Python interface to the user. It thus enables users to rapidly write code that is portable and immediately usable in virtually all biomolecular simulation communities. The user interface and modular design work equally well in complex scripted work flows, as foundations for other packages, and for interactive and rapid prototyping work in IPython / Jupyter notebooks, especially together with molecular visualization provided by nglview and time series analysis with pandas. MDAnalysis is written in Python and Cython and uses NumPy arrays for easy interoperability with the wider scientific Python ecosystem. It is widely used and forms the foundation for more specialized biomolecular simulation tools. MDAnalysis is available under the GNU General Public License v2.},

The imprinted microspheres made with IL could obtain the good recognition ability to template protein, whereas the imprinted polymer synthesized in the absence of it had a similar adsorption capacity to the non-imprinted one. Furthermore, the preparation conditions of imprinted polymers (MIPs) including the content of IL, temperature of polymerization, and types of functional monomers and crosslinkers were systematically analyzed via circular dichroism spectrum and activity assay. The results illustrated that using hydroxyethyl acrylate as the functional monomer, ethylene glycol dimethacrylate as the crosslinker, 5 {\%} IL as the stabilizer, and 75°C as the reaction temperature could retain the structure of template protein as much as possible. The obtained MIPs showed excellent recognition ability to the template protein with the separation factor and selectivity factor value of 4.30 and 2.21, respectively. Consequently, it is an effective way to accurately imprint and separate template protein by cooperatively using circular dichroism spectroscopy and activity assay during the preparation of protein MIPs. The method of utilizing IL to stabilizing protein at high temperature would offer a good opportunity for various technologies to improve the development of macromolecules imprinting.},

Ab initio molecular dynamics simulations of reline, a mixture consisting of urea and choline chloride, reveal that not solely hydrogen bonds allow similar interactions between both constituents. The chloride anion and the oxygen atom of urea also show a similar spatial distribution close to the cationic core of choline due to a similar charge located on both atoms. As a result of multiple similar interactions, clusters migrating together cannot be observed in reline which supports the hypothesis similia similibus solvuntur. In contrast to previous suggestions, the interaction of the hydroxyl group of choline with a hydrogen bond acceptor is overall rigid. Fast hydrogen bond acceptor dynamics is facilitated by the hydrogen atoms in the trans position to the carbonyl group of urea which contributes to the low melting point of reline.},

abstract = {Key points: Two functional abnormalities of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), a 25{\%} reduction of the single-channel conductance (g) and a ∼13-fold lower open probability (Po), were found with the R117H mutation that is associated with mild forms of cystic fibrosis. Characterizations of the gating defects of R117H-CFTR led to the conclusion that the mutation decreases Po by perturbing the gating conformational changes in CFTR's transmembrane domains (TMDs) without altering the function of the nucleotide binding domains (NBDs). Nonetheless, gating of the R117H-CFTR can be improved by a variety of pharmacological reagents supposedly acting on NBDs such as ATP analogues, or TMDs (e.g. VX-770 or nitrate). These reagents potentiate synergistically R117H-CFTR gating to a level that allows accurate assessments of its gating deficits. Our studies not only elucidate the mechanism underpinning gating dysfunction of R117H-CFTR, but also provide a mechanistic understanding of how VX-770 ameliorates the gating defects in the R117H mutant. Abstract: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is caused by loss-of-function mutations of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene encoding a phosphorylation-activated, but ATP-gated chloride channel. In the current study, we investigated the mechanism responsible for the gating defects manifested in R117H-CFTR, an arginine-to-histidine substitution at position 117 of CFTR that is associated with mild forms of CF. We confirmed previous findings of a 25{\%} decrease of the single-channel conductance (g) in R117H-CFTR, but found a ∼13-fold lower open probability (Po). This dramatic gating deficit is not due to dysfunctional nucleotide binding domains (NBDs) as the mutation does not alter the apparent affinity for ATP, and the mutant channels respond to ATP analogues in a similar manner as wild-type CFTR. Furthermore, once ATP hydrolysis is abolished, the R117H mutant can be trapped in a prolonged ‘burst opening' conformation that is proposed to be equipped with a stable NBD dimer. On the other hand, our results support the conclusion that the R117H mutation decreases Po by perturbing the gating conformational changes in CFTR's transmembrane domains as even when NBDs are kept at a dimerized configuration, Po is reduced by ∼10-fold. Moreover, our data demonstrate that a synergistic improvement of R117H-CFTR function can be accomplished with a combined regiment of VX-770 (Ivacaftor), nitrate ion (NO3−) and N6-(2-phenylethyl)-2′-deoxy-ATP (d-PATP), which almost completely rectifies the gating defect of R117H-CFTR. Clinical implications of our results are discussed.},

However, the importance of SOD1-Derlin-1 interaction in in vitro human model and in vivo mouse model remains to be elucidated. Here, we identify small-molecular-weight compounds that inhibit the SOD1-Derlin-1 interaction by screening approximately 160,000 compounds. The inhibitor prevents 122 types of SOD1mut from interacting with Derlin-1, and significantly ameliorates the ALS pathology both in motoneurons derived from patient induced pluripotent stem cells and in model mice. Our data suggest that the SOD1-Derlin-1 interaction contributes to the pathogenesis of ALS and is a promising drug target for ALS treatment.},

abstract = {The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) plays a critical role in transcellular ion transport and when defective, results in the genetic disease cystic fibrosis. CFTR is novel in the ATP-binding cassette superfamily as an ion channel that is enabled by a unique unstructured regulatory domain. This R domain contains multiple protein kinase A sites, which when phosphorylated allow channel gating. Most of the sites have been indicated to stimulate channel activity, while two of them have been suggested to be inhibitory. It is unknown whether individual sites act coordinately or distinctly. To address this issue, we raised monoclonal antibodies recognizing the unphosphorylated, but not the phosphorylated states of four functionally relevant sites (700, 737, 768, and 813). This enabled simultaneous monitoring of their phosphorylation and dephosphorylation and revealed that both processes occurred rapidly at the first three sites, but more slowly at the fourth. The parallel phosphorylation rates of the stimulatory 700 and the putative inhibitory 737 and 768 sites prompted us to reexamine the role of the latter two. With serines 737 and 768 reintroduced individually into a PKA insensitive variant, in which serines at 15 sites had been replaced by alanines, a level of channel activation by PKA was restored, showing that these sites can mediate stimulation. Thus, we have provided new tools to study the CFTR regulation by phosphorylation and found that sites proposed to inhibit channel activity can also participate in stimulation. {\textcopyright} 2009.},

Results of coarse-grained Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations of non-grafted vWF multimers subject to a shearing flow were used as input variables to a Random Forest Algorithm (RFA). Twenty unique features characterizing macromolecular conformation information of vWF multimers were used for training the RFA. The corresponding responses classify instantaneous A2 domain state as either folded or unfolded, and were directly taken from coarse-grained MD simulations. Three separate RFAs were trained using feature/response data of varying resolution, which provided deep insights into the highly correlated macromolecular dynamics occurring in concert with A2 domain unfolding events. The algorithm is used to analyze results of simulation, but has been developed for use with experimental data as well.},

In the GROMACS simulation software, it has for a long time been possible to use so-called virtual sites to increase the length of the timestep, resulting in a large gain of simulation efficiency. Up until now, support for this approach has in practice been limited to the standard 20 amino acids however, shrinking the applicability domain of virtual sites. MkVsites is a set of python tools which provides a convenient way to obtain all parameters necessary to use virtual sites for virtually any molecules in a simulation. Required as input to MkVsites is the molecular topology of the molecule(s) in question, along with a specification of where to find the parent force field. As such, MkVsites can be a very valuable tool suite for anyone who is routinely using GROMACS for the simulation of molecular systems.},

@article{Negoda2019b,
abstract = {Our molecular understanding of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR)—the chloride channel that is mutated in cystic fibrosis—has been greatly enhanced by a number of recent atomic-level structures of the protein in different conformations. One surprising aspect of these structures was the finding that the eighth of CFTR's 12 membrane-spanning segments (TM8) appeared close to the channel pore. Although functional evidence supports a role for other TMs in forming the pore, such a role for TM8 has not previously been reported. Here, we use patch-clamp recording to investigate the functional role of TM8. Using substituted cysteine accessibility mutagenesis, we find that three amino acid side-chains in TM8 (Y913, Y914, and Y917) are exposed to the extracellular, but not the intracellular, solution. Cysteine cross-linking experiments suggest that Y914 and Y917 are in close proximity to L102 (TM1) and F337 (TM6), respectively, suggesting that TM8 contributes to the narrow selectivity filter region of the pore. Different amino acid substitutions suggest that Y914, and to a lesser extent Y917, play important roles in controlling anion flux through the open channel. Furthermore, substitutions that reduce side-chain volume at Y917 severely affect channel gating, resulting in a channel with an extremely unstable open state. Our results suggest that pore-lining TM8 is among the most important TMs controlling the permeation phenotype of the CFTR channel, and also that movement of TM8 may be critically involved in channel gating.},

abstract = {The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is an unusual ABC transporter, functioning as a chloride channel critical for fluid homeostasis in multiple organs. Disruption of CFTR function is associated with cystic fibrosis making it an attractive therapeutic target. In addition, CFTR blockers are being developed as potential antidiarrheals. CFTR drug discovery is hampered by the lack of high resolution structural data, and considerable efforts have been invested in modeling the channel structure. Although previously published CFTR models that have been made publicly available mostly agree with experimental data relating to the overall structure, they present the channel in an outward-facing conformation that does not agree with expected properties of a "channel-like" structure. Here, we make available a model of CFTR in such a "channel-like" conformation, derived by a unique modeling approach combining restrained homology modeling and ROSETTA refinement. In contrast to others, the present model is in agreement with expected channel properties such as pore shape, dimensions, solvent accessibility, and experimentally derived distances. We have used the model to explore the interaction of open channel blockers within the pore, revealing a common binding mode and ionic interaction with K95, in agreement with experimental data. The binding-site was further validated using a virtual screening enrichment experiment, suggesting the model might be suitable for drug discovery. In addition, we subjected the model to a molecular dynamics simulation, revealing previously unaddressed salt-bridge interactions that may be important for structure stability and pore-lining residues that may take part in Cl - conductance. {\textcopyright} 2012 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {Soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptors (SNAREs) mediate membrane fusion reactions in eukaryotic cells by assembling into complexes that link vesicle-associated SNAREs with SNAREs on target membranes (t-SNAREs). Many SNARE complexes contain two t-SNAREs that form a heterodimer, a putative intermediate in SNARE assembly. Individual t-SNAREs (e.g., syntaxin 1A) also regulate synaptic calcium channels and cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), the epithelial chloride channel that is defective in cystic fibrosis. Whether the regulation of ion channels by individual t-SNAREs is related to SNARE complex assembly and membrane fusion is unknown. Here we show that CFTR channels are coordinately regulated by two cognate t-SNAREs, SNAP-23 (synaptosome-associated protein of 23 kDa) and syntaxin 1A. SNAP-23 physically associates with CFTR by binding to its amino-terminal tail, a region that modulates channel gating. CFTR-mediated chloride currents are inhibited by introducing excess SNAP-23 into HT29-Cl.19A epithelial cells. Conversely, CFTR activity is stimulated by a SNAP-23 antibody that blocks the binding of this t-SNARE to the CFTR amino-terminal tail. The physical and functional interactions between SNAP-23 and CFTR depend on syntaxin 1A, which binds to both proteins. We conclude that CFTR channels are regulated by a t-SNARE complex that may tune CFTR activity to rates of membrane traffic in epithelial cells.},

The method uniquely defines the length of simulation time required to achieve thermal equilibrium over a broad range of parameters, thus removing ambiguities associated with the traditional heuristic approaches. The proposed protocol saves simulation time and avoids bias introduced by the inclusion of non-equilibrium events. The key element of the procedure involves coupling only the solvent atoms to a standard heat bath. Measuring progress towards thermal equilibration involves simply monitoring the difference in temperature between the solvent and the protein. Here, we report that the results of MD simulations using the above procedure are measurably improved relative to the traditional approaches in terms of root-mean-square deviations and principal components analysis both indicating significantly less undesirable divergence.},

abstract = {The concept of absolute half-cell emf is discussed and defined as V MS-$\phi$M for the reaction M→M+ (solution)+e -(M), where VMS is the electrostatic potential difference between metal electrode and solution and $\phi$M the work function of metal in contact with solution. It is shown that this quantity is equal to VRS-$\phi$R, where VRS is the electrostatic potential difference between a reference electrode in air above the solution and the solution, and $\phi$R the work function in air of this reference. The quantity VRS′, the potential difference between reference electrode and the solution surface, was found experimentally by the vibrating condenser method for a number of half-cells, and $\phi$R was determined photoelectrically. It is shown from the variation of VRS′ with electrolyte concentration that the potential difference betwen the bulk of pure H2O and its air interface is ∼0.05 V, the surface being negative relative to bulk, and that this potential is increasingly screened out as electrolyte concentration increases. From these results for several different half- cells the absolute value of the standard half-cell emf for H2→2H+ is found to be -4.73±0.05 V. This result permits the calculation of single ion free energies of solvation. It is shown that the simple Born model as used by Latimer, Pitzer, and Slansky works remarkably well for simple cations, including polyvalent ones, and for spherical anions, but breaks down for complex anions like OH-, NO3-, etc. Ions in which chemical bonding effects to the solvent play an important role show anomalously high solvation energies. The solvation energy of H+ is -10.98 eV in H 2O and varies very little from this value in several different solvents, suggesting that free H+ may predominate in these solvents. This could result from the fact that the small effective radius of free H + leads to a greater solvation energy than the combination of bond formation and solvation of the resultant much larger ion (H solvent) +. Similar arguments can be used to explain why for instance Fe 3+ is not reduced by H2O despite the fact that the third ionization potential of Fe is 30 and that of water 12.6 eV. Other possible applications of the method used in these experiments are discussed. Copyright {\textcopyright} 1977 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = {Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disorder that causes multiorgan morbidity and premature death, most commonly from pulmonary dysfunction. Mutations in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene, of which almost 2000 have been described, result in a dysfunctional CFTR protein. This protein is an adenosine triphosphate binding anion channel, present primarily at the surface of epithelial cells. Loss of function mutations in this anion channel result in decreased or absent chloride/bicarbonate transport. The subsequent abnormal salt and water transport at epithelial cell surfaces leads to thickened secretions, and infection or inflammation in affected organs. In the last 20 years, therapeutics have been developed to treat the signs and symptoms of CF. However, in 2012, the small molecule drug, ivacaftor, became the first approved therapy that addresses the basic defect in CF. Ivacaftor is a potentiator of CFTR channels defective in their chloride/bicarbonate gating/conductance, but present at the epithelial cell surface. It is only approved for 10 mutations carried by approximately 7{\%} of the population of patients with CF. F508del is the most common CFTR mutation, present in homozygosity in approximately 50{\%} of patients with CF. The F508del mutation results in multiple CFTR channel defects that require both correction (stabilization of misfolded CFTR and trafficking to the epithelial cell membrane) and potentiation. This article reviews the in vitro and clinical trial data for the potential use of the potentiator, ivacaftor, and the corrector, lumacaftor, in patients with CF. {\textcopyright} 2015, SAGE Publications.

abstract = {Based on the crystal structure of the cross-$\beta$ spine formed by the peptide NNQQNY, we have developed a computational approach for identifying those segments of amyloidogenic proteins that themselves can form amyloid-like fibrils. The approach builds on experiments showing that hexapeptides are sufficient for forming amyloid-like fibrils. Each six-residue peptide of a protein of interest is mapped onto an ensemble of templates, or 3D profile, generated from the crystal structure of the peptide NNQQNY by small displacements of one of the two intermeshed $\beta$-sheets relative to the other. The energy of each mapping of a sequence to the profile is evaluated by using ROSETTADESIGN, and the lowest energy match for a given peptide to the template library is taken as the putative prediction. If the energy of the putative prediction is lower than a threshold value, a prediction of fibril formation is made. This method can reach an accuracy of ≈80{\%} with a P value of ≈10 -12 when a conservative energy threshold is used to separate peptides that form fibrils from those that do not. We see enrichment for positive predictions in a set of fibril-forming segments of amyloid proteins, and we illustrate the method with applications to proteins of interest in amyloid research. {\textcopyright} 2006 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.},

abstract = {A total of 94 deep eutectic solvents (DESs) based on different combinations of salt cation, anion, hydrogen-bond donor (HBD) and salt:HBD molar ratio are screened via the conductor-like screening model for real solvents for potential use in the extractive denitrification of diesel. Five nonbasic and six basic nitrogen compounds were included in this study. The activity coefficient at infinite dilution, $\gamma$∞, of each nitrogen compound in the DESs was predicted; and the values are used to screen the DESs on the basis of selectivity, capacity, and performance index at infinite dilution (S∞, C∞, and PI). The extraction of nitrogen compounds using DES is driven by hydrogen-bonding interaction. It was found that nonbasic compounds report higher S∞ and C∞ than basic compounds. Ammonium-based DESs give higher S∞ but phosphonium-based DESs report higher C∞. DESs combined with Cl-anion give higher S∞, but those with Br-anion report higher C∞. DESs with alcohol- and amide-based HBDs give higher S∞ but HBDs with carboxylic acid group report high C∞. Molar ratio has little effect toward S∞ and C∞. DESs with high values of S∞ generally have high PI.},

Partial purification has been achieved through use of carboxymethyl-Sephadex chromatography. The resulting activator fraction contained no hemoglobin and only 0.3{\%} of the total adenylate kinase activity of the cell. 2. Whereas the activator was released from erythrocytes subjected to hemolysis in 20 miosM buffer at pH 7.6 or at pH 5.8, only the membranes prepared at pH 7.6 were affected by it. 2. Whereas the activator was released from erythrocytes subjected to hemolysis in 20 miosM buffer at pH 7.6 or at pH 5.8, only the membranes prepared at pH 7.6 were affected by it. 3. When (Ca2+ plus Mg2+)-ATPase activity was measured by 32Pi release from (gamma-32P)ATP, freeze-thawed erythrocytes, as well as membranes prepared at pH 5.8 and at pH 7.6, expressed lower values than noted by assay for total Pi release. When ADP instead of ATP was used as substrate, significant amount of Pi were released by these erythrocyte preparations. Further study revealed (a) production of ATP and AMP from ADP with membranes and hemolysate alone, and (b) exchange of the gamma-and B-position phosphate on (gama-32P)ATP in the presence of membranes plus hemolysates. These observations established the presence of adenylate kinase activity in the (membrane-free) hemolysates and in membranes. It further supports the conclusion that Pi release from ADP by human erythrocytes (freeze-thawed) and by their isolated membranes is due to formation of ATP by adenylate kinase and hydrolysis of this generated ATP by (Ca2+ plus Mg2+)-ATPase. 4. The following points were also established: (a) absence of an ADPase in human erythrocytes; (b) the (Ca2+ plus Mg2+)-ATPase activator enhanced cleavage only of the gama-position of ATP and (c) the (Ca2+ plus Mg2+)-ATPase activator is neither adenylate kinase nor hemoglobin.},

abstract = {The stability of the crystal structure of the multidrug transporter P-glycoprotein proposed by Aller et al. (PDBid 3G5U) has been examined under different environmental conditions using molecular dynamics. We show that in the presence of the detergent cholate, the structure of P-glycoprotein solved at pH 7.5 is stable. However, when incorporated into a cholesterol-enriched POPC membrane in the presence of 150 mM NaCl, the structure rapidly deforms. Only when the simulation conditions closely matched the experimental conditions under which P-glycoprotein is transport active was a stable conformation obtained. Specifically, the presence of Mg 2+, which bound to distinct sites in the nucleotide binding domains (NBDs), and the double protonation of the catalytic histidines (His583 and His1228) and His149 were required. While the structure obtained in a membrane environment under these conditions is very similar to the crystal structure of Aller et al., there are several key differences. The NBDs are in direct contact, reminiscent of the open state of MalK. The angle between the transmembrane domains is also increased, resulting in an outward motion of the intracellular loops. Notably, the structures obtained from the simulations provide a better match to a range of experimental cross-linking data than does the original 3G5U-a crystal structure. This work highlights the effect small changes in environmental conditions can have of the conformation of a membrane protein and the importance of representing the experimental conditions appropriately in modeling studies. {\textcopyright} 2012 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {Advances in simulation techniques and computing hardware have created a substantial overlap between the timescales accessible to atomic-level simulations and those on which the fastest-folding proteins fold. Here we demonstrate, using simulations of four variants of the human villin headpiece, how simulations of spontaneous folding and unfolding can provide direct access to thermodynamic and kinetic quantities such as folding rates, free energies, folding enthalpies, heat capacities, ℙ-values, and temperaturejump relaxation profiles. The quantitative comparison of simulation results with various forms of experimental data probing different aspects of the folding process can facilitate robust assessment of the accuracy of the calculations while providing a detailed structural interpretation for the experimental observations. In the example studied here, the analysis of folding rates, ℙ-values, and folding pathways provides support for the notion that a norleucine double mutant of villin folds five times faster than the wild-type sequence, but following a slightly different pathway. This work showcases how computer simulation has now developed into a mature tool for the quantitative computational study of protein folding and dynamics that can provide a valuable complement to experimental techniques.},

Though the DFT method yields excellent gas-phase energetics for the reaction, the QM/MM approach is found to yield overestimation of the activation barrier by ca. 12 kcal/mol. The discrepancy is traced to underestimate of the magnitude of the partial charges on the chlorine atoms in the transition structure. When CM1 or CM3 charges based on semiempirical wave functions are used instead, the agreement with experiment is much improved. The findings emphasize the sensitivity of the results of QM/MM calculations to the choice of QM method, the MM force field, and implementation of the QM/MM interface.},

In addition, nucleotide binding and hydrolysis at the nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs) of CFTR are required for channel gating. We report NMR studies in the absence and presence of NBD1 that provide structural details for the isolated R region and its interaction with NBD1 at residue-level resolution. Several sites in the R region with measured fractional helical propensity mediate interactions with NBD1. Phosphorylation reduces the helicity of many R-region sites and reduces their NBD1 interactions. This evidence for a dynamic complex with NBD1 that transiently engages different sites of the R region suggests a structural explanation for the dependence of CFTR activity on multiple PKA phosphorylation sites. {\textcopyright} 2007 Nature Publishing Group.},

The activity of mTORC1 is controlled by Rag GTPases, which are anchored to lysosomes via Ragulator, a pentameric protein complex consisting of membrane-anchored p18/LAMTOR1 and two roadblock heterodimers. Here we report the crystal structure of Ragulator in complex with the roadblock domains of RagA-C, which helps to elucidate the molecular basis for the regulation of Rag GTPases. In the structure, p18 wraps around the three pairs of roadblock heterodimers to tandemly assemble them onto lysosomes. Cellular and in vitro analyses further demonstrate that p18 is required for Ragulator-Rag GTPase assembly and amino acid-dependent activation of mTORC1. These results establish p18 as a critical organizing scaffold for the Ragulator-Rag GTPase complex, which may provide a platform for nutrient sensing on lysosomes.},

abstract = {Molecular dynamics simulations are being applied to increasingly complex systems, including those involving small endogenous compounds and drug molecules. In order to obtain meaningful and accurate data from these simulations, high-quality topologies for small molecules must be generated in a manner that is consistent with the derivation of the force field applied to the system. Often, force fields are designed for use with macromolecules such as proteins, making their transferability to other species challenging. Investigators are increasingly attracted to automated topology generation programs, although the quality of the resulting topologies remains unknown. Here we assess the applicability of the popular PRODRG server that generates small-molecule topologies for use with the GROMOS family of force fields. We find that PRODRG does not reproduce topologies for even the most well-characterized species in the force field due to inconsistent charges and charge groups. We assessed the effects of PRODRG-derived charges on several systems: pure liquids, amino acids at a hydrophobic-hydrophilic interface, and an enzyme-cofactor complex. We found that partial atomic charges generated by PRODRG are largely incompatible with GROMOS force fields, and the behavior of these systems deviates substantially from that of simulations using GROMOS parameters. We conclude by proposing several points as "best practices" for parametrization of small molecules under the GROMOS force fields. {\textcopyright} 2010 American Chemical Society.},

This leads to instability of the nascent protein and the modified structure is recognised and then degraded by the ER quality control mechanism. However, even pharmacologically ‘rescued' F508del CFTR displays instability at the cell's surface, losing its channel function rapidly and it is rapidly removed from the plasma membrane for lysosomal degradation. This review will, therefore, explore the link between stability and structure/function relationships of membrane proteins and CFTR in particular and how approaches to study CFTR structure depend on its stability. We will also review the application of a fluorescence labelling method for the assessment of the thermostability and the tertiary structure of CFTR.},

The present work attempts to resolve this difficulty using molecular dynamics simulations with the AMOEBA polarizable force field and perturbation techniques to directly compute absolute solvation free energies for potassium, sodium, and chloride ions in liquid water and formamide. Corresponding calculations are also performed with two widely used nonpolarizable force fields. The simulations with the polarizable force field accurately reproduce in vacuo quantum mechanical results, experimental ion-cluster solvation enthalpies, and experimental solvation free energies for whole salts, while the other force fields do not. The results indicate that calculations with a polarizable force field can capture the thermodynamics of ion solvation and that the solvation free energies of the individual ions differ by several kilocalories from commonly cited values.},

In particular, our MD results predict that the salt with a larger anion (NaCl) shows a smaller increase in surface tension than the salt with a smaller anion (NaF). To check the limits of applicability of the solvent primitive model (SPM), we solve exactly the system with the approximation that the solvent (water) is a background dielectric continuum using MD simulations. Compared with explicit water MD simulations, SPM gives qualitatively incorrect results for the dependence of surface tension on the type of salt. More precisely, with the solvent as a dielectric continuum, an NaCl solution shows a larger increase in surface tension than does an NaF solution. Strong water structuring around the solvated ions is the proposed explanation.},

abstract = {Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is the most common life-shortening genetic disease among Caucasians, resulting from mutations in the gene encoding the Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane conductance Regulator (CFTR). While work to understand this protein has resulted in new treatment strategies, it is important to emphasize that CFTR exists within a complex lipid bilayer — a concept largely overlooked when performing structural and functional studies. In this review we discuss cellular lipid imbalances in CF, mechanisms by which lipids affect membrane protein activity, and the specific impact of detergents and lipids on CFTR function. In this review, Cottrill et al. discuss how the Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane conductance Regulator (CFTR) interacts with the membrane into which it is inserted. They summarize recent insight into the ways lipids are imbalanced in CF epithelia and how the lipid environment affects CFTR.},

abstract = {Rapid progress in DNA synthesis and sequencing is spearheading the deliberate, large-scale genetic alteration of organisms. These new advances in DNA manipulation have been extended to the level of whole-genome synthesis, as evident from the synthesis of poliovirus, from the resurrection of the extinct 1918 strain of influenza virus and of human endogenous retroviruses and from the restructuring of the phage T7 genome. The largest DNA synthesized so far is the 582,970 base pair genome of Mycoplasma genitalium, although, as yet, this synthetic DNA has not been 'booted' to life. As genome synthesis is independent of a natural template, it allows modification of the structure and function of a virus's genetic information to an extent that was hitherto impossible. The common goal of this new strategy is to further our understanding of an organism's properties, particularly its pathogenic armory if it causes disease in humans, and to make use of this new information to protect from, or treat, human viral disease. Although only a few applications of virus synthesis have been described as yet, key recent findings have been the resurrection of the 1918 influenza virus and the generation of codon-and codon pair-deoptimized polioviruses. {\textcopyright} 2009 Nature America, Inc.

abstract = {Correlated motions in biomolecules are often essential for their function, for example, allosteric signal transduction or mechanical/thermodynamic energy transport. Principal component analysis (PCA) is a widely used method to extract functionally relevant collective motions from a molecular dynamics (MD) trajectory. Being based on the covariance matrix, however, PCA detects only linear correlations. Here we present a new method, full correlation analysis (FCA), which is based on mutual information and thus quantifies all correlations, including nonlinear and higher order correlations. For comparison, we applied both, PCA and FCA, to ∼100 ns MD trajectories of T4 lysozyme and the hexapeptide neurotensin. For both systems, FCA yielded better resolved conformational substates and aligned its modes more often with actual transition pathways. This improved resolution is shown to be due to a strongly increased anharmonicity of FCA modes as compared to the respective PCA modes. The high anharmonicity further suggests that the motions extracted by FCA are functionally more relevant than those captured by PCA. In summary, FCA should provide improved collective degrees of freedom for dimension-reduced descriptions of macromolecular dynamics. {\textcopyright} 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

abstract = {Potassium (K+) channels are specialized membrane proteins that are able to facilitate and regulate the conduction of K+ through cell membranes. Comprising five specific cation binding sites (S0-S4) formed by the backbone carbonyl groups of conserved residues common to all K+ channels, the narrow selectivity filter allows fast conduction of K+ while being highly selective for K+ over Na+. To extend our knowledge of the microscopic mechanism underlying selectivity in K+ channels, we characterize the free energy landscapes governing the entry and translocation of a Na+ or a K+ from the extracellular side into the selectivity filter of KcsA. The entry process of an extracellular ion is examined in the presence of two additional K+ in the pore, and the three-ion potential of mean force is computed using extensive all-atom umbrella sampling molecular dynamics simulations. A comparison of the potentials of mean force yields a number of important results. First, the free energy minima corresponding to configurations with extracellular K+ or Na+ in binding site S0 or S1 are similar in depth, suggesting that the thermodynamic selectivity governed by the free energy minima for those two binding sites is insignificant. Second, the free energy barriers between stable multi-ion configurations are generally higher for Na+ than for K+, implying that the kinetics of ion conduction is slower when a Na+ enters the pore. Third, the region corresponding to binding site S2 near the center of the narrow pore emerges as the most selective for K+ over Na+. In particular, while there is a stable minimum for K+ in site S2, Na+ faces a steep free energy increase with no local free energy well in this region. Lastly, analysis shows that selectivity is not correlated with the overall coordination number of the ion entering the pore, but is predominantly affected by changes in the type of coordinating ligands (carbonyls versus water molecules). These results further highlight the importance of the central region near binding site S2 in the selectivity filter of K+ channels. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

None of the type IIIc, AX or ACCR(B) strains of rabbits gave either restricted responses when immunized with the pneumococcal vaccines. Three of the ACEP strain rabbits and two of the type III strain produced large quantities of highly restricted antibodies and were used to initiate structural studies on the antigen-combining site of antibody molecules. The rabbit antibodies were purified initially by affinity chromatography. The anti-SVIII antibodies were all eluted in a single fraction from an SVIII immunoadsorbent. The anti-SIII antibodies were all eluted in two fractions (one in various aqueous buffers and the other in guanidine-HCl) from an SIII immunoadsorbent. The specificially purified antibodies were examined analytically by isoelectric focusing in polyacrylamide gels and then were further fractionated by preparative liquid isoelectric focusing. Each purified antibody preparation from a restricted responder yielded 2-4 major electrofocused antibody fractions. The isoelectric point difference between the first and last eluted focused antibody fractions varied between 0{\textperiodcentered}2-0{\textperiodcentered}8 pH unit. The affinity chromatography and the isoelectric focusing procedures provide a successful means of preparatively obtaining different antibody fractions even from a single highly restricted antiserum. {\textcopyright} 1975.},

Proper shuttling between the nucleus and cytoplasm is essential for physiological cell function. However, the initial event in the pathophysiology of FUS-ALS remains enigmatic. Using human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSCs)-derived motor neurons (MNs), we show that impairment of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP)-dependent DNA damage response (DDR) signaling due to mutations in the FUS nuclear localization sequence (NLS) induces additional cytoplasmic FUS mislocalization which in turn results in neurodegeneration and FUS aggregate formation. Our work suggests that a key pathophysiologic event in ALS is upstream of aggregate formation. Targeting DDR signaling could lead to novel therapeutic routes for ameliorating ALS.},

abstract = {Native mass spectrometry (MS) is a powerful means for studying macromolecular protein assemblies, including accessing activated states. However, much remains to be understood about what governs which regions of the protein (un)folding funnel, which can be explored by activation of protein ions in a vacuum. Here, we examine the trajectory that Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1) dimers take over the unfolding and dissociation free energy landscape in a vacuum. We examined wild-type SOD1 and six disease-related point mutants by using tandem MS and ion-mobility MS as a function of collisional activation. For six of the seven SOD1 variants, increasing activation prompted dimers to transition through two unfolding events and dissociate symmetrically into monomers with (as near as possible) equal charges. The exception was G37R, which proceeded only through the first unfolding transition and displayed a much higher abundance of asymmetric products. Supported by the observation that ejected asymmetric G37R monomers were more compact than symmetric G37R ones, we localized this effect to the formation of a gas-phase salt bridge in the first activated conformation. To examine the data quantitatively, we applied Arrhenius-type analysis to estimate the barriers on the corresponding free energy landscape. This reveals a heightening of the barrier to unfolding in G37R by {\textgreater}5 kJ/mol-1 over the other variants, consistent with expectations for the strength of a salt bridge. Our work demonstrates weaknesses in the simple general framework for understanding protein complex dissociation in a vacuum and highlights the importance of individual residues, their local environment, and specific interactions in governing product formation.},

We progress through eight membranes of increasing chemical complexity, ranging from a simple POPC/CHOL membrane to a previously published neuronal plasma membrane [Ing{\'{o}}lfsson, H. I., et al.

abstract = {The infrared (IR) spectra of polypeptides are dominated by the so-called amide bands. Because they originate from the strongly polar and polarizable amide groups (AGs) making up the backbone, their spectral positions sensitively depend on the local electric fields. Aiming at accurate computations of these IR spectra by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, which derive atomic forces from a hybrid quantum and molecular mechanics (QM/MM) Hamiltonian, here we consider the effects of solvation in bulk liquid water on the amide bands of the AG model compound N-methyl-acetamide (NMA). As QM approach to NMA we choose grid-based density functional theory (DFT). For the surrounding MM water, we develop, largely based on computations, a polarizable molecular mechanics (PMM) model potential called GP6P, which features six Gaussian electrostatic sources (one induced dipole, five static partial charge distributions) and, therefore, avoids spurious distortions of the DFT electron density in hybrid DFT/PMM simulations. Bulk liquid GP6P is shown to have favorable properties at the thermodynamic conditions of the parameterization and beyond. Lennard-Jones (LJ) parameters of the DFT fragment NMA are optimized by comparing radial distribution functions in the surrounding GP6P liquid with reference data obtained from a "first-principles" DFT-MD simulation. Finally, IR spectra of NMA in GP6P water are calculated from extended DFT/PMM-MD trajectories, in which the NMA is treated by three different DFT functionals (BP, BLYP, B3LYP). Method-specific frequency scaling factors are derived from DFT-MD simulations of isolated NMA. The DFT/PMM-MD simulations with GP6P and with the optimized LJ parameters then excellently predict the effects of aqueous solvation and deuteration observed in the IR spectra of NMA. As a result, the methods required to accurately compute such spectra by DFT/PMM-MD also for larger peptides in aqueous solution are now at hand.},

abstract = {The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is an ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter that uniquely functions as an ion channel. Here, we present a 3.9 {\AA} structure of dephosphorylated human CFTR without nucleotides, determined by electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM). Close resemblance of this human CFTR structure to zebrafish CFTR under identical conditions reinforces its relevance for understanding CFTR function. The human CFTR structure reveals a previously unresolved helix belonging to the R domain docked inside the intracellular vestibule, precluding channel opening. By analyzing the sigmoid time course of CFTR current activation, we propose that PKA phosphorylation of the R domain is enabled by its infrequent spontaneous disengagement, which also explains residual ATPase and gating activity of dephosphorylated CFTR. From comparison with MRP1, a feature distinguishing CFTR from all other ABC transporters is the helix-loop transition in transmembrane helix 8, which likely forms the structural basis for CFTR's channel function.},

abstract = {The past two decades have witnessed major breakthroughs in developing compounds that target the chloride channel CFTR for the treatment of patients with cystic fibrosis. However, further improvement in affinity and efficacy for these CFTR modulators will require insights into the molecular interactions between CFTR modulators and their binding targets. In this study, we use in silico molecular docking to identify potential binding sites for GLPG1837, a CFTR potentiator that may share a common mechanism and binding site with VX-770, the FDA-approved drug for patients carrying mutations with gating defects. Among the five binding sites predicted by docking, the two top-scoring sites are located at the interface between CFTR's two transmembrane domains: Site I consists of D924, N1138, and S1141, and site IIN includes F229, F236, Y304, F312, and F931. Using mutagenesis to probe the importance of these sites for GLPG187 binding, we find that disruption of predicted hydrogenbonding interactions by mutation of D924 decreases apparent affinity, while hydrophobic amino acids substitutions at N1138 and introduction of positively charged amino acids at S1141 improve the apparent affinity for GLPG1837. Alanine substitutions at Y304, F312, and F931 (site IIN) decrease the affinity for GLPG1837, whereas alanine substitutions at F229 and F236 (also site IIN), or at residues in the other three lower-scoring sites, have little effect. In addition, current relaxation analysis to assess the apparent dissociation rate of VX-770 yields results consistent with the dose-response experiments for GLPG8137, with the dissociation rate of VX-770 accelerated by D924N, F236A, Y304A, and F312A, but decelerated by N1138L and S1141K mutations. Collectively, these data identify two potential binding sites for GLPG1837 and VX-770 in CFTR. We discuss the pros and cons of evidence for these two loci and the implications for future drug design.},

abstract = {The majority of cystic fibrosis (CF)-causing mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) lead to the misfolding, mistrafficking, and degradation of the mutant protein. Inhibition of degradation does not effectively increase the amount of trafficking competent CFTR, but typically leads to increased ER retention of misfolded forms. Thus, the initial off pathway steps occur early in the processing of the protein. To identify proteins that interact with these early forms of CFTR, in vitro crosslink experiments identified cotranslational partners of the nascent chain of the severe misfolded mutant, G85E CFTR. The mutant preferentially interacts with a subunit of an N-alpha-acetyltransferase A. Based on recent reports that acetylation of the N-termini of some N-end rule substrates control their ubiquitination and subsequent degradation, a potential role for this modification in regulation of CFTR expression was assessed. Knockdown experiments identified two complexes, which affect G85E CFTR proteins levels, NatA and NatB. Effects of the knockdowns on mRNA levels, translation rates, and degradation rates established that the two complexes regulate G85E CFTR through two separate mechanisms. NatA acts indirectly by regulating transcription levels and NatB acts through a previously identified, but incompletely understood posttranslational mechanism. This regulation did not effect trafficking of G85E CFTR, which remains retained in the ER, nor did it alter the degradation rate of CFTR. A mutation predicted to inhibit N-terminal acetylation of CFTR, Q2P, was without effect, suggesting neither system acts directly on CFTR. These results contradict the prediction that N-terminal acetylation of CFTR determines its fitness as a proteasome substrate, but rather NatB plays a role in the conformational maturation of CFTR in the ER through actions on an unidentified protein.},

All these empirical water models used in this study are similar by having three interaction sites, but the small differences in their pair potentials composed of Lennard-Jones (LJ) and Coulombic terms give significant differences in the calculated self-diffusion coefficients, and in the height of the second peak of the radial distribution function gOO.},

abstract = {In this article, we have compared the anions of sodium salts (Is) and ionic liquids (ILs) with the stability and structure of $\alpha$-chymotrypsin (CT), through fluorescence, thermal fluorescence analysis and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy. The experimental results revealed that the Hofmeister series of anions such as SCN{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}, SO{\textless}inf{\textgreater}4{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}{\textless}sup{\textgreater}2-{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}, Cl{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}, Br{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}, CH{\textless}inf{\textgreater}3{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}COO{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} and I{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} of Is destabilized the native structure of CT. On the contrary, the anions such as CH{\textless}inf{\textgreater}3{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}COO{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}, Cl{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} and Br{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} of imidazolium-based IL with a fixed cation such as 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium, [Bmim]{\textless}sup{\textgreater}+{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}, stabilized the native structure of CT. The remaining anions of ILs such as SCN{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}, HSO{\textless}inf{\textgreater}4{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}, and I{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} acted as denaturing agents for the native structure of CT. Furthermore, molecular docking results show that the imidazolium-cation of the IL enters the sub-domains of CT and interacts with the ionic residues of CT, that is, Ser217 close to Trp215. This interaction is in well agreement with the fluorescence quenching observed for CT in the presence of [Bmim]{\textless}sup{\textgreater}+{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}. On the other hand, the destabilizing anion such as SO{\textless}inf{\textgreater}4{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}{\textless}sup{\textgreater}2-{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} was observed to be directly interacting with Ser195 in the active site of CT. We have observed that the Hofmeister series effects of anions of either Is or ILs are entirely based on the interaction of the anions with their counterions, that is, cations, with solvent molecules, as well as with the protein surface. Evidently, these interactions vary with the co-solvent system and the type of protein. Hence, the stability of a biomolecule in the presence of the anions may or may not obey the Hofmeister series.},

abstract = {Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a lethal, genetic disease found in particular in humans of European origin which is caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) chloride channel. The search for CF therapies acting by modulating the impaired function of mutant CFTR will be greatly advanced by high resolution structures of CFTR in different states. To date, two medium resolution electron microscopy (EM) structures of CFTR are available (one of a distant zebrafish (Danio rerio) CFTR ortholog and one of human CFTR). The two models are nearly identical to one another, and both correspond to the inward-facing, nucleotide binding domains (NBDs) separated, closed state of the channel. In addition, lower resolution structural data are available for human CFTR in an alternative conformation which likely features associated NBDs and thus geometrically resembles the conducting state of the channel. Multiple homology models of human CFTR in multiple states have been developed over the years, yet their correspondence to the existing structural information is unexplored. In this work we use molecular dynamics flexible fitting (MDFF) simulations to refine two previously described CFTR models based on the available cryo-EM map of the human protein. This map was recorded in the absence of ATP and consequently represents closed-state CFTR yet its features likely correspond to an NBD associated conformation of the protein. Accordingly, the resulting models feature dimerized NBDs yet with no membrane traversing pore. Moreover, the open probability of the new models as deduced from the MDFF trajectories is significantly lower than that deduced from control MD trajectories initiated from the starting models. We propose that the new models correspond to a CFTR conformation which to date was largely unexplored yet is one that is relevant to the gating cycle of the protein. In particular this conformation may participate in rapid channel opening and closing through small allosteric movements controlled by nucleotide binding and dissociation events. Analyzing the resulting trajectories (and not only the final models as is usually the case), we demonstrate that the refined models have good stereochemical properties and are also in favorable agreement with multiple experimental data. Moreover, despite different starting points, the final models share many common features. Finally, we propose that the combination of high resolution cryo-EM maps, which are currently emerging from multiple laboratories, and MDFF simulations will be of value for the development of yet more reliable CFTR models as well as for the identification of binding sites for CFTR modulators.},

Wemake use of molecular dynamics simulations of Protein L in water, in urea, and in guanidinium chloride (GdmCl) to ascertain if there are any structural differences in the associated unfolding processes. The simulation of proteins in solutions of GdmCl is complicated by the large number of charges involved, making it difficult to set up a realistic force field. Furthermore, at high concentrations of this denaturant, the motion of the solvent slows considerably. The simulations show that the unfolding mechanism depends on the denaturing agent: in urea the $\beta$-sheet is destabilized first, whereas in GdmCl, it is the $\alpha$-helix. Moreover, whereas urea interacts with the protein accumulating in the first solvation shell, GdmCl displays a longer-range electrostatic effect that does not perturb the structure of the solvent close to the protein. {\textcopyright} 2008 by the Biophysical Society.},

These substances likely target key conformational changes occurring during channel opening and closing, however, the molecular bases of these conformational changes, and their susceptibility to manipulation are poorly understood. We have used patch clamp recording to identify changes in the three-dimensional organization of the extracellularly accessible parts of the CFTR protein during channel opening and closing. State-dependent formation of both disulfide bonds and Cd2+ bridges occurred for pairs of cysteine side-chains introduced into the extreme extracellular ends of transmembrane helices (TMs) 1, 6, and 12. Between each of these three TMs, we found that both disulfide bonds and metal bridges formed preferentially or exclusively in the closed state and that these inter-TM cross-links stabilized the closed state. These results indicate that the extracellular ends of these TMs are close together when the channel is closed and that they separate from each other when the channel opens. These findings identify for the first time key conformational changes in the extracellular parts of the CFTR protein that can potentially be manipulated to control channel activity.},

Whereas recent NMR studies have demonstrated that different JD conformations exist, the likelihood of JD achievable conformational states in solution is still an open issue. Marked differences in the available NMR models are located in the hairpin region, supporting the idea that JD has a flexible hairpin in dynamic equilibrium between open and closed states. In this work we have carried out an investigation on the JD conformational arrangement by means of both classical molecular dynamics (MD) and Metadynamics employing essential coordinates as collective variables. We provide a representation of the free energy landscape characterizing the transition pathway from a JD open-like structure to a closed-like conformation. Findings of our in silico study strongly point to the closed-like conformation as the most likely for a Josephin Domain in water.},

Our methods is tested on a DPPC (no unsaturated chain), a POPC (one unsaturated chain), and a DOPC (two unsaturated chains) lipid bilayers. We calculate various physical properties of the membrane of our simulations with and without virtual sites and explain the differences and similarity observed. The best agreements are obtained for the GROMACS original virtual sites on the DOPC bilayer where we get an area per lipid of 67.3 ± 0.3 A˚2 without virtual sites and 67.6 ± 0.3 A˚2 with virtual sites. In conclusion the virtual-sites technique on lipid membranes is a powerful simulation tool, but it should be used with care. The procedure can be applied to other force fields and lipids in a straightforward manner. (Figure Presented).},

abstract = {An outstanding challenge in the field of molecular biology has been to understand the process by which proteins fold into their characteristic three-dimensional structures. Here, we report the results of atomic-level molecular dynamics simulations, over periods ranging between 100 $\mu$s and 1 ms, that reveal a set of common principles underlying the folding of 12 structurally diverse proteins. In simulations conducted with a single physics-based energy function, the proteins, representing all three major structural classes, spontaneously and repeatedly fold to their experimentally determined native structures. Early in the folding process, the protein backbone adopts a nativelike topology while certain secondary structure elements and a small number of nonlocal contacts form. In most cases, folding follows a single dominant route in which elements of the native structure appear in an order highly correlated with their propensity to form in the unfolded state.},

abstract = {A limitation of traditional molecular dynamics (MD) is that reaction rates are difficult to compute. This is due to the rarity of observing transitions between metastable states since high energy barriers trap the system in these states. Recently the weighted ensemble (WE) family of methods have emerged which can flexibly and efficiently sample conformational space without being trapped and allow calculation of unbiased rates. However, while WE can sample correctly and efficiently, a scalable implementation applicable to interesting biomolecular systems is not available. We provide here a GPLv2 implementation called AWE-WQ of a WE algorithm using the master/worker distributed computing WorkQueue (WQ) framework. AWE-WQ is scalable to thousands of nodes and supports dynamic allocation of computer resources, heterogeneous resource usage (such as central processing units (CPU) and graphical processing units (GPUs) concurrently), seamless heterogeneous cluster usage (i.e., campus grids and cloud providers), and support for arbitrary MD codes such as GROMACS, while ensuring that all statistics are unbiased. We applied AWE-WQ to a 34 residue protein which simulated 1.5 ms over 8 months with peak aggregate performance of 1000 ns/h. Comparison was done with a 200's simulation collected on a GPU over a similar timespan. The folding and unfolded rates were of comparable accuracy.},

Proteins are also dynamic in evolution: significant variations in secondary, tertiary and quaternary structure can be observed among divergent members of a protein family. Recent work has highlighted intriguing similarities between these structural and evolutionary dynamics occurring at various levels. Here we review evidence showing how evolutionary changes in protein sequence and structure are often closely related to local protein flexibility and disorder, large-scale motions and quaternary structure assembly. We suggest that these correspondences can be largely explained by neutral evolution, while deviations between structural and evolutionary dynamics can provide valuable functional insights. Finally, we address future prospects for the field and practical applications that arise from a deeper understanding of the intimate relationship between protein structure, dynamics, function and evolution. {\textcopyright} 2014 WILEY Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract = {Molecular-docking programs coupled with suitable scoring functions are now established and very useful tools enabling computational chemists to rapidly screen large chemical databases and thereby to identify promising candidate compounds for further experimental processing. In a broader scenario, predicting binding affinity is one of the most critical and challenging components of computer-aided structure-based drug design. The development of a molecular docking scoring function which in principle could combine both features, namely ranking putative poses and predicting complex affinity, would be of paramount importance. Here, we systematically investigated the performance of the MM-PBSA approach, using two different Poisson-Boltzmann solvers (APBS and DelPhi), in the currently rising field of protein-peptide interactions (PPIs), identifying the correct binding conformations of 19 different protein-peptide complexes and predicting their binding free energies. First, we scored the decoy structures from HADDOCK calculation via the MM-PBSA approach in order to assess the capability of retrieving near-native poses in the best-scoring clusters and of evaluating the corresponding free energies of binding. MM-PBSA behaves well in finding the poses corresponding to the lowest binding free energy, however the built-in HADDOCK score shows a better performance. In order to improve the MM-PBSA-based scoring function, we dampened the MM-PBSA solvation and coulombic terms by 0.2, as proposed in the HADDOCK score and LIE approaches. The new dampened MM-PBSA (dMM-PBSA) outperforms the original MM-PBSA and ranks the decoys structures as the HADDOCK score does. Second, we found a good correlation between the dMM-PBSA and HADDOCK scores for the near-native clusters of each system and the experimental binding energies, respectively. Therefore, we propose a new scoring function, dMM-PBSA, to be used together with the built-in HADDOCK score in the context of protein-peptide docking simulations.},

We have investigated the interplay of an Arginine–Aspartic acid salt bridge with simple salt ions in aqueous solution by means of molecular dynamics simulations. Besides structural and dynamical features at equilibrium, we have computed the mean force along the dissociation pathway of the salt bridge. We demonstrate that solvated ions influence the behavior of the salt bridge in a very specific and local way, namely the formation of tight ionic pairs Li+/Na+–Asp−. Moreover, our findings show that the enthalpic relevance of the salt bridge is minor, regardless of the presence of solvated ions.},

They have been the focus of interest in past years due to their unique properties, low cost, and wide range of applications. Despite the attention given to DES and their claimed benignity when compared with ionic liquids, their environmental impact is poorly characterized and understood. In this work, the toxicity of some DES prepared with cholinium chloride ([Chol]Cl) as HBA and organic acids, namely acetic, citric, lactic, and glycolic acids, as HBD was measured with the Microtox toxicity test. These DES showed an intermediate toxicity when compared with the respective starting materials and can be considered as "moderately toxic," their toxicity being clearly dominated by the concentration of the acid. They are also shown to be more toxic than their corresponding ionic liquids, namely cholinium glycolate, cholinium acetate, cholinium dihydrogencitrate, and cholinium lactate. Further studies are necessary on the ecotoxicology and biodegradability of DES, namely to evaluate their "green" character and their alternative capability to both classic solvents and ionic liquids.},

The instability of Hoogsteen base pairs at neutral pH has been a bottleneck in the progress of DNA nanobiotechnology, but the use of ILs will allow development of environmentfriendly DNA sensors.

The models were developed by careful parameterization of the solution phase partial charges to reproduce the experimental Kirkwood-Buff integrals for mixtures of solutes representative of the amino acid sidechains in solution. The KBFF parameters and simulated thermodynamic and structural properties are presented for the following eleven binary mixtures: benzene + methanol, benzene + toluene, toluene + methanol, toluene + phenol, toluene + p-cresol, pyrrole + methanol, indole + methanol, pyridine + methanol, pyridine + water, histidine + water, and histidine hydrochloride + water.

abstract = {Chloride (Cl-) and bicarbonate (HCO3-) are two major anions and their permeation through anion channels plays essential roles in our body. However, the mechanism of ion selection by the anion channels is largely unknown. Here, we provide evidence that pore dilatation increases the bicarbonate permeability (P HC O3/ Cl ) of anion channels by reducing energy barriers of size-exclusion and ion dehydration of HCO3- permeation. Molecular, physiological and computational analyses of major anion channels, such as cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), anoctamin-1(ANO1/TMEM16A) and the glycine receptor (GlyR), revealed that the ion selectivity of anion channels is basically determined by the electric permittivity and diameter of the pore. Importantly, cellular stimuli dynamically modulate the anion selectivity of CFTR and ANO1 by changing the pore size. In addition, pore dilatation by a mutation in the pore-lining region alters the anion selectivity of GlyR. Changes in pore size affected not only the energy barriers of size exclusion but that of ion dehydration by altering the electric permittivity of water-filled cavity in the pore. The dynamic increase in P HC O3/ Cl by pore dilatation may have many physiological and pathophysiological implications ranging from epithelial HCO3- secretion to neuronal excitation.},

In these DESs the molar ratio of choline chloride to urea, ethylene glycol and glycerol is 1:2. Results showed that the polarity and hydrogen bond donor ability of the DESs decreases with increasing mole fraction of dimethyl sulfoxide as a molecular solvent, while hydrogen bond acceptor ability of the media increases with mole fraction of DMSO. Deviation from ideal behavior, observed for solvatochromic parameters, confirmed preferential solvation of the solutes in these media. On the other hand, molecular dynamic simulations and quantum mechanics calculations concluded interaction energies between DES components and showed clearly different compositions in the solvation shells of the solutes in the solvent mixtures.},

A quantitative understanding of the relationship would facilitate more systematic procedures for manipulating the properties in a process environment. In this work the molecular basis for the osmotic second virial coefficient, B22, is studied; osmotic effects are critical in membrane transport, and the value of B22 has also been shown to correlate with protein crystallization behavior. The calculations here account for steric, electrostatic, and short-range interactions, with the structural and functional anisotropy of the protein molecules explicitly accounted for. The orientational dependence of the protein interactions is seen to have a pronounced effect on the calculations; in particular, the relatively few protein-protein configurations in which the apposing surfaces display geometric complementarity contribute disproportionately strongly to B22. The importance of electrostatic interactions is also amplified in these high- complementarity configurations. The significance of molecular recognition in determining B22 can explain the correlation with crystallization behavior, and it suggests that alteration of local molecular geometry can help in manipulating protein solution behavior. The results also have implications for the role of protein interactions in biological self-organization.},

Here we report the cryo-EM 3D structure of the human Bact spliceosome at 3.4 {\AA} resolution. In the Bact state, the spliceosome is activated but not catalytically primed, so that it is functionally blocked prior to the first catalytic step of splicing. The spliceosomal core is similar to the yeast Bact spliceosome; important differences include the presence of the RNA helicase aquarius and peptidyl prolyl isomerases. To examine the overall dynamic behavior of the purified spliceosome, we developed a principal component analysis-based approach. Calculating the energy landscape revealed eight major conformational states, which we refined to higher resolution. Conformational differences of the highly flexible structural components between these eight states reveal how spliceosomal components contribute to the assembly of the spliceosome, allowing it to generate a dynamic interaction network required for its subsequent catalytic activation. A new approach to analyzing cryo-EM data reports on conformational dynamics in the human spliceosome.},

abstract = {The outlier flooding method (OFLOOD) has been proposed as an enhanced conformational sampling method of proteins. In OFLOOD, rarely occurring states of proteins are detected as sparse conformational distributions (outliers) with a clustering algorithm. The detected outliers are intensively resampled with short-time molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. As a set of cycles, OFLOOD repeats selections of outliers and their conformational resampling. Herein, as an essential issue to be tackled to perform OFLOOD efficiently, a selection rule for outliers should be carefully specified. Generally, many outliers are detected from distributions on conformational subspaces with the clustering. Judging from its computational costs, it is unreasonable to select all the detected outliers upon the conformational resampling. Therefore, it is important to consider which outliers should be selected from the sparse distributions when restarting their short-time MD simulations with limited computational costs. In this sense, we investigated the conformational sampling efficiency of OFLOOD by changing the selection rules for outliers. To address the conformational sampling efficiency of OFLOOD depending on its selection rules, outliers to be resampled were selected by focusing their probability occurrences (populations of outliers). As a comparison, a random selection rule for outliers was also considered. Through the present assessment, the random selection of outliers showed the most efficient conformational sampling efficiency compared to the other OFLOOD trials using the biased selection rules, indicating that a variety of outliers should be selected and resampled during the OFLOOD cycles. In conclusion, the random outlier selection rule is the best strategy to perform OFLOOD efficiently.},

In this Symposium Review, we aim to demonstrate the ongoing impact of Hodgkin's and Huxley's ideas. The Hodgkin-Huxley model established a framework in which to describe the structural and functional properties of ion channels, including the mechanisms of ion permeation, selectivity, and gating. At a cellular level, the model is used to understand the conditions that control both the rate and timing of action potentials, essential for neural encoding of information. Finally, the Hodgkin-Huxley formalism is central to computational neuroscience to understand both neuronal integration and circuit level information processing, and how these mechanisms might have evolved to minimize energy cost. {\textcopyright} 2012 the authors.},

Analysis of these transition functions for signatures of Markovian behavior is described. The method has been applied to an example problem that is based on an underlying Markov process. The example problem shows that when an instance of the process is analyzed under the assumption that the underlying states have been aggregated into macrostates, a procedure known as lumping, the resulting chain appears to have been produced by a non-Markovian process when viewed at high temporal resolution. However, when viewed on longer time scales, and for appropriately lumped macrostates, Markovian behavior can be recovered. The potential for extracting the long time scale behavior of the folding process from a large number of short, independent molecular dynamics simulations is also explored.},

abstract = {We present two new implementations of the virtual sites technique which completely suppresses the degrees of freedom of the hydrogen atoms in a lipid bilayer allowing for an increased time step of 5 fs in all-atom simulations of the CHARMM36 force field. One of our approaches uses the derivation of the virtual sites used in GROMACS while the other uses a new definition of the virtual sites of the CH2 groups. Our methods is tested on a DPPC (no unsaturated chain), a POPC (one unsaturated chain), and a DOPC (two unsaturated chains) lipid bilayers. We calculate various physical properties of the membrane of our simulations with and without virtual sites and explain the differences and similarity observed. The best agreements are obtained for the GROMACS original virtual sites on the DOPC bilayer where we get an area per lipid of 67.3 ± 0.3 A˚2 without virtual sites and 67.6 ± 0.3 A˚2 with virtual sites. In conclusion the virtual-sites technique on lipid membranes is a powerful simulation tool, but it should be used with care. The procedure can be applied to other force fields and lipids in a straightforward manner. (Figure Presented).},

In the discovery setting 'the rule of 5' predicts that poor absorption or permeation is more likely when there are more than 5 H-bond donors, 10 H-bond acceptors, the molecular weight (MWT) is greater than 500 and the calculated Log P (CLogP) is greater than 5 (or MlogP{\textgreater}4.15). Computational methodology for the rule-based Moriguchi Log P (MLogP) calculation is described. Turbidimetric solubility measurement is described and applied to known drugs. High throughput screening (HTS) leads tend to have higher MWT and Log P and lower turbidimetric solubility than leads in the pre-HTS era. In the development setting, solubility calculations focus on exact value prediction and are difficult because of polymorphism. Recent work on linear free energy relationships and Log P approaches are critically reviewed. Useful predictions are possible in closely related analog series when coupled with experimental thermodynamic solubility measurements. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {A familiar problem is here viewed from an unfamiliar angle. The familiar problem is the Euthyphro dilemma: if God wills something because it is good, then goodness is independent of God, so God becomes, morally speaking, de trop. On the other hand, if something is good because God wills it, then, given the absence of constraint on what God may will, moral truths are – counterintuitively – contingent. An examination of the kinds of necessity and possibility at work in this conundrum leads us to the most promising solution: there is a metaphysical connection between God and goodness. What he wills is an expression of his nature. But (and this is the unfamiliar angle), that solution now poses an acute problem for an understanding of the Incarnation. For if God is constitutive of goodness, and Christ is God incar- nate, then Christ is constitutive of goodness. But Christ, as a human, is subject to external moral evaluation and obligation, which entails that he is not constitutive of goodness. This meta- ethical difficulty is not easily met by the usual strategies by which Christ is understood to have two natures. Reflection on our moral relations to our past selves, however, suggests a way forward.},

The parameters are developed in a hierarchical fashion using model compounds containing the key atoms in the full carbohydrates. Target data for parameter optimization included full two-dimensional energy surfaces defined by the glycosidic dihedral angle pairs in the phosphate/sulfate model compound analogs of hexopyranose monosaccharide phosphates and sulfates, as determined by quantum mechanical (QM) MP2/cc-pVTZ single point energies on MP2/6-31+G(d) optimized structures. In order to achieve balanced, transferable dihedral parameters for the dihedral angles, surfaces for all possible anomeric and conformational states were included during the parametrization process. In addition, to model physiologically relevant systems, both the mono- and dianionic charged states were studied for the phosphates. This resulted in over 7000 MP2/cc-pVTZ//MP2/6-31G+(d) model compound conformational energies which, supplemented with QM geometries, were the main target data for the parametrization. Parameters were validated against crystals of relevant monosaccharide derivatives obtained from the Cambridge Structural Database (CSD) and larger systems, namely inositol-(tri/tetra/penta) phosphates noncovalently bound to the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain and oligomeric chondroitin sulfate in solution and in complex with cathepsin K protein. {\textcopyright} 2011 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {Extractive desulfurization of liquid fuel is a simple process that requires minimum energy input and can be operated via existing liquid-liquid extraction apparatuses. In particular, to achieve deep desulfurization, the conventional hydrodesulfurization (HDS) process has shown limitations in the removal of aromatic sulfur compounds. Recently, extractive desulfurization using a new type of nonvolatile solvent, ionic liquids (ILs), has yielded promising results. However, there is a lack of systematic evaluation of the effect of IL structure on desulfurization efficiency, and a lack of mechanistic understanding regarding how ILs lead to the partition of aromatic sulfur compounds from fuel to the IL phase. The present study examines a total of 71 ILs and two deep eutectic solvents (DESs) with combinations representing various cations and anions. We identify a number of ILs that yield high partition coefficients [up to 1.85 mg(S) kg (IL)-1/mg(S) kg (oil)-1] for the partition of aromatic sulfur compounds between ILs and n-octane or n-dodecane as surrogates for gasoline or diesel, respectively. We find that the high sulfur partition coefficient correlates with a high dipolarity/polarizability ($\pi$∗) or a low solvent polarizability (SP) of ILs carrying the same cation and different anions, but correlates with a low dipolarity/polarizability ($\pi$∗) for ILs carrying the same anion paired to cations bearing different alkyl chain lengths. We further demonstrate that a four-step extraction using ILs can achieve 99{\%} dibenzothiophene (DBT) removal (i.e., an initial sulfur content of 500 ppm is reduced to {\textless}5 ppm following extraction).},

The first person to use the word "geography" was Eratosthenes (276-194 BC). Four historical traditions in geographical research are the spatial analysis of the natural and the human phenomena (geography as the study of distribution), the area studies (places and regions), the study of the man-land relationship, and the research in the earth sciences.[3] Nonetheless, the modern geography is an all-encompassing discipline that foremost seeks to understand the Earth and all of its human and natural complexities—not merely where objects are, but how they have changed and come to be. Geography has been called "the world discipline" and "the bridge between the human and the physical science". Geography is divided into two main branches: the human geography and the physical geography.[4][5][6]},

abstract = {We have developed an enhanced conformational sampling method combining replica-exchange umbrella sampling (REUS) with Gaussian accelerated molecular dynamics (GaMD). REUS enhances the sampling along predefined reaction coordinates, while GaMD accelerates the conformational dynamics by adding a boost potential to the system energy. The method, which we call GaREUS (Gaussian accelerated replica-exchange umbrella sampling), enhances the sampling more efficiently than REUS or GaMD, while the computational resource for GaREUS is the same as that required for REUS. The two-step reweighting procedure using the multistate Bennett acceptance ratio method and the cumulant expansion for the exponential average is applied to the simulation trajectories for obtaining the unbiased free-energy landscapes. We apply GaREUS to the calculations of free-energy landscapes for three different cases: conformational equilibria of N-glycan, folding of chignolin, and conformational change of adenyl kinase. We show that GaREUS speeds up the convergences of free-energy calculations using the same amount of computational resources as REUS. The free-energy landscapes reweighted from the trajectories of GaREUS agree with previously reported ones. GaREUS is applicable to free-energy calculations of various biomolecular dynamics and functions with reasonable computational costs.},

abstract = {Correlated motions in biomolecules are often essential for their function, for example, allosteric signal transduction or mechanical/thermodynamic energy transport. Principal component analysis (PCA) is a widely used method to extract functionally relevant collective motions from a molecular dynamics (MD) trajectory. Being based on the covariance matrix, however, PCA detects only linear correlations. Here we present a new method, full correlation analysis (FCA), which is based on mutual information and thus quantifies all correlations, including nonlinear and higher order correlations. For comparison, we applied both, PCA and FCA, to ∼100 ns MD trajectories of T4 lysozyme and the hexapeptide neurotensin. For both systems, FCA yielded better resolved conformational substates and aligned its modes more often with actual transition pathways. This improved resolution is shown to be due to a strongly increased anharmonicity of FCA modes as compared to the respective PCA modes. The high anharmonicity further suggests that the motions extracted by FCA are functionally more relevant than those captured by PCA. In summary, FCA should provide improved collective degrees of freedom for dimension-reduced descriptions of macromolecular dynamics. {\textcopyright} 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

abstract = {The last decade has witnessed developments in the CF drug pipeline which are both exciting and unprecedented, bringing with them previously unconsidered challenges. The Task Force group came together to consider these challenges and possible strategies to address them. Over the last 18 months, we have discussed internally and gathered views from a broad range of individuals representing patient organizations, clinical and research teams, the pharmaceutical industry and regulatory agencies. In this and the accompanying article, we discuss two main areas of focus: i) optimising trial design and delivery for speed/efficiency; ii) drug development for patients with rare CFTR mutations. We propose some strategies to tackle the challenges ahead and highlight areas where further thought is needed. We see this as the start of a process rather than the end and hope herewith to engage the wider community in seeking solutions to improved treatments for all patients with CF.},

abstract = {Deep eutectic solvents (DES) have emerged in the past few years as a new class of solvents with promising applications in several fields. In the present work, the application of DES (formed by binary mixtures of cholinium chloride and carboxylic acids or urea) as phase-forming components of aqueous biphasic systems (ABS) is investigated. The mechanisms associated with the phases demixing of ABS composed of DES, as well as the DES stability in aqueous solutions, are investigated to address the critical question whether DES-based ABS are in fact ternary or quaternary mixtures. It is shown that the DES integrity is destroyed in ABS by the disruption of the hydrogen-bonding interactions of the complex (a result of the isolated components preferential solvation by water), and as confirmed by a nonstoichiometric partition of the DES components between the coexisting phases. As a result, there are no "real" DES-based ABS; instead, there is the formation of ABS composed of four components, where the carboxylic acid used as the hydrogen-bond donor species seems to act as an additive. Finally, it is shown that these ABS have an outstanding potential to be used in extraction processes, as it is here demonstrated with the complete separation of two dyes. However, the volatile nature of short chain carboxylic acids and the nonstoichiometric partition of the DES components in ABS make the development of recovery and recycling steps more difficult to accomplish.},

abstract = {Post-translational modifications (PTMs) play a key role in numerous cellular processes by directly affecting structure, dynamics and interaction networks of target proteins. Despite their importance, our understanding of protein PTMs at the atomistic level is still largely incomplete. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, which provide high-resolution insight into biomolecular function and underlying mechanisms, are in principle ideally suited to tackle this problem. However, because of the challenges associated with the development of novel MD parameters and a general lack of suitable computational tools for incorporating PTMs in target protein structures, MD simulations of post-translationally modified proteins have historically lagged significantly behind the studies of unmodified proteins. Here, we present Vienna-PTM web server (http://vienna-ptm.univie.ac.at), a platform for automated introduction of PTMs of choice to protein 3D structures (PDB files) in a user-friendly visual environment. With 256 different enzymatic and non-enzymatic PTMs available, the server performs geometrically realistic introduction of modifications at sites of interests, as well as subsequent energy minimization. Finally, the server makes available force field parameters and input files needed to run MD simulations of modified proteins within the framework of the widely used GROMOS 54A7 and 45A3 force fields and GROMACS simulation package.},

abstract = {VX-770 (ivacaftor) is approved for clinical use in CF patients bearing multiple CFTR mutations. VX-770 potentiated wildtype CFTR and several disease mutants expressed in oocytes in a manner modulated by PKA-mediated phosphorylation. Potentiation of some other mutants, including G551D-CFTR, was less dependent upon the level of phosphorylation, likely related to the severe gating defects in these mutants exhibited in part by a shift in PKA sensitivity to activation, possibly due to an electrostatic interaction of D551 with K1250. Phosphorylation-dependent potentiation of wildtype CFTR and other variants also was observed in epithelial cells. Hence, the efficacy of potentiators may be obscured by a ceiling effect when drug screening is performed under strongly phosphorylating conditions. These results should be considered in campaigns for CFTR potentiator discovery, and may enable the expansion of VX-770 to CF patients bearing ultra-orphan CFTR mutations.},

It presents some of the key facts, figures, concepts, and debates on international migration that appear in the arti- cles that follow, and outlines their main arguments. Five arguments in sup- port of greater international cooperation and more formal processes of global governance on international migration are presented here. First, contemporary international migration is now occurring at unprecedented levels and has a truly global reach. Second, international migration can no longer effectively bemanaged or controlled by nationalmigration policies, and greater international cooperation is required to achieve national goals in international migration. Third, there are growing numbers of migrants around the world who are vulnerable and exploited, and insufficiently pro- tected by either states or international institutions. Fourth, emerging struc- tural features in the global economy, alongside the effects of climate change, are likely to significantly increase the scale of internationalmigrationworld- wide, and present new management and protection challenges. Finally, mo- mentumfor change is slowly developing. KEYWORDS: internationalmigration, global governance.},

Based on large-scale molecular dynamics simulations, we provide a high-resolution view of the lipid organization of a plasma membrane at an unprecedented level of complexity. Our plasma membrane model consists of 63 different lipid species, combining 14 types of headgroups and 11 types of tails asymmetrically distributed across the two leaflets, closely mimicking an idealized mammalian plasma membrane. We observe an enrichment of cholesterol in the outer leaflet and a general non-ideal lateral mixing of the different lipid species. Transient domains with liquid-ordered character form and disappear on the microsecond time scale. These domains are coupled across the two membrane leaflets. In the outer leaflet, distinct nanodomains consisting of gangliosides are observed. Phosphoinositides show preferential clustering in the inner leaflet. Our data provide a key view on the lateral organization of lipids in one of lifes fundamental structures, the cell membrane.},

abstract = {We performed molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to study the structure and dynamics of the deep eutectic solvent (DES) choline iodide-glycerol (CI.G) at a molar ratio of 1:3, inside slitlike titania [rutile (110)] and graphitic nanopores of width H = 5.2 and 2.5 nm, and at a temperature T = 333 K. DESs share many of the remarkable properties of ionic liquids (ILs) while being more inexpensive; furthermore, and in addition to their fundamental scientific interest, the systems modeled here are relevant to dye-sensitized solar cells and gas separations. Our results show that glycerol can form stable hydrogen bonds with the oxygen atoms in the rutile walls, which account for ∼86{\%} of the total number of hydrogen bonds involving DES species (choline, iodide, and glycerol) in the first layers (near the rutile walls), and for ∼24{\%} of the total hydrogen bonds observed for the DES inside a rutile pore of width H = 5.2 nm. As a result, in these systems, the rutile walls are coated by glycerol layers that are almost depleted of ions, have a liquid structure that departs from that of the bulk DES, and have very slow dynamics. In contrast, for DES inside graphitic pores, all species are present in the first layers near the carbon walls, the local liquid structure everywhere is similar to that of a bulk DES, and the overall dynamics are faster than those observed inside rutile pores of the same pore size; however, the DES species in the center of both rutile and graphitic pores have comparable mobilities. When the pore size is reduced, a larger proportion of the hydrogen bonds involve the walls (in the case of a rutile pore), the overall dynamics of the confined DES become slower, and in general the hydrogen bonds formed are present during longer times in the simulation trajectories. These observations are in general similar to the results obtained by us for the IL [EMIM+][TFMSI-] inside the same rutile and graphitic pores; however, both of the IL ions are present in the layers near the walls, and the ions in the center of a rutile pore have dynamics that were 2-4 times slower than those observed for the same ions in the center of a graphitic pore.},

abstract = {The nanoscopic characteristics and macroscopic physicochemical properties of choline chloride:levulinic acid (1:2 mole ratio) deep eutectic solvent are analyzed from molecular dynamics simulations. Considering the ionic character of some of the involved molecules, the influence of several charge schemes in the applied force field parameterization was studied. Assessed charge schemes include atomic charges obtained from wavefunctions (Mulliken, NPA, L{\"{o}}wdin, Mayer), electrostatic potentials (ChelpG, MK), spectroscopic data (APT) and partitioning of the electronic densities (Hirshfeld, VDD, AIM). Molecular dynamics simulations were carried out using these ten charge schemes with the remaining force field parameters being constant. The reported results show the remarkable role of the used charges in the results from molecular dynamics simulations, with large differences both in the predicted macroscopic properties. This work shows the need of using suitable charge models for developing reliable and accurate molecular dynamics simulations of deep eutectic solvent structuring. Charges from electrostatic potentials along to cluster approach should be the most adequate option for developing force field parameterization in deep eutectic solvents.},

The aim of this in vitro study was to evaluate the effect of ivacaftor on mutant CFTR protein forms with defects in protein processing and/or channel function. Methods: The effect of ivacaftor on CFTR function was tested in electrophysiological studies using a panel of Fischer rat thyroid (FRT) cells expressing 54 missense CFTR mutations that cause defects in the amount or function of CFTR at the cell surface. Results: Ivacaftor potentiated multiple mutant CFTR protein forms that produce functional CFTR at the cell surface. These included mutant CFTR forms with mild defects in CFTR processing or mild defects in CFTR channel conductance. Conclusions: These in vitro data indicated that ivacaftor is a broad acting CFTR potentiator and could be used to help stratify patients with CF who have different CFTR genotypes for studies investigating the potential clinical benefit of ivacaftor. {\textcopyright} 2013 European Cystic Fibrosis Society.},

abstract = {From macroscopic measurements of deep eutectic solvents such as glyceline (1:2 molar ratio of choline chloride to glycerol), the long-range translational diffusion of the larger cation (choline) is known to be slower compared to that of the smaller hydrogen bond donor (glycerol). However, when the diffusion dynamics are analyzed on the subnanometer length scale, we find that the displacements associated with the localized diffusive motions are actually larger for choline. This counterintuitive diffusive behavior can be understood as follows. The localized diffusive motions confined in the transient cage of neighbor particles, which precede the cage-breaking long-range diffusion jumps, are more spatially constrained for glycerol than for choline because of the stronger hydrogen bonds the former makes with chloride anions. The implications of such differential localized mobility of the constituents should be especially important for applications where deep eutectic solvents are confined on the nanometer length scale and their long-range translational diffusion is strongly inhibited (e.g., within microporous media).},

abstract = {Understanding the functional consequence of rare Cystic Fibrosis (CF) mutations is mandatory for the adoption of precision therapeutic approaches for CF. Here we studied the effect of the very rare CF mutation, W361R, on CFTR processing and function. We applied western blot, patch clamp and pharmacological modulators of CFTR to study the maturation and ion transport properties of pEGFP-WT and mutant CFTR constructs, W361R, F508del and L69H-CFTR, expressed in HEK293 cells. Structural analyses were also performed to study the molecular environment of the W361 residue. Western blot showed that W361R-CFTR was not efficiently processed to a mature band C, similar to F508del CFTR, but unlike F508del CFTR, it did exhibit significant transport activity at the cell surface in response to cAMP agonists. Importantly, W361R-CFTR also responded well to CFTR modulators: its maturation defect was efficiently corrected by VX-809 treatment and its channel activity further potentiated by VX-770. Based on these results, we postulate that W361R is a novel class-2 CF mutation that causes abnormal protein maturation which can be corrected by VX-809, and additionally potentiated by VX-770, two FDA-approved small molecules. At the structural level, W361 is located within a class-2 CF mutation hotspot that includes other mutations that induce variable disease severity. Analysis of the 3D structure of CFTR within a lipid environment indicated that W361, together with other mutations located in this hotspot, is at the edge of a groove which stably accommodates lipid acyl chains. We suggest this lipid environment impacts CFTR folding, maturation and response to CFTR modulators.},

abstract = {Simulations of biological macromolecules are important in understanding the physical basis of complex processes such as protein folding. However, even with increasing computational capacity and specialized architectures, the ability to simulate protein folding at atomistic scales still remains challenging. This stems from the dual aspects of high dimensionality of protein conformational landscapes, and the inability of atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to sufficiently sample these landscapes to observe folding events. Machine learning/deep learning (ML/DL) techniques, when combined with atomistic MD simulations offer the opportunity to potentially overcome these limitations by: (1) effectively reducing the dimensionality of MD simulations to automatically build latent representations that correspond to biophysically relevant reaction coordinates (RCs), and (2) driving MD simulations to automatically sample potentially novel conformational states based on these RCs. We examine how coupling DL approaches with MD simulations can lead to effective approaches to fold small proteins on supercomputers. In particular, we study the computational costs and effectiveness of scaling DL-coupled MD workflows implemented using RADICAL-Cybertools in folding two prototypical systems, namely Fs-peptide and the fast-folding variant of the villin head piece protein. We demonstrate that a DL-coupled MD workflow is able to effectively learn latent representations and drive adaptive simulations. Compared to traditional MD-based approaches, our approach achieves an effective performance gain in sampling the folded states by at least 2.3x. Together, our study provides quantitative basis to understand how coupling DL approaches to MD simulations, can lead to effective performance gains and reduced times to solution on supercomputing resources.},

abstract = {Understanding the energetics of peripheral protein-membrane interactions is important to many areas of biophysical chemistry and cell biology. Estimating free-energy landscapes by molecular dynamics (MD) simulation is challenging for such systems, especially when membrane recognition involves complex lipids, e.g., phosphatidylinositol phosphates (PIPs). We combined coarse-grained MD simulations with umbrella sampling to quantify the binding of the well-explored GRP1 pleckstrin homology (PH) domain to model membranes containing PIP molecules. The experimentally observed preference of GRP1-PH for PIP3 over PIP2 was reproduced. Mutation of a key residue (K273A) within the canonical PIP-binding site significantly reduced the free energy of PIP binding. The presence of a noncanonical PIP-interaction site, observed experimentally in other PH domains but not previously in GRP1-PH, was also revealed. These studies demonstrate how combining coarse-grained simulations and umbrella sampling can unmask the molecular basis of the energetics of interactions between peripheral membrane proteins and complex cellular membranes.},

abstract = {In contrast to ordinary polymers, the vast majority of biological macromolecules adopt highly ordered three-dimensional structures that define their functions. The key to folding of a biopolymer into a unique 3D structure or to an assembly of several biopolymers into a functional unit is a delicate balance between the attractive and repulsive forces that also makes such self-assembly reversible under physiological conditions. The all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) method has emerged as a powerful tool for studies of individual biomolecules and their functional assemblies, encompassing systems of ever increasing complexity. However, advances in parallel computing technology have outpaced the development of the underlying theoretical models - the molecular force fields, pushing the MD method into an untested territory. Recent tests of the MD method have found the most commonly used molecular force fields to be out of balance, overestimating attractive interactions between charged and hydrophobic groups, which can promote artificial aggregation in MD simulations of multi-component protein, nucleic acid, and lipid systems. One route towards improving the force fields is through the NBFIX corrections method, in which the intermolecular forces are calibrated against experimentally measured quantities such as osmotic pressure by making atom pair-specific adjustments to the non-bonded interactions. In this article, we review development of the NBFIX (Non-Bonded FIX) corrections to the AMBER and CHARMM force fields and discuss their implications for MD simulations of electrolyte solutions, dense DNA systems, Holliday junctions, protein folding, and lipid bilayer membranes.},

abstract = {MLN4924 is an experimental cancer drug known as inhibitor of NEDD8-activating enzyme (NAE). This anti-tumor candidate is a selective small-molecule inhibitor of NAE which is conjugated to cullin protein on Cullin-RING ligases (CRLs). This covalent modification actives cullin complex to recruit an ubiquitin-charged E2 and leads to downstream target protein polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. MLN4924, which can form a covalent adduct with NEDD8, and block NAE at the first step in this pathway, has shown anti-tumor activity in many kinds of cancer cell lines and also xenograft models, including lung cancer, colon cancer, melanoma and lymphoma. The anti-tumor activity of MLN4924 results from inactivation of CLRs, which causes DNA re-replication and inhibition of nuclear factor (NF)-$\kappa$B signaling, thus leading to cancer cell death. A mutation can reduce the enzyme's sensitivity to MLN4924. Verma et al. in 2013 studied on molecular dynamics simulation of a mutant A171T and consequently found out that this mutation reduce MLN4924 interaction with DNA Binding site of enzyme as a result of reduction of enzyme affinity to ATP. One year later, in 2014, Wei Xu et al. carried out a research on inhibitor resistant cell lines and revealed that a couple of mutations so called Y352H and I310N leads to enzyme resistance to MLN4924 inhibitor, interestingly, the cause reported was the increase of enzyme affinity to ATP. As in Wei Xu et al. experiment the molecular dynamics simulation was not considered, present study is conducted to identify enzyme mutation mechanism by molecular dynamics approach using advantages of Gromacs software version 4.5.6.},

The competition between different probes and water molecules allows the identification of the energetic preference of functional groups in different binding site moieties including enthalpic and entropic contributions. Cosolvent MD simulations have recently been applied to a variety of different questions in structure-based drug design but still have significant shortcomings. Among those issues is the limited chemical diversity of probe molecules ignoring the chemical context of the pharmacophoric feature represented by a probe. Here we present a novel cosolvent MD simulation method based on the $\lambda$-dynamics simulation concept that significantly increases the chemical diversity of functional groups investigated during cosolvent simulations. Application to four different test cases highlights the utility of the new approach to identify binding preferences of different functional groups and to correctly rank ligand series that differ by their substitution patterns.},

abstract = { The amino sugar N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) is well known for the important structural roles that it plays at the cell surface. It is a key component of bacterial cell wall peptidoglycan, fungal cell wall chitin, and the extracellular matrix of animal cells. Interestingly, recent studies have also identified new roles for GlcNAc in cell signaling. For example, GlcNAc stimulates the human fungal pathogen Candida albicans to undergo changes in morphogenesis and expression of virulence genes. Pathogenic E. coli responds to GlcNAc by altering the expression of fimbriae and CURLI fibers that promote biofilm formation and GlcNAc stimulates soil bacteria to undergo changes in morphogenesis and production of antibiotics. Studies with animal cells have revealed that GlcNAc influences cell signaling through the posttranslational modification of proteins by glycosylation. O-linked attachment of GlcNAc to Ser and Thr residues regulates a variety of intracellular proteins, including transcription factors such as NF $\kappa$ B, c-myc, and p53. In addition, the specificity of Notch family receptors for different ligands is altered by GlcNAc attachment to fucose residues in the extracellular domain. GlcNAc also impacts signal transduction by altering the degree of branching of N-linked glycans, which influences cell surface signaling proteins. These emerging roles of GlcNAc as an activator and mediator of cellular signaling in fungi, animals, and bacteria will be the focus of this paper. },

abstract = {Overexpression of telomerase is one of the hallmarks of human cancer. Telomerase is important for maintaining the integrity of the ends of chromosomes, which are called telomeres. A growing number of human disease syndromes are associated with organ failure caused by mutations in telomerase (hTERT or hTR). Mutations in telomerase lead to telomere shortening by decreasing the stability of the telomerase complex, reducing its accumulation, or directly affecting its enzymatic activity. In this work, potential human telomerase mutations were identified by a systematic computational approach. Moreover, molecular docking methods were used to predict the effects of these mutations on the affinity of certain ligands (C{\_}9i, C{\_}9k, 16A, and NSC749234). The C{\_}9k inhibitor had the best binding affinity for wild-type (WT) telomerase. Moreover, C{\_}9i and C{\_}9k had improved interactions with human telomerase in most of the mutant models. The R631 and Y717 residues of WT telomerase formed interactions with all studied ligands and these interactions were also commonly found in most of the mutant models. Residues forming stable interactions with ligands in molecular dynamics (MD) were traced, and the MD simulations showed that the C{\_}9k ligand formed different conformations with WT telomerase than the C{\_}9i ligand.},

abstract = {The most representative member of the Ras subfamily is its HRas isoform. Ras proteins being GTPases, possess an intrinsic activity to hydrolyze the GTP molecule to GDP. During the transition phases, between active and inactive states, P-loop and switch regions show maximum variations. Various hot-spot Ras mutants (G12 V, A59G, Q61L etc) have been reported, that limit the protein's conformation in the permanent active state. In the present study, we aim to explore the structural dynamics of one such crucial mutant of Ras namely A59G which belongs to the conserved Switch II region of the protein. Approximately ∼15 $\mu$s of Classical Molecular Dynamics (CMD) simulations have been carried out on the mutant and wild-type complexes. Further, a metadynamics simulation of 500 ns was also carried out, which suggests an energy barrier of ∼9.56 kcal/mol between wild-type and mutant conformation. We demonstrate the role of water molecule in maintaining the required interaction networks in the pre-hydrolysis state, its impact on A59G mutation, distinct orientation of the Gln61 residue in two conformations, disruption of crucial Gly60 and $\gamma$ phosphate and the change in the Switch II region. The outcome of our study captures the pre-hydrolysis state of the HRas protein. It also establishes the fact that this mutation makes the movement of Switch II region and the conserved DXXGQ motif highly constrained, which is known to be an important requirement for hydrolysis. This suggests that the A59G mutation may decrease the rate of intrinsic hydrolysis as well as GAP-mediated hydrolysis.},

abstract = {In this work, we present a series of fully atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to study lysozyme's orientation-dependent adsorption on polyethylene (PE) surface in explicit water. The simulations show that depending on the orientation of the initial approach to the surface the protein may adsorb or bounce from the surface. The protein may completely leave the surface or reorient and approach the surface resulting in adsorption. The success of the trajectory to adsorb on the surface is the result of different competing interactions, including protein-surface interactions and the hydration of the protein and the hydrophobic PE surface. The difference in the hydration of various protein sites affects the protein's orientation-dependent behavior. Side-on orientation is most likely to result in adsorption as the protein-surface exhibits the strongest attraction. However, adsorption can also happen when lysozyme's longest axis is tilted on the surface if the protein-surface interaction is large enough to overcome the energy barrier that results from dehydrating both the protein and the surface. Our study demonstrates the significant role of dehydration process on hydrophobic surface during protein adsorption. {\textcopyright} 2012 American Chemical Society.},

In particular, the number of water molecules required to fully surround each anion has been investigated. Monte Carlo calculations have been used in an attempt to find the solvated system X -(H 2O) n (X = F, Cl) with the lowest energy for each value of n. It is predicted that 18 water molecules are required to form a complete solvation shell around a Cl - anion, where "complete solvation" is interpreted as an ion that is completely surrounded by solvent molecules. Although fewer water molecules may fully solvate the Cl - anion, such structures are higher in energy than partially solvated molecules, up to n ≥ 18. Calculations on the F - anion suggest that 15 water molecules are required for a complete solvation shell. The EFP predictions are in good agreement with the relative energies predicted by ab initio energy calculations at the EFP geometries. {\textcopyright} 2005 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {Ionic liquids have been objects of extensive research for physical sorption of CO2 and a number of myths have been perpetuated in the literature, for lack of a critical analysis, concerning their potential for CO2 capture. This study carries a critical analysis of a number of widely accepted ideas and others not so well accepted that have been repeatedly expressed in the literature concerning the CO2 physical sorption in ionic liquids. Using the CO2 solubility in eicosane as benchmark, it will be shown that there is no evidence that ILs display a physical sorption of CO2 larger than n-alkanes when analyzed in adequate concentration units; the fluorination of the ions has no impact on the CO2 solubility and the oxygenation will marginally contribute to a decrease of the solubility. Ionic liquid-based deep eutectic systems are also shown to have a poor CO2 solubility. Although these widely used approaches to physically enhance the CO2 solubility in ILs do not seem to have any positive influence, this does not mean that other types of interaction cannot provide enhanced CO2 solubility as in the case of the anion [B(CN)4] confirmed here by a critical analysis of the published data. The mechanism of CO2 physical sorption in ionic liquids is discussed based on the results analyzed, supported by spectroscopic measurements and molecular simulations previously reported and further suggestions of possibilities for enhanced physical sorption based on fluorinated aromatic rings, other cyano based anions, mixtures with other ILs or solvents or the use of porous liquids are proposed.},

abstract = {In this paper, we combine two powerful computational techniques, wellered metadynamics and time-lagged independent component analysis. The aim is to develop a new tool for studying rare events and exploring complex free energy landscapes. Metadynamics is a well-established and widely used enhanced sampling method whose efficiency depends on an appropriate choice of collective variables. Often the initial choice is not optimal leading to slow convergence. However by analyzing the dynamics generated in one such run with a time-lagged independent component analysis and the techniques recently developed in the area of conformational dynamics, we obtain much more efficient collective variables that are also better capable of illuminating the physics of the system. We demonstrate the power of this approach in two paradigmatic examples.},

abstract = {Rab5 is a small GTPase and a key regulator in early endosomal trafficking. Rab5 and its effectors are involved in a large number of infectious diseases and certain types of cancer. We performed µs atomistic molecular dynamics simulations of inactive and active full-length Rab5 anchored to a complex model bilayer with composition of the early endosome membrane. Direct interactions between the Rab5 G domain and the bilayer were observed. We found two dominant nucleotide-dependent orientations characterised by a different accessibility of the switch regions. The “buried switch” orientation was mainly associated with inactive Rab5 accompanied with a rather extended structure of the hypervariable C-terminal region. Active Rab5 preferred an orientation in which the switch regions are accessible to effector proteins. These structural differences may provide an opportunity to selectively target one Rab5 state and lead to new approaches in the development of Rab5-specific therapies.},

@article{Schurhammer2000,
abstract = {We present a molecular dynamics study of the solvation properties of large spherical ions S+ and S- of same size, in water, chloroform and acetonitrile solutions, and at a water-chloroform interface. According to the 'extrathermodynamic' TATB hypothesis, such ions have identical free energies of transfer from water to any solvent. We find that this is not the case, because S- interacts better than S+ with water (by about 20 kcal mol-1), while S+ is better solvated by acetonitrile (by about 2 kcal mol-1) and chloroform (about 8 kcal mol-1) solvents. The importance of 'long-range' electrostatic interactions on the charge discrimination by solvent is demonstrated by the comparison of standard vs corrected methods to calculate: (i) the electrostatic potential at the centre of the solute; (ii) the interaction energies between the ions and the solvents; and (iii) the free energies of charging the neutral sphere S0 to S+ and S-, respectively. These conclusions are obtained with several solvent models and simulation conditions. The question of ion pairing for the S+S-, S+Cl- and S-Na+ pairs is also examined in the three solvents. Finally, simulations at a liquid-liquid water-chloroform interface represented explicitly, show that S+ and S- are highly surface active, although they do not possess, like classical surfactants, an amphiphilic topology. Adsorption at the interface is found with different methodologies and at different ion concentrations. These results are important in the context of the 'TATB hypothesis', and for our understanding of solvation of large hydrophobic ions in pure liquids or in heterogeneous liquid environments.

abstract = {Absolute single-ion thermodynamic quantities of hydration at 298.15 K are derivable from the conventional enthalpies and entropies if the values of S°(H(aq)+) and $\Delta$(hyd)H°(H+) are known. Here we suggest S°(H(aq)+) = - 5.5 J K-1 mol-1 based on the thermodynamics of the dissociation of water. This assignment, in turn, corresponds to $\Delta$(hyd)H°(H+) = -1078 kJ mol-1 according to a self-consistent analysis of Krestov. Using these values, as a main result, the anions are more strongly hydrated than usually thought, in line with recent calculations. Only the group 1, 2, and 15 nobel gas ions are dealt with. For each series, the conventional enthalpies and entropies are linearly related to one another. From these linear free energy relationships (LFERs) a relationship between S°(H(aq)+) and $\Delta$(hyd)H°(H+) is derived. Further, a connection is detected between the Born radii r(B), calculated from the free energies of hydration, and the distances d, corresponding to the upper limits of the experimental first peak position of the ion-oxygen radial distribution curves, upon implication, in the case of a cation, the covalent radius r(cov) of oxygen, and in the case of an anion, the water radius r(water), d(cation-oxygen) - r(cov)(O) ≃ r(B) d(anion-oxygen) - r(water) ≃ r(B) Finally, from the differences between the enthalpies and free energies of hydration the temperature derivatives of the Born radii are determined.},

The mutation affects the thermodynamic stability of the domain and the integrity of the interface between NBD1 and the transmembrane domain leading to its clearance by the quality control system. Here, we develop nanobodies targeting NBD1 of human CFTR and demonstrate their ability to stabilize both isolated NBD1 and full-length protein. Crystal structures of NBD1-nanobody complexes provide an atomic description of the epitopes and reveal the molecular basis for stabilization. Furthermore, our data uncover a conformation of CFTR, involving detachment of NBD1 from the transmembrane domain, which contrast with the compact assembly observed in cryo-EM structures. This unexpected interface rearrangement is likely to have major relevance for CF pathogenesis but also for the normal function of CFTR and other ABC proteins.},

Little is known on the differences in self-assembly mechanisms of functional and pathogenic (poly)peptides.

Particular emphasis is given to the challenges one faces to characterize at atomic level of detail the conformational space of disordered (poly)peptides and their aggregation.

Here, we study the formation of fibrils and oligomers by exon 1 of huntingtin protein. We show that the oligomer states are consistent with polymer micelles that are limited in size by the stretching entropy of the polyglutamine region. The model shows how the sequences flanking the amyloid core modulate aggregation behavior. The N17 region promotes aggregation through weakly attractive interactions, whereas the C38 tail opposes aggregation via steric repulsion. We also show that the energetics of cross-$\beta$ stacking by polyglutamine would produce fibrils with many alignment defects, but minor perturbations from the flanking sequences are sufficient to reduce the defects to the level observed in experiment. We conclude with a discussion of the implications of this model for other amyloid-forming molecules.},

While opening of TMEM16A requires binding of intracellular Ca2+, prolonged Ca2+-dependent activation results in channel desensitization or rundown, the mechanism of which is unclear. Here we show that phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate (PIP2) regulates TMEM16A channel activation and desensitization via binding to a putative binding site at the cytosolic interface of transmembrane segments (TMs) 3–5. We further demonstrate that the ion-conducting pore of TMEM16A is constituted of two functionally distinct modules: a Ca2+-binding module formed by TMs 6–8 and a PIP2-binding regulatory module formed by TMs 3–5, which mediate channel activation and desensitization, respectively. PIP2 dissociation from the regulatory module results in ion-conducting pore collapse and subsequent channel desensitization. Our findings thus provide key insights into the mechanistic understanding of TMEM16 channel gating and lipid-dependent regulation.},

In the gut, CFTR is crucial for maintaining fluid and acid-base homeostasis, and its activity is tightly controlled by multiple neuro-endocrine factors. However, microbial toxins can disrupt this intricate control mechanism and trigger protracted activation of CFTR. This results in the massive faecal water loss, metabolic acidosis and dehydration that characterize secretory diarrhoeas, a major cause of malnutrition and death of children under 5 years of age. Compounds that inhibit CFTR could improve emergency treatment of diarrhoeal disease. Drawing on recent structural and functional insight, we discuss how existing CFTR inhibitors function at the molecular and cellular level. We compare their mechanisms of action to those of inhibitors of related ABC transporters, revealing some unexpected features of drug action on CFTR. Although challenges remain, especially relating to the practical effectiveness of currently available CFTR inhibitors, we discuss how recent technological advances might help develop therapies to better address this important global health need.},

CFTR is a member of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) family of membrane transport proteins, most members of which function as ATP-dependent pumps. CFTR is unique among human ABC proteins in functioning not as a pump, but as an ion channel. Recent structural data has indicated that CFTR shares broadly similar overall architecture and ATP-dependent conformational changes as other ABC proteins. Functional investigations suggest that CFTR has a unique open portal connecting the cytoplasm to the transmembrane channel pore, that allows for a continuous pathway for Cl− ions to cross the membrane in one conformation. This lateral portal may be what allows CFTR to function as an ion channel rather than as a pump, suggesting a plausible mechanism by which channel function may have evolved in CFTR.},

Because cooperative H-bond fluctuations and ion migration complicate the straightforward interpretation of measured DR timescales in terms of molecular dipolar rotations for these conducting media which support extensive intra- and inter-species H-bonding, one needs to separate out the individual components from the overall relaxation for examining the microscopic origin of various timescales. The present study does so and finds that reorientation of ion-complexed acetamide molecules generates relaxation timescales that are in sub-nanosecond to nanosecond range. This explains in molecular terms the nanosecond timescales reported by recent giga-Hertz DR measurements. Interestingly, the simulated survival timescale for the acetamide-Li+ complex has been found to be a few tens of nanosecond, suggesting such a cation-complexed species may be responsible for a similar timescale reported by mega-Hertz DR measurements of acetamide/potassium thiocyanate deep eutectics near room temperature. The issue of collective versus single particle relaxation is discussed, and jump waiting time distributions are determined. Dependence on anion-identity in each of the cases has been examined. In short, the present study demonstrates that assumption of nano-sized domain formation is not required for explaining the DR detected nanosecond and longer timescales in these media.},

abstract = {Previously we showed that the functional activity of the epithelial chloride channel that is encoded by the cystic fibrosis gene (CFTR) is reciprocally modulated by two components of the vesicle fusion machinery, syntaxin 1A and Munc-18. Here we report that syntaxin 1A inhibits CFTR chloride channels by means of direct and domain-specific protein-protein interactions. Syntaxin 1A stoichiometrically binds to the N-terminal cytoplasmic tail of CFTR, and this binding is blocked by Munc-18. The modulation of CFTR currents by syntaxin 1A is eliminated either by deletion of this tail or by injecting this tail as a blocking peptide into coexpressing Xenopus oocytes. The CFTR binding site on syntaxin 1A maps to the third predicted helical domain (H3) of this membrane protein. Moreover, CFTR Cl- currents are effectively inhibited by a minimal syntaxin 1A construct (i.e., the membrane-anchored H3 domain) that cannot fully substitute for wild-type syntaxin 1A in membrane fusion reactions. We also show that syntaxin 1A binds to and inhibits the activities of disease- associated mutants of CFTR, and that the chloride current activity of recombinant $\Delta$F508 CFTR (i.e., the most common cystic fibrosis mutant) can be potentiated by disrupting its interaction with syntaxin 1A in cultured epithelial cells. Our results provide evidence for a direct physical interaction between CFTR and syntaxin 1A that limits the functional activities of normal and disease-associated forms of this chloride channel.},

abstract = {Post-translational modifications (PTMs) play a crucial role during biogenesis of many transmembrane proteins. Previously, it had not been possible to evaluate PTMs in cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), the epithelial ion channel responsible for cystic fibrosis, because of difficulty obtaining sufficient amounts of purified protein. We recently used an inducible overexpression strategy to generate recombinant CFTR protein at levels suitable for purification and detailed analysis. Using liquid chromatography (LC) tandem and multiple reaction ion monitoring (MRM) mass spectrometry, we identified specific sites of PTMs, including palmitoylation, phosphorylation, methylation and possible ubiquitination. Many of these covalent CFTR modifications have not been described previously, but are likely to influence key and clinically important molecular processes including protein maturation, gating and the mechanisms underlying certain mutations associated with disease. {\textcopyright} The Author 2011.},

We will attempt to paint a picture of how the channel conducts anions, as inferred from studies of channel function in the wild type and mutant proteins. On the one hand this picture is, of necessity, somewhat fuzzy at this time as the structure of the channel is unknown, even though the structures of homologous, non-channel relatives have been determined,16-19 as has that of a bacterial ClC channel.20,20a On the other hand, the pattern of anion selectivity that has emerged from studies of permeation and channel blockade offers some limited insights into the environment of the pore as experienced by visiting anions, and invites some speculations about the logic of anion channel design. The review will be selective rather than comprehensive and will focus on those studies that speak most directly to elements of pore design.},

abstract = {With the rise in diabetes mellitus cases worldwide and lack of patient adherence to glycemia management using injectable insulin, there is an urgent need for the development of efficient oral insulin formulations. However, the gastrointestinal tract presents a formidable barrier to oral delivery of biologics. Here we report the development of a highly effective oral insulin formulation using choline and geranate (CAGE) ionic liquid. CAGE significantly enhanced paracellular transport of insulin, while protecting it from enzymatic degradation and by interacting with the mucus layer resulting in its thinning. In vivo, insulin-CAGE demonstrated exceptional pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic outcome after jejunal administration in rats. Low insulin doses (3–10 U/kg) brought about a significant decrease in blood glucose levels, which were sustained for longer periods (up to 12 hours), unlike s.c. injected insulin. When 10 U/kg insulin-CAGE was orally delivered in enterically coated capsules using an oral gavage, a sustained decrease in blood glucose of up to 45{\%} was observed. The formulation exhibited high biocompatibility and was stable for 2 months at room temperature and for at least 4 months under refrigeration. Taken together, the results indicate that CAGE is a promising oral delivery vehicle and should be further explored for oral delivery of insulin and other biologics that are currently marketed as injectables.},

abstract = {Ion-specific solvation has fundamental implications in biochemistry, and the thermodynamics and dynamics of aqueous salt solutions have correspondingly been investigated intensively. Nonetheless, there are fundamental unresolved issues in modeling the dynamics of aqueous salt solutions and the related problem of polymers dissolved in these solutions. In particular, experiments show that the self-diffusion coefficient, D, of water molecules in electrolyte solutions can be either enhanced or suppressed by particular salts having the same valence where the observed changes correlate with the Hofmeister series governing the relative solubility of proteins and water-soluble polymers in the same salt solutions. Recent studies have demonstrated that common atomistic models of aqueous electrolyte solutions completely fail to reproduce this basic phenomenon. Drawing on similar trends observed in the field of polymer nanocomposites, we propose a coarse-grained model of aqueous electrolyte solutions that captures the observed trends and that offers physical insight into the influence of salt on the thermodynamic and dynamic properties of electrolyte solutions.},

abstract = {Extensive molecular dynamics (MD) simulations (∼70 ns total) with explicit solvent molecules and salt ions are carried out to probe the effects of temperature and salt concentration on the structural stability of the human Lymphotactin (hLtn). The distribution of ions near the protein surface and the stability of various structural motifs are observed to exhibit interesting dependence on the local sequence and structure. Whereas chloride association to the protein is overall enhanced as the temperature increases, the sodium distribution in the C-terminal helical region and, to a smaller degree, the chloride distribution in the same region are found higher at the lower temperature. The similar trend is also observed in nonlinear Poisson-Boltzmann calculations with a temperature-dependent water dielectric constant, once conformational averaging over a series of MD snapshots is done. The unexpected temperature dependence in the ion distribution is explained on the basis of the cancellation of association entropy for ion-side chain pairs of opposite-charge and like-charge characters, which have positive and negative contributions, respectively. The C-terminal helix is observed to partially melt whereas a short $\beta$ strand forms at the higher temperature with little salt dependence. The N-termal region, by contrast, develops partial helical structure at a higher salt concentration. These observed behaviors are consistent with solvent and salt screening playing an important role in stabilizing the canonical chemokine fold of hLtn. {\textcopyright} 2006 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {Quantum mechanics (QM) calculations are applied to examine 1H, 13C, 15N, and 31P chemical shifts of two phosphorylation sites in an intrinsically disordered protein region. The QM calculations employ a combination of (1) structural ensembles generated by molecular dynamics, (2) a fragmentation technique based on the adjustable density matrix assembler, and (3) density functional methods. The combined computational approach is used to obtain chemical shifts (i) in the S19 and S40 residues of the nonphosphorylated and (ii) in the pS19 and pS40 residues of the doubly phosphorylated human tyrosine hydroxylase 1 as the system of interest. We study the effects of conformational averaging and explicit solvent sampling as well as the effects of phosphorylation on the computed chemical shifts. Good to great quantitative agreement with the experiment is achieved for all nuclei, provided that the systematic error cancellation is optimized by the choice of a suitable NMR standard. The effect of the standard reference on the computed 15N and 31P chemical shifts is demonstrated by employing three different referencing methods. Error bars associated with the statistical averaging of the computed 31P chemical shifts are larger than the difference between the 31P chemical shift of pS19 and pS40. The sequence trend of 31P shifts therefore could not be reliably reproduced. On the contrary, the calculations correctly predict the change of the 13C chemical shift for CB induced by the phosphorylation of the serine residues. The present work demonstrates that QM calculations coupled with molecular dynamics simulations and fragmentation techniques can be used as an alternative to empirical prediction tools in the structure characterization of intrinsically disordered proteins.},

Using this method, free-energy barriers of individual collective variables are significantly reduced compared with simple force-field scaling. The introduced methodology is flexible and allows adaptive bias potentials to be self-consistently constructed for a large number of simple collective variables, such as distances and dihedral angles.

abstract = {Background: Ovarian granulosa cell tumors are the most common sex-cord stromal tumors and have juvenile (JGCTs) and adult forms. In a previous study we reported the occurrence of activating somatic mutations of G$\alpha$s, which transduces mitogenic signals, in 30{\%} of the analyzed JGCTs. Methods: We have searched for alterations in other proteins involved in ovarian mitogenic signaling. We focused on the PI3K-AKT axis. As we found mutations in AKT1, we analyzed the subcellular localization of the mutated proteins and performed functional explorations using Western-blot and luciferase assays. Findings: We detected in-frame duplications affecting the pleckstrin-homology domain of AKT1 in more than 60{\%} of the tumors occurring in girls under 15 years of age. The somatic status of the mutations was confirmed when peritumoral DNA was available. The JGCTs without duplications carried point mutations affecting highly conserved residues. Several of these substitutions were somatic lesions. The mutated proteins carrying the duplications had a non-wild-type subcellular distribution, with a marked enrichment at the plasma membrane. This led to a striking degree of AKT1 activation demonstrated by a strong phosphorylation level and by reporter assays. Interpretation: Our study incriminates somatic mutations of AKT1 as a major event in the pathogenesis of JGCTs. The existence of AKT inhibitors currently tested in clinical trials opens new perspectives for targeted therapies for these tumors, which are currently treated with standard non-specific chemotherapy protocols.},

Here, we suggest an approach for modeling the slow parts of Markov processes by approximating the dominant eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of the propagator. To this end, a variational principle is derived that is based on the maximization of a Rayleigh coefficient. It is shown that this Rayleigh coefficient can be estimated from statistical observables that can be obtained from short distributed simulations starting from different parts of state space. The approach forms a basis for the development of adaptive and efficient computational algorithms for simulating and analyzing metastable Markov processes while avoiding the sampling problem. Since any stochastic process with finite memory can be transformed into a Markov process, the approach is applicable to a wide range of processes relevant for modeling complex real-world phenomena. {\textcopyright} 2013 Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics.},

MLN4924 is a selective inhibitor of NAE currently in clinical trials for the treatment of cancer. Here, we show that MLN4924 is a mechanism-based inhibitor of NAE and creates a covalent NEDD8-MLN4924 adduct catalyzed by the enzyme. The NEDD8-MLN4924 adduct resembles NEDD8 adenylate, the first intermediate in the NAE reaction cycle, but cannot be further utilized in subsequent intraenzyme reactions. The stability of the NEDD8-MLN4924 adduct within the NAE active site blocks enzyme activity, thereby accounting for the potent inhibition of the NEDD8 pathway by MLN4924. Importantly, we have determined that compounds resembling MLN4924 demonstrate the ability to form analogous adducts with other ubiquitin-like proteins (UBLs) catalyzed by their cognate-activating enzymes.

abstract = {Consistent with its function as a chloride channel regulated entirely from the cytoplasmic side of the plasma membrane, the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) glycoprotein exposes little of its mass on the exterior surface of cells. The first and fourth extracytoplasmic loops (ELs) contain ∼15 and 30 residues, respectively; the other four ELs are extremely short. To examine the influence of missense mutants in ELs detected in patients with cystic fibrosis, we have expressed them in mammalian (baby hamster kidney (BHK21)) cells and assessed their biosynthetic processing and chloride channel activity. In contrast to previous findings that 18 of 30 disease-associated missense mutations in cytoplasmic loops caused retention of the nascent polypeptides in the endoplasmic reticulum, all the EL mutants studied matured and were transported to the cell surface. This pronounced asymmetry is consistent with the notion that endoplasmic reticulum quality control of nascent CFTR is exerted primarily on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane. Although this set of EL mutations has little effect on CFTR maturation, most of them seriously compromise its chloride channel activity. Substitutions at six different positions in EL1 and single positions in EL2 and EL4 all destabilized the open state, some of them severely, indicating that the ELs contribute to the stability of the CFTR ion pore.},

Pharmacological studies have identified both competitive and noncompetitive P-gp substrates, but neither the precise location of the substrate binding sites, nor the basis of competitive and noncompetitive interactions has been fully characterized. Here, potential of mean force (PMF) calculations are used to identify the transport-competent minimum free energy binding locations of five compounds, Hoechst 33342, Rhodamine 123, paclitaxel, tariquidar, and verapamil to P-gp. Unrestrained molecular dynamics simulations were also performed to confirm the substrates were stable in the energy wells determined using the PMF calculations. All compounds had energy minima within the P-gp transmembrane (TM) pore. For Hoechst 33342 and Rhodamine 123, a second minimum outside the TM pore was also identified. Based on this and previous studies of nicardipine and morphine [ Subramanian et al. J. Chem. Inf. Model. 2015, 55, 1202 ], a general scheme that accounts for the observed noncompetitive and competitive substrate interactions with P-gp is proposed.},

abstract = {The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) channel is an ion channel responsible for chloride transport in epithelia and it belongs to the class of ABC transporters. The deletion of phenylalanine 508 (F508del) in CFTR is the most common mutation responsible for cystic fibrosis. Little is known about the effect of the mutation in the isolated nucleotide binding domains (NBDs), on dimer dynamics, ATP hydrolysis and even on nucleotide binding. Using molecular dynamics simulations of the human CFTR NBD dimer, we showed that F508del increases, in the prehydrolysis state, the inter-motif distance in both ATP binding sites (ABP) when ATP is bound. Additionally, a decrease in the number of catalytically competent conformations was observed in the presence of F508del. We used the subtraction technique to study the first 300 ps after ATP hydrolysis in the catalytic competent site and found that the F508del dimer evidences lower conformational changes than the wild type. Using longer simulation times, the magnitude of the conformational changes in both forms increases. Nonetheless, the F508del dimer shows lower C-$\alpha$ RMS values in comparison to the wild-type, on the F508del loop, on the residues surrounding the catalytic site and the portion of NBD2 adjacent to ABP1. These results provide evidence that F508del interferes with the NBD dynamics before and after ATP hydrolysis. These findings shed a new light on the effect of F508del on NBD dynamics and reveal a novel mechanism for the influence of F508del on CFTR.},

abstract = {The magnitudes and distributions of subconductance states were studied in chloride channels formed by the wild-type cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) and in CFTRs bearing amino acid substitutions in transmembrane segment 6. Within an open burst, it was possible to distinguish three distinct conductance states referred to as the full conductance, subconductance 1, and subconductance 2 states. Amino acid substitutions in transmembrane segment 6 altered the duration and probability of occurrence of these subconductance states but did not greatly alter their relative amplitudes. Results from real time measurements indicated that covalent modification of single R334C-CFTR channels by [2-(trimethylammonium)ethyl]methanethiosulfonate resulted in the simultaneous modification of all three conductance levels in what appeared to be a single step, without changing the proportion of time spent in each state. This behavior suggests that at least a portion of the conduction path is common to all three conducting states. The time course for the modification of R334C-CFTR, measured in outside-out macropatches using a rapid perfusion system, was also consistent with a single modification step as if each pore contained only a single copy of the cysteine at position 334. These results are consistent with a model for the CFTR conduction pathway in which a single anion-conducting pore is formed by a single CFTR polypeptide.},

abstract = {P-glycoprotein (Pgp) is a biomedically important member of the ABC transporter superfamily that mediates multidrug resistance in various cancer types. Substrate binding and transport in Pgp are modulated by the presence of cholesterol in the membrane. Structural information on cholesterol binding sites and mechanistic details of its redistribution are, however, largely unknown. In this study, a set of 40 independent molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of Pgp embedded in cholesterol-rich lipid bilayers are reported, totaling 8 $\mu$s, enabling extensive sampling of cholesterol-protein interactions in Pgp. Clustering analyses of the ensemble of cholesterol molecules (∼5740) sampled around Pgp in these simulations reveal specific and asymmetric cholesterol-binding regions formed by the transmembrane (TM) helices TM1–6 and TM8. Notably, not all the putative cholesterol binding sites identified by MD can be predicted by the primary sequence based cholesterol-recognition amino acid consensus (CRAC) or inverted CRAC (CARC) motifs, an observation that we attribute to inadequacy of these motifs to account for binding sites formed by remote amino acids in the sequence that can still be spatially adjacent to each other. Binding of cholesterol to Pgp occurs more frequently through its rough $\beta$-face formed by the two protruding methyl groups, whereas the opposite smooth $\alpha$-face prefers packing alongside the membrane lipids. One full and two partial cholesterol flipping events between the two leaflets of the bilayer mediated by the surface of Pgp are also captured in these simulations. All flipping events are observed in a region formed by helices TM1, TM2, and TM11, featuring two full and two partial CRAC/CARC motifs, with Tyr49 and Tyr126 identified as key residues interacting with cholesterol during this event. Our study is the first to report direct observation of unconventional cholesterol translocation on the surface of Pgp, providing a secondary transport model for the known flippase activity of ABC exporters of cholesterol.

abstract = {Using both analytical solutions obtained from simplified systems and numerical results from more realistic cases, we investigate the role played by the dielectric constant of membrane proteins $\epsilon$p and pore water $\epsilon$w in permeation of ions across channels. We show that the boundary and its curvature are the crucial factors in determining how an ion's potential energy depends on the dielectric constants near an interface. The potential energy of an ion outside a globular protein has a dominant 1/$\epsilon$w dependence, but this becomes 1/$\epsilon$p for an ion inside a cavity. For channels, where the boundaries are in between these two extremes, the situation is more complex. In general, we find that variations in $\epsilon$w have a much larger impact on the potential energy of an ion compared to those in $\epsilon$p. Therefore a better understanding of the effective $\epsilon$w values employed in channel models is desirable. Although the precise value of $\epsilon$p is not a crucial determinant of ion permeation properties, it still needs to be chosen carefully when quantitative comparisons with data are made.},

This study explored the feasibility of such a study and the impact of one-week ivacaftor withdrawal. Methods: This open-label, single-arm study aimed to enrol 32 adults ≥18 years of age with CF and at least one p.Gly551Asp (G551D) mutation. Patients received three increasing GLPG1837 dosages twice-daily for two 7-day and one 14-day period following a one-week ivacaftor washout. The primary outcome was safety; secondary outcomes were changes in sweat chloride concentration, spirometry outcomes, and pharmacokinetics. Results: Twenty-six patients enrolled; 24 completed the study. Adverse events were reported by 53.8–76.9{\%} of patients (dosage-dependent), with respiratory adverse events most common. Mean sweat chloride concentrations decreased from 97.7 mmol/L (baseline) to 68.7 mmol/L (end of GLPG1837 treatment). In ivacaftor-pre-treated patients, mean sweat chloride concentrations rose from 42.5 mmol/L at screening to 98.5 mmol/L after ivacaftor washout. Levels were decreased following GLPG1837 treatment (to 68.8 mmol/L at treatment end). Percent predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 s declined from 73.3{\%} at screening to 68.5{\%} after ivacaftor washout but returned to screening level at treatment end (73.1{\%}). Conclusions: Patient willingness to participate in the study suggests that the need for a short period of ivacaftor withdrawal may not be a barrier to development of novel potentiators, such as GLPG1837. A one-week ivacaftor washout was generally well tolerated, but resulted in a decline in lung function, which was reversed with GLPG1837 treatment to pre-washout levels. Combined with the concentration-dependent decrease in sweat chloride concentration, results show that GLPG1837 increases CFTR activity in G551D-CF patients.

The large number of degrees of freedom and lack of symmetry pose a challenge to studying the chemical details of the HIV capsid. Simulations of over 64 million atoms for over 1 $\mu$s allow us to conduct a comprehensive study of the chemical-physical properties of an empty HIV-1 capsid, including its electrostatics, vibrational and acoustic properties, and the effects of solvent (ions and water) on the capsid. The simulations reveal critical details about the capsid with implications to biological function.},

abstract = {Molecular dynamics simulations of biomolecules produce a very high dimensional time-series dataset. Performing analysis necessarily involves projection onto a lower dimensional space. A priori selection of projection coordinates requires (perhaps unavailable) prior information or intuition about the system. At best, such a projection can only confirm the intuition. At worst, a poor projection can obscure new features of the system absent from the intuition. Previous statistical methods such a time-structure based independent component analysis (tICA) and Markov state modeling (MSMs) have offered relatively unbiased means of projecting conformations onto coordinates or state labels, respectively. These analyses are underpinned by the propagator formalism and the assumption that slow dynamics are biologically interesting. Although arising from the same mathematics, tICA and MSMs have different strengths and weaknesses. We introduce a unifying method which we term “landmark kernel tICA” (lktICA) which uses a variant of the Nystr{\"{o}}m kernel approximation to permit approximate non-linear solutions to the tICA problem. We show that lktICA is equivalent to MSMs with “soft” states. We demonstrate the advantages of this united method by finding improved projections of (a) a 1D potential surface (b) a peptide folding trajectory and (c) an ion channel conformational change.},

Such calculations are of particular importance in protein-ligand free-energy calculations. To meet this challenge, we have developed new free-energy techniques that combine the advantages of the replica-exchange method with free-energy perturbation (FEP) and finite-difference thermodynamic integration (FDTI). These new techniques are tested and compared with FEP, FDTI, and the adaptive umbrella weighted histogram analysis method (AdUmWHAM) on the challenging calculation of the relative hydration free energy of methane and water. This calculation involves a large solvent configurational change. Through the use of replica-exchange moves along the $\lambda$-coordinate, the configurations sampled along $\lambda$ are allowed to mix, which leads to dramatic improvements in solvent configurational sampling, an efficient reduction of random sampling error, and a reduction of general simulation error. This is achieved at effectively no extra computational cost, relative to standard FEP or FDTI.},

abstract = {The Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (CFTR) anion channel is essential for epithelial salt–water balance. CFTR mutations cause cystic fibrosis, a lethal incurable disease. In cells CFTR is activated through the cAMP signaling pathway, overstimulation of which during cholera leads to CFTR-mediated intestinal salt–water loss. Channel activation is achieved by phosphorylation of its regulatory (R) domain by cAMP-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (PKA). Here we show using two independent approaches––an ATP analog that can drive CFTR channel gating but is unsuitable for phosphotransfer by PKA, and CFTR mutants lacking phosphorylatable serines––that PKA efficiently opens CFTR channels through simple binding, under conditions that preclude phosphorylation. Unlike when phosphorylation happens, CFTR activation by PKA binding is completely reversible. Thus, PKA binding promotes release of the unphosphorylated R domain from its inhibitory position, causing full channel activation, whereas phosphorylation serves only to maintain channel activity beyond termination of the PKA signal. The results suggest two levels of CFTR regulation in cells: irreversible through phosphorylation, and reversible through R-domain binding to PKA––and possibly also to other members of a large network of proteins known to interact with the channel.},

However, the processes by which CFTR is regulated on the cell surface are not clear. Here we report the identification of a protein-protein interaction between CFTR and the cytoskeletal filamin proteins. Using proteomic approaches, we identified filamins as proteins that associate with the extreme CFTR N terminus. Furthermore, we identified a disease-causing missense mutation in CFTR, serine 13 to phenylalanine (S13F), which disrupted this interaction. In cells, filamins tethered plasma membrane CFTR to the underlying actin network. This interaction stabilized CFTR at the cell surface and regulated the plasma membrane dynamics and confinement of the channel. In the absence of filamin binding, CFTR was internalized from the cell surface, where it prematurely accumulated in lysosomes and was ultimately degraded. Our data demonstrate what we believe to be a previously unrecognized role for the CFTR N terminus in the regulation of the plasma membrane stability and metabolic stability of CFTR. In addition, we elucidate the molecular defect associated with the S13F mutation.},

Studies concerning the function of the lipid metabolism of the airway epithelium are so far based only on the detection of lipids by immunohistochemistry but quantitative analyses have not been performed. Although recent advances in mass spectrometry have allowed to identify a variety of lipid classes simultaneously in isolated tissue samples, up until now, these methods were not suitable to analyze lipids in the airway epithelium. To determine all major lipid classes in airway epithelial cells, we used an LC–MS-based approach that can easily be combined with the specific isolation procedure to obtain epithelial cells. We tested the suitability of this method with a mouse model of experimental asthma. In response to allergen challenge, perturbations in the sphingolipids were detected, which led to increased levels of ceramides. We expanded the scope of this approach analysing human bronchus samples without pathological findings of adenocarcinoma patients. For the human lung epithelium an unusual lipid class distribution was found in which ceramide was the predominant sphingolipid. In summary, we show that disease progression and lipid metabolism perturbation can be monitored in animal models and that the method can be used for the analysis of clinical samples.},

Three cholinesterase inhibitors (CIs) are currently available and have been approved for the treatment of mild to moderate AD. A further therapeutic option available for moderate to severe AD is memantine, an N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor noncompetitive antagonist. Treatments capable of stopping or at least effectively modifying the course of AD, referred to as ‘disease-modifying' drugs, are still under extensive research. To block the progression of the disease they have to interfere with the pathogenic steps responsible for the clinical symptoms, including the deposition of extracellular amyloid $\beta$ plaques and intracellular neurofibrillary tangle formation, inflammation, oxidative damage, iron deregulation and cholesterol metabolism.

Yet, the reliability of these calculations can often be improved significantly if a number of precepts, or good practices, are followed. Although the theory upon which these good practices rely has largely been known for many years, it is often overlooked or simply ignored. In other cases, the theoretical developments are too recent for their potential to be fully grasped and merged into popular platforms for the computation of free-energy differences. In this contribution, the current best practices for carrying out free-energy calculations using free energy perturbation and nonequilibrium work methods are discussed, demonstrating that at little to no additional cost, free-energy estimates could be markedly improved and bounded by meaningful error estimates. Monitoring the probability distributions that underlie the transformation between the states of interest, performing the calculation bidirectionally, stratifying the reaction pathway, and choosing the most appropriate paradigms and algorithms for transforming between states offer significant gains in both accuracy and precision. {\textcopyright} 2010 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {The major cystic fibrosis causing mutation, F508del-CFTR (where CFTR is cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator), impairs biosynthetic maturation of the CFTR protein, limiting its expression as a phosphorylation-dependent channel on the cell surface. The maturation defect can be partially rescued by low-temperature (27°C) cell culture conditions or small-molecule corrector compounds. Following its partial rescue, the open probability of F508del-CFTR is enhanced by the potentiator compound, VX-770. However, the channel activity of rescued F508del-CFTR remains less than that of the Wt-CFTR protein in the presence of VX-770. In this study, we asked if there are allosteric effects of F508del on the phosphorylation-regulated R domain. To identify defects in the R domain, we compared the phosphorylation status at protein kinase A sites in the R domain of Wt and F508del-CFTR. Here we show that phosphorylation of Ser-660, quantified by SRM-MS, is reduced in F508del-CFTR. Although the generation of a phosphomimic at this site (substituting aspartic acid for serine) did not modify the maturation defect, it did enhance F508del-CFTR channel function after pharmacological rescue with corrector VX-809, and treatment with the potentiator, VX-770. These findings support the concept that defective phosphorylation of F508del-CFTR partially accounts for its altered channel activity at the cell surface.},

abstract = {Protein structures in the Protein Data Bank provide a wealth of data about the interactions that determine the native states of proteins. Using the probability theory, we derive an atomic distance-dependent statistical potential from a sample of native structures that does not depend on any adjustable parameters (Discrete Optimized Protein Energy, or DOPE). DOPE is based on an improved reference state that corresponds to noninteracting atoms in a homogeneous sphere with the radius dependent on a sample native structure; it thus accounts for the finite and spherical shape of the native structures. The DOPE potential was extracted from a nonredundant set of 1472 crystallographic structures. We tested DOPE and five other scoring functions by the detection of the native state among six multiple target decoy sets, the correlation between the score and model error, and the identification of the most accurate non-native structure in the decoy set. For all decoy sets, DOPE is the best performing function in terms of all criteria, except for a tie in one criterion for one decoy set. To facilitate its use in various applications, such as model assessment, loop modeling, and fitting into cryo-electron microscopy mass density maps combined with comparative protein structure modeling, DOPE was incorporated into the modeling package MODELLER-8.},

abstract = {Herein, we present a novel Hamiltonian replica exchange protocol for classical molecular dynamics simulations of protein folding/unfolding. The scheme starts from the analysis of the energy-networks responsible for the stabilization of the folded conformation, by means of the energy-decomposition approach. In this framework, the compact energetic map of the native state is generated by a preliminary short molecular dynamics (MD) simulation of the protein in explicit solvent. This map is simplified by means of an eigenvalue decomposition. The highest components of the eigenvector associated with the lowest eigenvalue indicate which sites, named "hot spots", are likely to be responsible for the stability and correct folding of the protein. In the Hamiltonian replica exchange protocol, we use modified force-field parameters to treat the interparticle non-bonded potentials of the hot spots within the protein and between protein and solvent atoms, leaving unperturbed those relative to all other residues, as well as solvent-solvent interactions. We show that it is possible to reversibly simulate the folding/unfolding behavior of two test proteins, namely Villin HeadPiece HP35 (35 residues) and Protein A (62 residues), using a limited number of replicas. We next discuss possible implications for the study of folding mechanisms via all atom simulations. {\textcopyright} 2013 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract = {Small-angle X-ray and small-angle neutron scattering (SAXS/SANS) provide unique structural information on biomolecules and their complexes in solution. SANS may provide multiple independent data sets by means of contrast variation experiments, that is, by measuring at different D2O concentrations and different perdeuteration conditions of the biomolecular complex. However, even the combined data from multiple SAXS/SANS sets is by far insufficient to define all degrees of freedom of a complex, leading to a significant risk of overfitting when refining biomolecular structures against SAXS/SANS data. Hence, to control against overfitting, the low-information SAXS/SANS data must be complemented by accurate physical models, and, if possible, refined models should be cross-validated against independent data not used during the refinement. We present a method for refining atomic biomolecular structures against multiple sets of SAXS and SANS data using all-atom molecular dynamics simulations. Using the protein citrate synthase and the protein/RNA complex Sxl-Unr-msl2 mRNA as test cases, we demonstrate how multiple SAXS and SANS sets may be used for refinement and cross-validation, thereby excluding overfitting during refinement. For the Sxl-Unr-msl2 complex, we find that perdeuteration of the Unr domain leads to a unique, slightly compacted conformation, whereas other perdeuteration conditions lead to similar solution conformations compared to the nondeuterated state. In line with our previous method for predicting SAXS curves, SANS curves were predicted with explicit-solvent calculations, taking atomic models for both the hydration layer and the excluded solvent into account, thereby avoiding the use of solvent-related fitting parameters and solvent-reduced neutron scattering lengths. We expect the method to be useful for deriving and validating solution structures of biomolecules and soft-matter complexes, and for critically assessing whether multiple SAXS and SANS sets are mutually compatible.},

abstract = {A molecular basis is presented for characterizing the osmotic second virial coefficient, B22, of dilute protein solutions, which provides a measure of the nature of protein-protein interactions and has been shown to be correlated with crystallization behavior. Experimental measurements of the second virial coefficient of lysozyme and bovine $\alpha$-chymotrypsinogen A were performed by static light scattering, as a function of pH and electrolyte concentration. Although some of the trends can be explained qualitatively by simple colloidal models of protein interactions, a more realistic interpretation based on protein crystallographic structures suggests a different explanation of experimental trends. The interactions accounted for are solute-solute excluded volume (steric), electrostatic and short-range (mainly van der Waals) interactions. The interactions depend strongly on orientation, and this profoundly affects calculated second virial coefficients. We find that molecular configurations in which complementary surfaces are apposed contribute disproportionately to the second virial coefficient, mainly through short-range interactions; electrostatic interactions play a secondary role in many of these configurations. Thus molecular recognition events can play a role in determining the solution thermodynamic properties of proteins, and this provides a plausible basis for explaining the observed relationship with crystallization behavior. {\textcopyright} 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {While Langevin integrators are popular in the study of equilibrium properties of complex systems, it is challenging to estimate the timestep-induced discretization error: the degree to which the sampled phase-space or configuration-space probability density departs from the desired target density due to the use of a finite integration timestep. In [[1][1]], Sivak et al . introduced a convenient approach to approximating a natural measure of error between the sampled density and the target equilibrium density, the KL divergence, in phase space , but did not specifically address the issue of configuration-space properties , which are much more commonly of interest in molecular simulations. Here, we introduce a variant of this near-equilibrium estimator capable of measuring the error in the configuration-space marginal density, validating it against a complex but exact nested Monte Carlo estimator to show that it reproduces the KL divergence with high fidelity. To illustrate its utility, we employ this new near-equilibrium estimator to assess a claim that a recently proposed Langevin integrator introduces extremely small configuration-space density errors up to the stability limit at no extra computational expense. Finally, we show how this approach to quantifying sampling bias can be applied to a wide variety of stochastic integrators by following a straightforward procedure to compute the appropriate shadow work, and describe how it can be extended to quantify the error in arbitrary marginal or conditional distributions of interest.

The present work explores the predictions of this model for basic thermodynamic properties of electrolyte solutions, namely, the density, isothermal compressibility, and surface tension.

abstract = {Aim: The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of fluid injection viscosity in combination with different injection volumes and flow rates on subcutaneous (SC) injection pain tolerance. Methods: The study was a single-center, comparative, randomized, crossover, Phase I study in 24 healthy adults. Each participant received six injections in the abdomen area of either a 2 or 3 mL placebo solution, with three different fluid viscosities (1, 8–10, and 15–20 cP) combined with two different injection flow rates (0.02 and 0.3 mL/s). All injections were performed with 50 mL syringes and 27G, 6 mm needles. Perceived injection pain was assessed using a 100 mm visual analog scale (VAS) (0 mm/no pain, 100 mm/extreme pain). The location and depth of the injected fluid was assessed through 2D ultrasound echography images. Results: Viscosity levels had significant impact on perceived injection pain (P=0.0003). Specifically, less pain was associated with high viscosity (VAS =12.6 mm) than medium (VAS =16.6 mm) or low (VAS =22.1 mm) viscosities, with a significant difference between high and low viscosities (P=0.0002). Target injection volume of 2 or 3 mL was demonstrated to have no significant impact on perceived injection pain (P=0.89). Slow (0.02 mL/s) or fast (0.30 mL/s) injection rates also showed no significant impact on perceived pain during SC injection (P=0.79). In 92{\%} of injections, the injected fluid was located exclusively in SC tissue whereas the remaining injected fluids were found located in SC and/or intradermal layers. Conclusion: The results of this study suggest that solutions of up to 3 mL and up to 15–20 cP injected into the abdomen within 10 seconds are well tolerated without pain. High viscosity injections were shown to be the most tolerated, whereas injection volume and flow rates did not impact perceived pain.},

abstract = {CFTR is unique among ABC transporters as the only one functioning as an ion channel and from a human health perspective because mutations in its gene cause cystic fibrosis. Although considerable advances have been made towards understanding CFTR's mechanism of action and the impact of mutations, the lack of a high-resolution 3D structure has hindered progress. The large multi-domain membrane glycoprotein is normally present at low copy number and when over expressed at high levels it aggregates strongly, limiting the production of stable mono-disperse preparations. While the reasons for the strong self-association are not fully understood, its relatively low thermal stability seems likely to be one. The major CF causing mutation, $\Delta$F508, renders the protein very thermally unstable and therefore a great deal of attention has been paid to this property of CFTR. Multiple second site mutations of CFTR in NBD1 where F508 normally resides and small molecule binders of the domain increase the thermal stability of the mutant. These manipulations also stabilize the wild-type protein. Here we have applied $\Delta$F508-stabilizing changes and other modifications to generate wild-type constructs that express at much higher levels in scaled-up suspension cultures of mammalian cells. After purification and reconstitution into liposomes these proteins are active in a locked-open conformation at temperatures as high as 50°C and remain monodisperse at 4°C in detergent or lipid for at least a week. The availability of adequate amounts of these and related stable active preparations of homogeneous CFTR will enable stalled structural and ligand binding studies to proceed.},

abstract = {Mutations of the chloride channel cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) that impair its apical localization and function cause cystic fibrosis. A previous report has shown that filamin A (FLNa), an actin-cross-linking and -scaffolding protein, interacts directly with the cytoplasmic N terminus of CFTR and that this interaction is necessary for stability and confinement of the channel to apical membranes. Here, we report that the CFTR N terminus has sequence similarity to known FLNa-binding partner-binding sites. FLNa has 24 Ig (IgFLNa) repeats, and a CFTR peptide pulled down repeats 9, 12, 17, 19, 21, and 23, which share sequence similarity yet differ from the other FLNa Ig domains. Using known structures of IgFLNa{\textperiodcentered}partner complexes as templates, we generated in silico models of IgFLNa{\textperiodcentered}CFTR peptide complexes. Point and deletion mutants of IgFLNa and CFTR informed by the models, including disease-causing mutations L15P and W19C, disrupted the binding interaction. The model predicted that a P5L CFTR mutation should not affect binding, but a synthetic P5L mutant peptide had reduced solubility, suggesting a different disease-causing mechanism. Taken together with the fact that FLNa dimers are elongated (̃160 nm) strands, whereas CFTR is compact (6-8 nm), we propose that a single FLNa molecule can scaffold multiple CFTR partners. Unlike previously defined dimeric FLNa{\textperiodcentered}partner complexes, the FLNa-monomeric CFTR interaction is relatively weak, presumptively facilitating dynamic clustering of CFTR at cell membranes. Finally, we show that deletion of all CFTR interacting domains from FLNa suppresses the surface expression of CFTR on baby hamster kidney cells.},

abstract = {Deep eutectic solvents (DESs) are utilized as green and inexpensive alternatives to classical ionic liquids. It has been known that some of DESs can be used as solvent in the enzymatic reactions to obtain very green chemical processes. DESs are quite poorly understood at the molecular level. Moreover, we do not know much about the enzyme microstructure in such systems. For example, how some hydrolase can remain active and stable in a deep eutectic solvent including 9 M of urea? In this study, the molecular dynamics of DESs as a liquid was simulated at the molecular level. Urea:choline chloride as a well-known eutectic mixture was chosen as a model DES. The behavior of the lipase as a biocatalyst was studied in this system. For comparison, the enzyme structure was also simulated in 8M urea. The thermal stability of the enzyme was also evaluated in DESs, water, and 8M urea. The enzyme showed very good conformational stability in the urea:choline chloride mixture with about 66{\%} urea (9 M) even at high temperatures. The results are in good agreement with recent experimental observations. In contrast, complete enzyme denaturation occurred in 8M urea with only 12{\%} urea in water. It was found that urea molecules denature the enzyme by interrupting the intra-chain hydrogen bonds in a "direct denaturation mechanism". However, in a urea:choline chloride deep eutectic solvent, as a result of hydrogen bonding with choline and chloride ions, urea molecules have a low diffusion coefficient and cannot reach the protein domains. Interestingly, urea, choline, and chloride ions form hydrogen bonds with the surface residues of the enzyme which, instead of lipase denaturation, leads to greater enzyme stability. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study in which the microstructural properties of a macromolecule are examined in a deep eutectic solvent. {\textcopyright} the Partner Organisations 2014.},

This work reports a Density Functional Theory study combined with a topological analysis of the electronic density for deep eutectic solvents to rationalize melting temperature at the molecular level. The reported results show a direct relationship between the melting temperature and the hydrogen bond network features. The proposed methodology shows the feasibility of tailoring macroscopic properties of deep eutectic solvents through the molecular structure of involved compounds.},

abstract = {Mutations in the chloride channel cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR) cause cystic fibrosis, a genetic disorder characterized by defects in CFTR biosynthesis, localization to the cell surface, or activation by regulatory factors. It was discovered recently that surface localization of CFTR is stabilized by an interaction between the CFTR N terminus and the multidomain cytoskeletal protein filamin. The details of the CFTR-filamin interaction, however, are unclear. Using x-ray crystallography, we show how the CFTR N terminus binds to immunoglobulin-like repeat 21 of filamin A (FlnA-Ig21). CFTR binds to $\beta$-strands C and D of FlnA-Ig21 using backbone-backbone hydrogen bonds, a linchpin serine residue, and hydrophobic side-chain packing. We use NMR to determine that the CFTR N terminus also binds to several other immunoglobulin-like repeats from filamin A in vitro. Our structural data explain why the cystic fibrosis-causing S13F mutation disrupts CFTR-filamin interaction. We show that FlnA-Ig repeats transfected into cultured Calu-3 cells disrupt CFTR-filamin interaction and reduce surface levels of CFTR. Our findings suggest that filamin A stabilizes surface CFTR by anchoring it to the actin cytoskeleton through interactions with multiple filamin Ig repeats. Such an interaction mode may allow filamins to cluster multiple CFTR molecules and to promote colocalization of CFTR and other filamin-binding proteins in the apical plasma membrane of epithelial cells.},

abstract = {Abstract The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is a plasma-membrane anion channel that, when mutated, causes the disease cystic fibrosis. Although CFTR has been detected in a detergent-resistant membrane fraction prepared from airway epithelial cells, suggesting that it may partition into cholesterol-rich membrane microdomains (lipid rafts), its compartmentalization has not been demonstrated in intact cells and the influence of microdomains on CFTR lateral mobility is unknown. We used live-cell imaging, spatial image correlation spectroscopy, and k-space image correlation spectroscopy to examine the aggregation state of CFTR and its dynamics both within and outside microdomains in the plasma membrane of primary human bronchial epithelial cells. These studies were also performed during treatments that augment or deplete membrane cholesterol. We found two populations of CFTR molecules that were distinguishable based on their dynamics at the cell surface. One population showed confinement and had slow dynamics that were highly cholesterol dependent. The other, more abundant population was less confined and diffused more rapidly. Treatments that deplete the membrane of cholesterol caused the confined fraction and average number of CFTR molecules per cluster to decrease. Elevating cholesterol had the opposite effect, increasing channel aggregation and the fraction of channels displaying confinement, consistent with CFTR recruitment into cholesterol-rich microdomains with dimensions below the optical resolution limit. Viral infection caused the nanoscale microdomains to fuse into large platforms and reduced CFTR mobility. To our knowledge, these results provide the first biophysical evidence for multiple CFTR populations and have implications for regulation of their surface expression and channel function.},

Thus, a new point of view to solvation phenomena is presented, which provides an alternative access to many questions of scientific and technical importance. The whole theory is based on the results of molecular orbital continuum solvation models.

abstract = {This paper uses the binding pocket of human carbonic anhydrase II (HCAII, EC 4.2.1.1) as a tool to examine the properties of Hofmeister anions that determine (i) where, and how strongly, they associate with concavities on the surfaces of proteins and (ii) how, upon binding, they alter the structure of water within those concavities. Results from X-ray crystallography and isothermal titration calorimetry show that most anions associate with the binding pocket of HCAII by forming inner-sphere ion pairs with the Zn2+ cofactor. In these ion pairs, the free energy of anion-Zn2+ association is inversely proportional to the free energetic cost of anion dehydration; this relationship is consistent with the mechanism of ion pair formation suggested by the "law of matching water affinities". Iodide and bromide anions also associate with a hydrophobic declivity in the wall of the binding pocket. Molecular dynamics simulations suggest that anions, upon associating with Zn2+, trigger rearrangements of water that extend up to 8 {\AA} away from their surfaces. These findings expand the range of interactions previously thought to occur between ions and proteins by suggesting that (i) weakly hydrated anions can bind complementarily shaped hydrophobic declivities, and that (ii) ion-induced rearrangements of water within protein concavities can (in contrast with similar rearrangements in bulk water) extend well beyond the first hydration shells of the ions that trigger them. This study paints a picture of Hofmeister anions as a set of structurally varied ligands that differ in size, shape, and affinity for water and, thus, in their ability to bind to - and to alter the charge and hydration structure of - polar, nonpolar, and topographically complex concavities on the surfaces of proteins.},

Polarized epithelial cells have morphologically and functionally distinct apical and basolateral surfaces separated by tight junctions. The establishment and maintenance of these structures require delivery of membrane proteins and lipids to these domains. In this work, we have isolated a cDNA clone from a human intestinal cDNA library encoding a small GTPase, rab13, closely related to the yeast Sec4 protein. Confocal microscopy analysis on polarized Caco-2 cells shows that rab13 protein colocalized with the tight junction marker ZO-1. Cryostat sections of tissues confirm that rab13 localized to the junctional complex region of a variety of epithelia, including intestine, kidney, liver, and of endothelial cells. This localization requires assembly and integrity of the tight junctions. Disruption of tight junctions by incubation in low Ca2+ media induces the redistribution of rab13. In cells devoid of tight junctions, rab13 was found associated with vesicles dispersed throughout the cytoplasm. Cell-cell contacts initiated by E-cadherin in transfected L cells do not recruit rab13 to the resulting adherens-like junction complexes. The participation of rab13 in polarized transport, in the assembly and/or the activity of tight junctions is discussed.},

The aim of this in vitro study was to evaluate the effect of ivacaftor on mutant CFTR protein forms with defects in protein processing and/or channel function. Methods The effect of ivacaftor on CFTR function was tested in electrophysiological studies using a panel of Fischer rat thyroid (FRT) cells expressing 54 missense CFTR mutations that cause defects in the amount or function of CFTR at the cell surface. Results Ivacaftor potentiated multiple mutant CFTR protein forms that produce functional CFTR at the cell surface. These included mutant CFTR forms with mild defects in CFTR processing or mild defects in CFTR channel conductance. Conclusions These in vitro data indicated that ivacaftor is a broad acting CFTR potentiator and could be used to help stratify patients with CF who have different CFTR genotypes for studies investigating the potential clinical benefit of ivacaftor.},

abstract = {Deep eutectic solvents (DESs) have shown tremendous promise as green solvents with low toxicity and cost. Understanding molecular aggregation processes within DESs will not only enhance the application potential of these solvents but also help alleviate some of the limitations associated with them. Among DESs, those comprising choline chloride and appropriate hydrogen-bond donors are inexpensive and easy to prepare. On the basis of fluorescence probe, electrical conductivity, and surface tension experiments, we present the first clear lines of evidence for self-aggregation of an anionic surfactant within a DES containing a small fraction of water. Namely, well-defined assemblies of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) apparently form in the archetype DES Reline comprising a 1:2 molar mixture of choline chloride and urea. Significant enhancement in the solubility of organic solvents that are otherwise not miscible in choline chloride-based DESs is achieved within Reline in the presence of SDS. The remarkably improved solubility of cyclohexane within SDS-added Reline is attributed to the presence of spontaneously formed cyclohexane-in-Reline microemulsions by SDS under ambient conditions. Surface tension, dynamic light scattering (DLS), small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), density, and dynamic viscosity measurements along with responses from the fluorescence dipolarity and microfluidity probes of pyrene and 1,3-bis(1-pyrenyl)propane are employed to characterize these aggregates. Such water-free oil-in-DES microemulsions are appropriately sized to be considered as a new type of nanoreactor.},

abstract = {We simulated the structure of reversible protein aggregates as a function of protein surface characteristics, protein-protein interaction energies, and the entropic penalty accompanying the immobilization of protein in a solid phase. These simulations represent an extension of our previous work on kinetically irreversible protein aggregate structure and are based on an explicit accounting of the specific protein-protein interactions that occur within reversible aggregates and crystals. We considered protein monomers with a mixture of hydrophobic and hydrophilic surface regions suspended in a polar solvent; the energetic driving force for aggregation is provided by the burial of solvent-exposed hydrophobic surface area. We analyzed the physical properties of the generated aggregates, including density, protein-protein contact distributions, solvent accessible surface area, porosity, and order, and compared our results with the protein crystallization literature as well as with the kinetically irreversible case. The physical properties of reversible aggregates were consonant with those observed for the irreversible aggregates, although in general, reversible aggregates were more stable energetically and were more crystal-like in their order content than their irreversible counterparts. The reversible aggregates were less dense than the irreversible aggregates, indicating that the increased energetic stability is derived primarily from the optimality rather than the density of the packing in the solid phase. The extent of hydrophobic protein-protein contacts and solvent-exposed surface area within the aggregate phase depended on the aggregation pathway: reversible aggregates tended to have a greater proportion of hydrophobic-hydrophobic contacts and a smaller fraction of hydrophobic solvent-exposed surface area. Furthermore, the arrangement of hydrophobic patches on the protein surface played a major role in the distribution of protein contacts and solvent content. This was readily reflected in the order of the aggregates: the greater the contiguity of the hydrophobic patches on the monomer surface, the less ordered the aggregates became, despite the opportunities for rearrangement offered by a reversible pathway. These simulations have enhanced our understanding of the impact of protein structural motifs on aggregate properties and on the demarcation between aggregation and crystallization.},

VX-770 potentiated wildtype CFTR and several disease mutants expressed in oocytes in a manner modulated by PKA-mediated phosphorylation. Potentiation of some other mutants, including G551D-CFTR, was less dependent upon the level of phosphorylation, likely related to the severe gating defects in these mutants exhibited in part by a shift in PKA sensitivity to activation, possibly due to an electrostatic interaction of D551 with K1250. Phosphorylation-dependent potentiation of wildtype CFTR and other variants also was observed in epithelial cells. Hence, the efficacy of potentiators may be obscured by a ceiling effect when drug screening is performed under strongly phosphorylating conditions.

The experimental data for each binodal curve have been correlated using three empirical models based on exponential and polynomial equations. The tie-line data were suitably described by applying the Othmer-Tobias and Bancroft models. The data obtained demonstrated the great ability of N1112OHDHP to act as phase promoter in aqueous solutions of non-ionic surfactants in comparison with other ionic liquids like N1112OHCl, N1112OHDHC or C2C1imC2SO4.},

abstract = {Atomistic description of protein fibril formation has been elusive due to the complexity and long time scales of the conformational search. Here, we develop a multiscale approach combining numerous atomistic simulations in explicit solvent to construct Markov State Models (MSMs) of fibril growth. The search for the in-register fully bound fibril state is modeled as a random walk on a rugged two-dimensional energy landscape defined by $\beta$-sheet alignment and hydrogen-bonding states, whereas transitions involving states without hydrogen bonds are derived from kinetic clustering. The reversible association/dissociation of an incoming peptide and overall growth kinetics are then computed from MSM simulations. This approach is applied to derive a parameter-free, comprehensive description of fibril elongation of A$\beta$16–22 and how it is modulated by phenylalanine-to-cyclohexylalanine (CHA) mutations. The trajectories show an aggregation mechanism in which the peptide spends most of its time trapped in misregistered $\beta$-sheet states connected by weakly bound states twith short lifetimes. Our results recapitulate the experimental observation that mutants CHA19 and CHA1920 accelerate fibril elongation but have a relatively minor effect on the critical concentration for fibril growth. Importantly, the kinetic consequences of mutations arise from cumulative effects of perturbing the network of productive and nonproductive pathways of fibril growth. This is consistent with the expectation that nonfunctional states will not have evolved efficient folding pathways and, therefore, will require a random search of configuration space. This study highlights the importance of describing the complete energy landscape when studying the elongation mechanism and kinetics of protein fibrils.},

Proteinopathy caused by cellular stresses such as endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, oxidative stress, mitochondrial stress and proteasomal stress and the formation of stress granules (SGs), cytoplasmic aggregates and inclusions is a hallmark of ALS. FUS and TDP-43, which are DNA/RNA binding proteins that regulate transcription, RNA homeostasis and protein translation are implicated in ALS proteinopathy. Disease-causing mutations in FUS and TDP-43 cause sequestration of these proteins and their interacting partners in the cytoplasm, which leads to aggregation. This mislocalization and formation of aggregates and SGs is cytotoxic and a contributor to neuronal death. We explore how loss-of-nuclear-function and gain-of-cytoplasmic function mechanisms that affect FUS and TPD-43 localization can generate a ‘stressed out' neuronal pathology and proteinopathy that drives ALS progression.},

Oxidation of key regulatory kinases, including Akt, mTOR and AMPK influences the fidelity rather than their absolute activation state, highlighting an unappreciated interplay between these modifications. Mechanistic analysis of the redox regulation of Akt identified two cysteine residues in the pleckstrin homology domain (C60 and C77) to be reversibly oxidized. Oxidation at these sites affected Akt recruitment to the plasma membrane by stabilizing the PIP3 binding pocket. Our data provide insights into the interplay between oxidative stress-derived redox signalling and protein phosphorylation networks and serve as a resource for understanding the contribution of cellular oxidation to a range of diseases.},

abstract = {The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) belongs to the ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporter superfamily but functions as an anion channel crucial for salt and water transport across epithelial cells. CFTR dysfunction, because of mutations, causes cystic fibrosis (CF). The anionselective pore of the CFTR protein is formed by its two transmembrane domains (TMDs) and regulated by its cytosolic domains: two nucleotide binding domains (NBDs) and a regulatory (R) domain. Channel activation requires phosphorylation of the R domain by cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA), and pore opening and closing (gating) of phosphorylated channels is driven by ATP binding and hydrolysis at the NBDs. This review summarizes available information on structure and mechanism of the CFTR protein, with a particular focus on atomic-level insight gained from recent cryo-electron microscopic structures and on the molecular mechanisms of channel gating and its regulation. The pharmacological mechanisms of small molecules targeting CFTR's ion channel function, aimed at treating patients suffering from CF and other diseases, are briefly discussed.},

Recently obtained ATP-free and ATP-bound structures of zebrafish CFTR revealed an unwound segment of transmembrane helix (TM) 8, which appears to be a unique feature of CFTR not present in other ATP-binding cassette transporter structures. Here, using $\mu$s-long molecular dynamics simulations, we investigate the interactions formed by this TM8 segment with nearby helices in both ATP-free and ATP-bound states. We highlight ATP-dependent interactions as well as the structural role of TM8 in maintaining the functional architecture of the pore via interactions common to both the ATP-bound and ATP-free state.

abstract = {Intrinsically disordered proteins play crucial roles in regulatory processes and often function as protein interaction hubs. Here, we present a detailed characterization of a full-length disordered hub protein region involved in multiple dynamic complexes. We performed NMR, CD, and fluorescence binding studies on the nonphosphorylated and highly PKA-phosphorylated human cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) regulatory region, a ∼200-residue disordered segment involved in phosphorylation- dependent regulation of channel trafficking and gating. Our data provide evidence for dynamic, phosphorylation-dependent, multisite interactions of various segments of the regulatory region for its intra- and intermolecular partners, including the CFTR nucleotide binding domains 1 and 2, a 42-residue peptide from the C terminus of CFTR, the SLC26A3 sulphate transporter and antisigma factor antagonist (STAS) domain, and 14-3-3$\beta$. Because of its large number of binding partners, multivalent binding of individually weak sites facilitates rapid exchange between free and bound states to allow the regulatory region to engage with different partners and generate a graded or rheostat-like response to phosphorylation. Our results enrich the understanding of how disordered binding segments interact with multiple targets. We present structural models consistent with our data that illustrate this dynamic aspect of phospho-regulation of CFTR by the disordered regulatory region.},

abstract = {Two views about mathematics: nominalism and platonism In ontological discussions about mathematics, two views are prominent. According to platonism, mathematical objects (as well as mathematical relations and structures) exist and are abstract; that is, they are not located in space and time and have no causal connection with us. Although this characterization of abstract objects is purely negative—indicating what such objects are not—in the context of mathematics it captures the crucial features the objects in questions are supposed to have. According to nominalism, mathematical objects (including, henceforth, mathematical relations and structures) do not exist, or at least they need not be taken to exist for us to make sense of mathematics. So, it is the nominalist's burden to show how to interpret mathematics without the commitment to the existence of mathematical objects. This is, in fact, a key feature of nominalism: those who defend the view need to show that it is possible to yield at least as much explanatory work as the platonist obtains, but invoking a meager ontology. To achieve that, nominalists in the philosophy of mathematics forge interconnections with metaphysics (whether mathematical objects do exist), epistemology (what kind of knowledge of these entities we have), and philosophy of science (how to make sense of the successful application of mathematics in science without being committed to the existence of mathematical entities). These interconnections are one of the sources of the variety of nominalist views.},

However, detailed structure-function analyses have only been established for a few of them. This study aimed evaluating the impact of eight N-terminus CFTR natural missense changes on channel behavior. By site-directed mutagenesis, we generated four CFTR variants in the N-terminal cytoplasmic tail (p.P5L, p.S50P, p.E60K, and p.R75Q) and four in the first transmembrane segment of membrane-spanning domain 1 (p.G85E/V, p.Y89C, and p.E92K). Immunoblot analysis revealed that p.S50P, p.E60K, p.G85E/V, and p.E92K produced only core-glycosylated proteins. Immunofluorescence and whole cell patch-clamp confirmed intracellular retention, thus reflecting a defect of CFTR folding and/or trafficking. In contrast, both p.R75Q and p.Y89C had a glycosylation pattern and a subcellular distribution comparable to the wild-type CFTR, while the percentage of mature p.P5L was considerably reduced, suggesting a major biogenesis flaw on this channel. Nevertheless, whole-cell chloride currents were recorded for all three variants. Single-channel patch-clamp analyses revealed that the channel activity of p.R75Q appeared similar to that of the wild-type CFTR, while both p.P5L and p.Y89C channels displayed abnormal gating. Overall, our results predict a major impact of the CFTR missense variants analyzed, except p.R75Q, on the CF phenotype and highlight the importance of the CFTR N-terminus on channel physiology. {\textcopyright} 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Previously we have studied the energetics of dissociation in a potassium channel-charybdotoxin complex by using umbrella sampling molecular-dynamics simulations, and established the need for carefully chosen coordinates and restraints to maintain the physiological ligand conformation. Here we address the ligand integrity problem further by constructing additional potential of mean forces for dissociation of charybdotoxin using restraints. We show that the large discrepancies in binding free energy arising from simulation artifacts can be avoided by using appropriate restraints on the ligand, which enables determination of the binding free energy within the chemical accuracy. We make several suggestions for optimal choices of harmonic potential parameters and restraints to be used in binding studies of large ligands. {\textcopyright} 2011 by the Biophysical Society.},

abstract = {Conformational change in polymers including proteins is central to many molecular processes. Defining conformational states, however, remains a difficult and increasingly common problem, with many existing methods based on arbitrary or potentially unrepresentative measures. Furthermore, the expanding length of molecular dynamics simulations and direct observation of transitions between different energy basins suggest that this issue will only become evermore important. Methods commonly used to characterize conformational states include principal component analysis, root-mean-square deviation-based clustering, and geometric measurements such as hinge angles and distances. Here we present a method where the eigenvector frequencies derived from a Gaussian network model (Bahar, I.; Atilgan, A. R.; Erman, B. Folding Des. 1997, 2, 173-181) of a trajectory of structures from a molecular dynamics simulation are used to describe the state of the protein at each time point. We apply the method to three proteins that share the same fold as the type II periplasmic binding proteins: The lysine-arginine-ornithine-binding protein, the glutamine-binding protein, and the ligand-binding domain from the NR1 N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor. We find that the method can distinguish different states in good agreement with a variety of previous analyses and additionally provides information on the dynamic properties of that system at a given time point. {\textcopyright} 2007 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {Plasma membranes (PMs) contain hundreds of different lipid species that contribute differently to overall bilayer properties. By modulation of these properties, membrane protein function can be affected. Furthermore, inhomogeneous lipid mixing and domains of lipid enrichment/depletion can sort proteins and provide optimal local environments. Recent coarse-grained (CG) Martini molecular dynamics efforts have provided glimpses into lipid organization of different PMs: an "Average"and a "Brain"PM. Their high complexity and large size require long simulations (∼80 $\mu$s) for proper sampling. Thus, these simulations are computationally taxing. This level of complexity is beyond the possibilities of all-atom simulations, raising the question - what complexity is needed for "realistic"bilayer properties? We constructed CG Martini PM models of varying complexity (63 down to 8 different lipids). Lipid tail saturations and headgroup combinations were kept as consistent as possible for the "tissues'"(Average/Brain) at three levels of compositional complexity. For each system, we analyzed membrane properties to evaluate which features can be retained at lower complexity and validate eight-component bilayers that can act as reliable mimetics for Average or Brain PMs. Systems of reduced complexity deliver a more robust and malleable tool for computational membrane studies and allow for equivalent all-atom simulations and experiments.},

As an anode for lithium ion batteries, cyclic voltammetry curves, electrochemical impedance spectra, and cyclability of the novel structured Ni-P nanoparticles were evaluated.

abstract = {Solution pH affects numerous biological processes and some biological membranes are exposed to extreme pH environments. We utilized micropipette aspiration of giant unilamellar vesicles composed of 1-stearoyl-2-oleoyl- phosphatidylcholine to characterize the effect of solution pH (2-9) on membrane mechanical properties. The elastic area compressibility modulus was unaffected between pH 3 and 9 but was reduced by ∼30{\%} at pH 2. Fluorescence experiments utilizing the phase-sensitive probe Laurdan confirmed gel-phase characteristics at pH 2, explaining the reduction of membrane elasticity. The membrane bending stiffness, kc, increased by ∼40{\%} at pH 4 and pH 9 over the control value at pH 6.5. Electrophoretic mobility measurements indicate that these changes are qualitatively consistent with theoretical models that predict the effect of membrane surface charge density and Debye length on kc, substantiating a coupling between the mechanical and interfacial electrical properties of the membrane. The effect of pH on intramembrane electrical properties was examined by studying the spectral shifts of the potentiometric probe di-8 ANEPPS. The intramembrane (dipole) potential ($\psi$d) increased linearly as the solution pH decreased in a manner consistent with the partitioning of hydroxide ions into the membrane. However, changes in $\psi$d did not correlate with changes in kc. These mechanical and electrical studies lead to the conclusion that the effect of pH on membrane bending stiffness results from alterations in interfacial, as opposed to intramembrane, electrostatics. {\textcopyright} 2007 by the Biophysical Society.},

Here we present cryo-electron microscopy structures of CFTR in complex with two FDA-approved correctors: lumacaftor and tezacaftor. Both drugs insert into a hydrophobic pocket in the first transmembrane domain (TMD1), linking together four helices that are thermodynamically unstable. Mutating residues at the binding site rendered $\Delta$F508-CFTR insensitive to lumacaftor and tezacaftor, underscoring the functional significance of the structural discovery. These results support a mechanism in which the correctors stabilize TMD1 at an early stage of biogenesis, prevent its pre-mature degradation, and thereby allosterically rescue a large number of disease-causing mutations.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

abstract = {Peptide toxins have been valuable probes in efforts to identify amino acid residues that line the permeation pathway of cation-selective channels. However, no peptide toxins have been identified that interact with known anion-selective channels such as the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). CFTR channels are expressed in epithelial cells and are associated with several genetic disorders, including cystic fibrosis and polycystic kidney disease. Several organic inhibitors have been used to investigate the structure of the Cl- permeation pathway in CFTR. However, investigations of the wider cytoplasmic vestibule have been hindered by the lack of a high-affinity blocker that interacts with residues in this area. In this study we show that venom of the scorpion Leiurus quinquestriatus hebraeus reversibly inhibits CFTR, in a voltage-independent manner, by decreasing single-channel mean burst duration and open probability only when applied to the cytoplasmic surface of phosphorylated channels. Venom was able to decrease burst duration and open probability even when CFTR channels were locked open by treatment with either vanadate or adenosine 5′-($\beta$, $\gamma$-imido)-triphosphate, and block was strengthened on reduction of extracellular Cl- concentration, suggesting inhibition by a pore-block mechanism. Venom had no effect on ATP-dependent macroscopic opening rate in channels studied by inside-out macropatches. Interestingly, the inhibitory activity was abolished by proteinase treatment. We conclude that a peptide toxin contained in the scorpion venom inhibits CFTR channels by a pore-block mechanism; these experiments provide the first step toward isolation of the active component, which would be highly valuable as a probe for CFTR structure and function.},

abstract = {Atomic-level studies of protein activity represent a significant challenge as a result of the complexity of conformational changes occurring on wide-ranging timescales, often greatly exceeding that of even the longest simulations. A prime example is the elucidation of protein allosteric mechanisms, where localized perturbations transmit throughout a large macromolecule to generate a response signal. For example, the conversion of chemical to electrical signals during synaptic neurotransmission in the brain is achieved by specialized membrane proteins called pentameric ligand-gated ion channels. Here, the binding of a neurotransmitter results in a global conformational change to open an ion-conducting pore across the nerve cell membrane. X-ray crystallography has produced static structures of the open and closed states of the proton-gated GLIC pentameric ligand-gated ion channel protein, allowing for atomistic simulations that can uncover changes related to activation. We discuss a range of enhanced sampling approaches that could be used to explore activation mechanisms. In particular, we describe recent application of an atomistic string method, based on Roux's “swarms of trajectories” approach, to elucidate the sequence and interdependence of conformational changes during activation. We illustrate how this can be combined with transition analysis and Brownian dynamics to extract thermodynamic and kinetic information, leading to understanding of what controls ion channel function. {\textcopyright} 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract = {Most proteins assemble into multisubunit complexes1. The persistence of these complexes across evolutionary time is usually explained as the result of natural selection for functional properties that depend on multimerization, such as intersubunit allostery or the capacity to do mechanical work2. In many complexes, however, multimerization does not enable any known function3. An alternative explanation is that multimers could become entrenched if substitutions accumulate that are neutral in multimers but deleterious in monomers; purifying selection would then prevent reversion to the unassembled form, even if assembly per se does not enhance biological function3–7. Here we show that a hydrophobic mutational ratchet systematically entrenches molecular complexes. By applying ancestral protein reconstruction and biochemical assays to the evolution of steroid hormone receptors, we show that an ancient hydrophobic interface, conserved for hundreds of millions of years, is entrenched because exposure of this interface to solvent reduces protein stability and causes aggregation, even though the interface makes no detectable contribution to function. Using structural bioinformatics, we show that a universal mutational propensity drives sites that are buried in multimeric interfaces to accumulate hydrophobic substitutions to levels that are not tolerated in monomers. In a database of hundreds of families of multimers, most show signatures of long-term hydrophobic entrenchment. It is therefore likely that many protein complexes persist because a simple ratchet-like mechanism entrenches them across evolutionary time, even when they are functionally gratuitous.},

abstract = {Gaussian accelerated molecular dynamics (GaMD) is a recently developed enhanced sampling technique that provides efficient free energy calculations of biomolecules. Like the previous accelerated molecular dynamics (aMD), GaMD allows for "unconstrained" enhanced sampling without the need to set predefined collective variables and so is useful for studying complex biomolecular conformational changes such as protein folding and ligand binding. Furthermore, because the boost potential is constructed using a harmonic function that follows Gaussian distribution in GaMD, cumulant expansion to the second order can be applied to recover the original free energy profiles of proteins and other large biomolecules, which solves a long-standing energetic reweighting problem of the previous aMD method. Taken together, GaMD offers major advantages for both unconstrained enhanced sampling and free energy calculations of large biomolecules. Here, we have implemented GaMD in the NAMD package on top of the existing aMD feature and validated it on three model systems: alanine dipeptide, the chignolin fast-folding protein, and the M3 muscarinic G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR). For alanine dipeptide, while conventional molecular dynamics (cMD) simulations performed for 30 ns are poorly converged, GaMD simulations of the same length yield free energy profiles that agree quantitatively with those of 1000 ns cMD simulation. Further GaMD simulations have captured folding of the chignolin and binding of the acetylcholine (ACh) endogenous agonist to the M3 muscarinic receptor. The reweighted free energy profiles are used to characterize the protein folding and ligand binding pathways quantitatively. GaMD implemented in the scalable NAMD is widely applicable to enhanced sampling and free energy calculations of large biomolecules.},

The disease is likely due to a toxic gain of function caused by the misfolding, oligomerization, and eventual aggregation of mutant SOD1, but it is not yet understood how the structurally diverse mutations result in a common disease phenotype. The behavior of the apo-monomer fALS-associated mutant protein A4V was explored using molecular-dynamics simulations to elucidate characteristic structural changes to the protein that may allow the mutant form to improperly associate with other monomer subunits. Simulations showed that the mutant protein is less stable than the WT protein overall, with shifts in residue-residue contacts that lead to destabilization of the dimer and metal-binding sites, and stabilization of nonnative contacts that leads to a misfolded state. These findings provide a unifying explanation for disparate experimental observations, allow a better understanding of alterations of residue contacts that accompany loss of SOD1 structural integrity, and suggest sites where compensatory changes may stabilize the mutant structure. {\textcopyright} 2009 by the Biophysical Society.},

abstract = {The nature of the interaction between deep eutectic solvents (DESs), formed by ChCl and glycerol, and SO2 has been systematically investigated using the M06-2X density functional combined with cluster models. Block-localized wave function energy decomposition (BLW-ED) analysis shows that the interaction between SO2 and DESs is dominated by a charge transfer interaction. After this interaction, the SO2 molecule becomes negatively charged, whereas the ChCl-glycerol molecule is positively charged, which is the result of Lewis acid-base interaction. The current result affords a theoretical proof that it is highly useful and efficient to manipulate the Lewis acidity of absorbents for SO2 capture. Moreover, hydrogen bonding as well as electrostatic interactions may also contribute to the stability of the complex. Structure analysis shows that solvent molecules will adjust their geometries to interact with SO2. In addition, the structure of SO2 is barely changed after interaction. The interaction energy between different cluster models and SO2 ranges from -6.8 to -14.4 kcal mol-1. It is found that the interaction energy is very sensitive to the solvent structure. The moderate interaction between ChCl-glycerol and SO2 is consistent with the concept that highly efficient solvents for SO2 absorption should not only be solvable but also regenerable. 0},

abstract = {ConspectusDeep eutectic solvents (DESs) represent an alternative class of ionic fluids closely resembling room-temperature ionic liquids (RTILs), although, strictly speaking, they are distinguished by the fact that they also contain an organic molecular component (typically, a hydrogen bond donor like a urea, amide, acid, or polyol), frequently as the predominant constituent. Practically speaking, DESs are attractive alternatives to RTILs, sharing most of their remarkable qualities (e.g., tolerance to humidity, negligible vapor pressure, thermostability, wide electrochemical potential windows, tunability) while overcoming several limitations associated with their RTIL cousins. Particularly, DESs are typically, less expensive, more synthetically accessible (typically, from bulk commodity chemicals using solvent/waste-free processes), nontoxic, and biodegradable.In this Account, we provide an overview of DESs as designer solvents to create well-defined nanomaterials including shape-controlled nanoparticles, electrodeposited films, metal-organic frameworks, colloidal assemblies, hierarchically porous carbons, and DNA/RNA architectures. These breakthroughs illustrate how DESs can fulfill multiple roles in directing chemistry at the nanoscale: acting as supramolecular template, metal/carbon source, sacrificial agent (e.g., ammonia release from urea), and/or redox agent, all in the absence of formal stabilizing ligand (here, solvent and stabilizer are one and the same).The ability to tailor the physicochemical properties of DESs is central to controlling their interfacial behavior. The preorganized "supramolecular" nature of DESs provides a soft template to guide the formation of bimodal porous carbon networks or the evolution of electrodeposits. A number of essential parameters (viscosity, polarity, surface tension, hydrogen bonding), plus coordination with solutes/surfaces, all play significant roles in modulating species reactivity and mass transport properties governing the genesis of nanostructure. Furthermore, DES components may modulate nucleation and growth mechanisms by charge neutralization, modification of reduction potentials (or chemical activities), and passivation of particular crystal faces, dictating growth along preferred crystallographic directions. Broad operational windows for electrochemical reactions coupled with their inherent ionic nature facilitate the electrodeposition of alloys and semiconductors inaccessible to classical means and the use of cosolvents or applied potential control provide under-explored strategies for mediating interfacial interactions leading to control over film characteristics.The biocompatibility of DESs suggests intriguing potential for the construction of biomolecular architectures in these novel media. It has been demonstrated that nucleic acid structures can be manipulated in the ionic, crowded, dehydrating (low water activity) DES environment-including the adoption of duplex helical structures divergent from the canonical B form and parallel G-quadruplex DNA persisting near waters boiling point-challenging the misconception that water is a necessity for maintenance of nucleic acid structure/functionality and suggesting an enticing trajectory toward DNA/RNA-based nanocatalysis within a strictly anhydrous medium.DESs offer tremendous opportunities and open intriguing perspectives for generating sophisticated nanostructures within an anhydrous or low-water medium. We conclude this Account by offering our thoughts on the evolution of the field, pointing to areas of clear and compelling utility which will surely see fruition in the coming years. Finally, we highlight a few hurdles (e.g., need for a universal nomenclature, absence of water-immiscible, oriented-phase, and low-viscosity DESs) which, once navigated, will hasten progress in this area. {\textcopyright} 2014 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {Based on its clinical benefits, Trikafta - the combination of folding correctors VX-661 (tezacaftor), VX-445 (elexacaftor), and the gating potentiator VX-770 (ivacaftor) - was FDA approved for treatment of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) carrying deletion of phenylalanine at position 508 (F508del) of the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) on at least 1 allele. Neither the mechanism of action of VX-445 nor the susceptibility of rare CF folding mutants to Trikafta are known. Here, we show that, in human bronchial epithelial cells, VX-445 synergistically restores F508del-CFTR processing in combination with type I or II correctors that target the nucleotide binding domain 1 (NBD1) membrane spanning domains (MSDs) interface and NBD2, respectively, consistent with a type III corrector mechanism. This inference was supported by the VX-445 binding to and unfolding suppression of the isolated F508del-NBD1 of CFTR. The VX-661 plus VX-445 treatment restored F508del-CFTR chloride channel function in the presence of VX-770 to approximately 62{\%} of WT CFTR in homozygous nasal epithelia. Substantial rescue of rare misprocessing mutations (S13F, R31C, G85E, E92K, V520F, M1101K, and N1303K), confined to MSD1, MSD2, NBD1, and NBD2 of CFTR, was also observed in airway epithelia, suggesting an allosteric correction mechanism and the possible application of Trikafta for patients with rare misfolding mutants of CFTR.},

abstract = {Lipid membranes are indispensable to life, and they regulate countless cellular processes. To investigate the properties of membranes under controlled conditions, numerous reconstitution methods have been developed over the last few decades. Several of these methods result in the formation of lipid bilayers containing residual hydrophobic molecules between the two monolayers. These contaminants might alter membrane properties, including bilayer thickness, that is usually inferred from measurements of membrane capacitance assuming a simple slab model. However, recent measurements on solvent-free bilayers raised significant questions on the reliability of this approach. To reconcile the observed discrepancies, we developed a protocol to predict membrane capacitance from the dielectric profile of lipid bilayers computed from molecular dynamics simulations. Our methodology shows excellent agreement against available data on solvent-free noncharged bilayers, and it confirms that the uniform slab model is a reliable approximation from which to infer membrane capacitance. We find that the effective electrical thickness contributing to membrane capacitance is different from the hydrophobic thickness inferred from X-ray scattering form factors. We apply our model to estimate the concentration of residual solvent in reconstituted systems, and we propose that our protocol could be used to infer membrane properties in the presence of hydrophobic solvents.},

abstract = {The NEDD8-activating enzyme (NAE) initiates neddylation, the cascade of post-translational NEDD8 conjugation onto target proteins. MLN4924, a selective NAE inhibitor, has displayed preclinical anti-tumor activity in vitro and in vivo, and promising clinical activity has been reported in patients with refractory hematologic malignancies. Here, we sought to understand the mechanisms of resistance to MLN4924. K562 and U937 leukemia cells were exposed over a 6 month period to MLN4924 and populations of resistant cells (R-K562 MLN, R-U937MLN) were selected. R-K562MLN and R-U937MLN cells contain I310N and Y352H mutations in the NAE catalytic subunit UBA3, respectively. Biochemical analyses indicate that these mutations increase the enzyme's affinity for ATP while decreasing its affinity for NEDD8. These mutations effectively contribute to decreased MLN4924 potency in vitro while providing for sufficient NAE function for leukemia cell survival. Finally, R-K562MLN cells showed cross-resistance to other NAE-selective inhibitors, but remained sensitive to a pan-E1 (activating enzyme) inhibitor. Thus, our work provides insight into mechanisms of MLN4924 resistance to facilitate the development of more effective second-generation NAE inhibitors. {\textcopyright} 2014 Xu et al.},

Here we discover that bacterial effectors including VirA from nonvacuole Shigella flexneri and EspG from extracellular Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) harbor TBC-like dual-finger motifs and exhibits potent RabGAP activities. Specific inactivation of Rab1 by VirA/EspG disrupts ER-to-Golgi trafficking. S. flexneri intracellular persistence requires VirA TBC-like GAP activity that mediates bacterial escape from autophagy-mediated host defense. Rab1 inactivation by EspG severely blocks host secretory pathway, resulting in inhibited interleukin-8 secretion from infected cells. Crystal structures of VirA/EspG-Rab1-GDP-aluminum fluoride complexes highlight TBC-like catalytic role for the arginine and glutamine finger residues and reveal a 3D architecture distinct from that of the TBC domain. Structure of Arf6-EspG-Rab1 ternary complex illustrates a pathogenic signaling complex that rewires host Arf signaling to Rab1 inactivation. Structural distinctions of VirA/EspG further predict a possible extensive presence of TBC-like RabGAP effectors in counteracting various host defenses. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {AutoDock Tools allows the analysis of docking files and is used to represent clustering conformations, yet it analyses only one docking file at a time and the method applied to represent the clustering complicates the visualization of clustering conformations. The creation of a plugin called PyDRA for the molecular visualizer PyMOL resolves that problem and allows to simultaneously process more than one docking file for the two types of file format from AutoDock 4.2 and Vina 1.1 (dlg and pdbqt). Moreover, this plugin facilitates the visualization of conformations through two clustering methods. The first method is a K-RMSD algorithm, which is based on the clustering through RMSD and enables the interactive visualization groups through a treemap. And the other one is based on a hierarchical clustering algorithm, using an algorithm of average distances which generates a dendrogram that offers the possibility to explore sequentially the groups that illustrate best the docking. The results obtained with the visualization methods implemented showed that the treemap, due to the implemented colour bar, facilitates to identify the clusters that have a greater affinity to the protein at a glance, and to determine which of the clusters hold a greater number of elements, on the other hand, the dendrogram shows a detailed analyses of the hierarchical clustering, which also enables the user to distinguish the clustering regardless the size of the window, as well as to differentiate each cluster and conformation in order to gain insight of docking results of Autdock and Vina. The fact that both visualizations are connected to PyMOL increases its ability of discernment.},

abstract = {Some studies of CFTR imply that channel activation can be explained by an increase in open probability (Po), whereas others suggest that activation involves an increase in the number of CFTR channels (N) in the plasma membrane. Using two-electrode voltage clamp, we tested for changes in N associated with activation of CFTR in Xenopus oocytes using a cysteine-substituted construct (R334C CFTR) that can be modified by externally applied, impairment thiol reagents like [2-(trimethylammonium)ethyl] methanethiosulfonate bromide (MTSET+). Covalent modification of R334C CFTR with MTSET+ doubled the conductance and changed the I-V relation from inward rectifying to linear and was completely reversed by 2-mercaptoethanol (2-ME). Thus, labeled and unlabeled channels could be differentiated by noting the percent decrease in conductance brought about by exposure to 2-ME. When oocytes were briefly (20 s) exposed to MTSET+ before CFTR activation, the subsequently activated conductance was characteristic of labeled R334C CFTR, indicating that the entire pool of CFTR channels activated by cAMP was accessible to MTSET+. The addition of unlabeled, newly synthesized channels to the plasma membrane could be monitored on-line during the time when the rate of addition was most rapid after cRNA injection. The addition of new channels could be detected as early as 5 h after cRNA injection, occurred with a half time of ∼24-48 h, and was disrupted by exposing oocytes to Brefeldin A, whereas activation of R334C CFTR by cAMP occurred with a half time of tens of minutes, and did not appear to involve the addition of new channels to the plasma membrane. These findings demonstrate that in Xenopus oocytes, the major mechanism of CFTR activation by cAMP is by means of an increase in the open probability of CFTR channels.},

Part I of this review begins with the benefits and Poisson statistics of partitioning, including sources of error. The remainder focuses on digital PCR (dPCR) for quantification of nucleic acids. We discuss five commercial instruments that partition samples into physically isolated chambers (cdPCR) or droplet emulsions (ddPCR). We compare the strengths of dPCR (absolute quantitation, precision, and ability to detect rare or mutant targets) with those of its predecessor, quantitative real-time PCR (dynamic range, larger sample volumes, and throughput). Lastly, we describe several promising applications of dPCR, including copy number variation, quantitation of circulating tumor DNA and viral load, RNA/miRNA quantitation with reverse transcription dPCR, and library preparation for next-generation sequencing. This review is intended to give a broad perspective to scientists interested in adopting digital assays into their workflows. Part II focuses on digital protein and cell assays.},

This variant applies conventional molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, which are based on nonpolarizable molecular mechanics (MM) force fields, to the rapid generation of a large ensemble of different solvation shells for a solute molecule. Short hybrid simulations, in which the solute is treated by DFT and the aqueous solvent by MM, start from snapshots of the MM solute-solvent MD trajectory and yield a set of statistically independent hydration shells partially adjusted to the DFT/MM force field. Within INMA, these shells are kept fixed at their 300 K structures, line spectra are calculated from the DFT/MM Hessians of the solute, and its inhomogeneously broadened solution spectra are derived by second-order statistics. As our test application we have selected the phosphate ions HPO42- and H2PO4 because sizable solvation effects are expected for the IR spectra of these strongly polarizable ions. The widths, intensities, and spectral positions of the calculated bands are compared with experimental IR spectra recorded by us for the purpose of checking the computational procedures. These comparisons provide insights into the merits and limitations of the available DFT/MM approach to the prediction of IR spectra in the condensed phase.},

@article{Takekiyo2018,
abstract = {Amyloid aggregates are composed of protein fibrils with a dominant $\beta$-sheet structure, are water-insoluble, and are involved in the pathogenesis of many neurodegenerative diseases. Development of pharmaceuticals to treat these diseases and the design of recovery agents for amyloid-type inclusion bodies require the successful suppression and dissolution of such aggregates. Since ionic liquids (ILs) are composed of both a cation and anion and are known to suppress protein aggregation and to dissolve water-insoluble compounds such as cellulose; they may also have potential use as suppression/dissolution agents for amyloid aggregates. In the following review, we present the suppression and dissolution effects of ILs on amyloid aggregates so far reported. The protein–IL affinity (the ability of ILs to interact with amyloid proteins) was found to be the biochemical basis for ILs' suppression of amyloid formation, and the hydrogen-bonding basicity of ILs might be the basis for their ability to dissolve amyloid aggregates. These findings present the potential of ILs to serve as novel pharmaceuticals to treat neurodegenerative diseases and as recovery agents for various amyloid aggregates.},

@article{Mahdavi2015,
abstract = {Recent determination of the crystal structures of bacterial voltage-gated sodium (NaV) channels have raised hopes that modeling of the mammalian counterparts could soon be achieved. However, there are substantial differences between the pore domains of the bacterial and mammalian NaV channels, which necessitates careful validation of mammalian homology models constructed from the bacterial NaV structures. Such a validated homology model for the NaV1.4 channel was constructed recently using the extensive mutagenesis data available for binding of $\mu$-conotoxins. Here we use this NaV1.4 model to study the ion permeation mechanism in mammalian NaV channels. Linking of the DEKA residues in the selectivity filter with residues in the neighboring domains is found to be important for keeping the permeation pathway open. Molecular dynamics simulations and potential of mean force calculations reveal that there is a binding site for a Na+ ion just inside the DEKA locus, and 1-2 Na+ ions can occupy the vestibule near the EEDD ring. These sites are separated by a low free energy barrier, suggesting that inward conduction occurs when a Na+ ion in the vestibule goes over the free energy barrier and pushes the Na+ ion in the filter to the intracellular cavity, consistent with the classical knock-on mechanism. The NaV1.4 model also provides a good description of the observed Na+/K+ selectivity.},
