 Daniel Golestan, a wise man, once told me that to be given the opportunity to create this thesis was a gift. It was. It was a gift given to me by every friend, colleague, teacher, mentor and family member I've spent any time with. This list of thanks is by nature incomplete. If it was you'd be reading about a conversation I had with a middle aged public servant in a hostel north of San Francisco, but that has little to do with Cystic Fibrosis. 

To my parents who raised me with not only academic rigor in mind but also a respect for the arts which has served me strangely well. I've never had a talent for the creative side of things compared to quantitative disciplines. But were it not for their demand for respect for the arts I'd have remained illiterate. 

To Jeffry for his tutelage and patience, even from across the pacific ocean. 

To Poker. I am a better human being in every conceivable way for having known you. Your wisdom, intelligence and kindness are boundless. You have taught me an inordinate number of things. And yes, I do mean inordinate. 

To Nono and Nona, I don't think you'll ever read this. I'm sad that you won't understand what I've done but I think you'd be proud if you did. Living in Condell park did more for me than you could know. Far from war torn Beirut or dirt poor Orria I'm sitting in a well lit office writing this with a full stomach and few worries. Sometimes this luck makes my head spin. 

To Katelin Allen, Sharon Wong, Laura Fawcett, Renate Griffith and the whole Waters lab. For teaching me so much chemistry and cell biology and helping me write manuscripts. Bridging the gap between cell biology and molecular physics is something that will happen more in the future and I'm lucky to have met such a dedicated lab to teach me to do so.

To the patients and their families who contributed samples to the Waters lab. I hope there is some day a cure for CF and that our work is a small step toward that goal.

To Dr. Shafagh Waters herself. For your vision, your drive and all your advice. You brought me a truly fascinating PhD project and I benefited greatly from your mentorship. Your support really helped me figure out \textit{how} to do this kind of research and any success I have from now on is strongly attributable to the professional skills you helped me develop.

To Serdar, a brilliant mind and a patient boss. Thank you for giving me the best possible experience at grad school I could have asked for. Your willingness to let me pursue self directed projects with a guided hand is a privilege during a PhD and I'm all the better for having gotten it from one of the best. I'm excited to carry some of your physical insight into biological systems to future research projects. 

Of course I must also thank many friends for inspiration and motivation. Alon, Ollie, Chris, Zac, Josh, Deb, Harry and Frank.

Maddy, I miss you every day. You couldn't have imagined what it was like to do this after losing you. I carry much of you with me and I wish I had more. I miss your intelligence, your warmth and your love.

You're all in my Loop and I hope I'm in yours.
