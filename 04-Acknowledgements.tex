 Daniel Golestan, a wise man, once told me that to be given the opportunity to create this thesis was a gift. It was. It was a gift given to me by every friend, colleague, teacher, mentor and family member I've spent any time with. The list that follows of those to thank is not complete. If it was you'd be reading about a conversation I had with a middle aged woman in a hostel north of San Francisco, but that has little to do with Cystic Fibrosis. 

To My parents raised me with not only academic rigor in mind but also a respect for aesthetics which has served me strangely well. I've never had a talent for the creative side of things compared to quantitative disciplines. But were it not for their demand for respect for the arts I'd have remained illiterate. 

To Jeffry for his tutelage and patience, even across the pacific ocean. To have been your first mentee is an honor. You will go far. 

To Poker, I am a better human being in every conceivable way for having known you. Your wisdom, intelligence and kindness are boundless. You have taught me an inordinate number of things. And yes, I do mean inordinate. 

Nono and Nona I don't think you'll ever read this. I'm sad that you won't understand what I've done but I think you'd be proud if you did. Living in Condell park did more for me than you could know. Far from war torn Beirut or dirt poor Orria I'm sitting in a well lit office writing this with a full stomach and few worries. Sometimes this luck makes my head spin. 

Thank you to Shafagh Waters for her vision, her drive and all her advice. You brought me a truly fascinating PhD project and I benefited greatly from your mentorship. Bridging the gap between cell biology and molecular physics is something that will happen more in the future and I'm lucky to have met such a driven lab to teach me to do so. 

Serdar, a brilliant mind and a patient boss. Thank you for giving me the best possible experience at grad school I could have asked for. Your willingness to let me pursue self directed projects with a guided hand is a privilege during a PhD and I'm all the better for having gotten it from one of the best. I'm excited to carry some of your physical insight into biological systems to future research projects. 

Maddy, I miss you every day. You couldn't have imagined what it was like to do this after losing you. I carry much of you with me and I wish I had more. I miss your intelligence, your warmth and your love.

You're all in my Loop and I hope I'm in yours.
