Before beginning, I'd like to acknowledge the traditional owners of the land where this research was conducted, to pay my respects to the elders of these lands, both past and present. 

This research was produced while I lived and worked on the lands of the Gadigal people of the Eora Nation. The computer with which I performed simulations is named ``Gadi", which means ``to search for" in the language of Ngunnawal people on whose land this scientific equipment is located. This name is intended to pay homage to the continued traditions of learning and knowledge sharing which have been practiced by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples for millennia. \newline

Daniel Golestan, a wise man, once told me that to be given the opportunity to create this thesis was a gift. It was. It was a gift given to me by every friend, colleague, teacher, mentor and family member I've spent any time with. This list of thanks is by nature incomplete. If it was you'd be reading about a conversation I had with a middle aged public service woman in a hostel north of San Francisco, but that has little to do with Cystic Fibrosis. Since they would be rightfully offended if I forgot them, I will start with my supervisors.

To Shafagh Waters. For your vision, your drive and all your advice. You brought me a truly fascinating PhD project and I benefited greatly from your mentorship. Full of helpful suggestions and ambition, you really helped me figure out \textit{how} to do this kind of research and your approach to science has made me more confident and more capable.

To Serdar, a brilliant mind and a patient boss. Thank you for giving me the best possible experience at grad school I could have asked for during the pandemic. Your willingness to let me pursue self directed projects with a guided hand is a privilege during a PhD and I'm all the better for having gotten it from one of the best. I'm excited to carry some of your deep physical insight into biological systems to future research projects. 

To Poker Chen. I am a better human being in every conceivable way for having known you. Your wisdom, intelligence and kindness are boundless. You have taught me an inordinate number of things. And yes, I do mean inordinate.

To Jeffry Setiadi. You got me started with these weird and wacky simulations. Thank you for your tutelage and patience, even from across the pacific ocean.

To Renate Griffith for her input, even from Tasmania, as well as Katelin Allen, Sharon Wong, Laura Fawcett, and the rest of the Waters lab. For teaching me so much chemistry and cell biology, and  helping me write manuscripts. Bridging the gap between cell biology and molecular physics is something that will happen more in the future and I'm lucky to have met such a dedicated lab to teach me to do so.

To the patients and their families who participated in the studies designed by the Waters lab and also the support of the Cystic Australia Research Trust and the Peter Domachuck Memorial Scholarship. I hope there is some day a cure for CF and that our work is a small step toward that goal.

To my parents. You raised me with not only academic rigor in mind but also a respect for the arts which has served me strangely well. The hours I spent rendering the images in this thesis I was thinking of you.

To Nonno and Nonna, I don't think you'll read this. I'm sad that you won't understand what I've done but I think you'd be proud if you did. Living in Condell park did more for me than you could know. Far from war torn Beirut or dirt poor Orria, I'm sitting in a well lit office writing this with a full stomach and few worries. Sometimes this luck makes my head spin. 

Of course I must also thank many friends for inspiration and motivation. Alon, Ollie, Harrison, Chris, Zac, Josh, Markus, Joseph, Deb, Harry, Ashwin, Calida, Tilly, Helena, Hway, Nicko, David, Alex, Amy, Gareth, Shirley, Nick, Natasha, Aleksa, Frank and my dear sister Carla.

Finally. Maddy, I love you. I miss you every day. You couldn't have imagined what it was like to finish this after losing you. I carry so much of you with me and I wish I had more. I miss your intelligence, your warmth and your love.

To all of you, thank you for your help along the way. You're all in my Loop \cite{hofstadter2007} and I hope I'm in some of yours.
