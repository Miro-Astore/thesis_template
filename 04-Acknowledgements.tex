 Daniel Golestan, a wise man, once told me that to be given the opportunity to create this thesis was a gift. It was. It was a gift given to me by every friend, colleague, teacher, mentor and family member I've spent any time with. This list of thanks is by nature incomplete. If it was you'd be reading about a conversation I had with a middle aged public service woman in a hostel north of San Francisco, but that has little to do with Cystic Fibrosis. 

To Jeffry Setiadi. You got me started with these weird and wacky simulations. Thank you for your tutelage and patience, even from across the pacific ocean.

To Poker Chen. I am a better human being in every conceivable way for having known you. Your wisdom, intelligence and kindness are boundless. You have taught me an inordinate number of things. And yes, I do mean inordinate.

To Shafagh Waters. For your vision, your drive and all your advice. You brought me a truly fascinating PhD project and I benefited greatly from your mentorship. Full of helpful suggestions and ambition, you really helped me figure out \textit{how} to do this kind of research and your approach to science has made me more confident and more capable.

To Serdar, a brilliant mind and a patient boss. Thank you for giving me the best possible experience at grad school I could have asked for. Your willingness to let me pursue self directed projects with a guided hand is a privilege during a PhD and I'm all the better for having gotten it from one of the best. I'm excited to carry some of your deep physical insight into biological systems to future research projects. 

To Renate Griffith for her help, even from Tasmania, as well as Katelin Allen, Sharon Wong, Laura Fawcett, and the rest of the Waters lab. For teaching me so much cell biology and helping me write manuscripts. Bridging the gap between cell biology and molecular physics is something that will happen more in the future and I'm lucky to have met such a dedicated lab to teach me to do so.

To the patients and their families who participated in the studies designed by the Waters lab. I hope there is some day a cure for CF and that our work is a small step toward that goal.

To my parents. You raised me with not only academic rigor in mind but also a respect for the arts which has served me strangely well. I've never had a talent for the creative side of things compared to quantitative disciplines, but were it not for the exposure to the arts you gave me I'd have remained illiterate. 

To Nonno and Nonna, I don't think you'll read this. I'm sad that you won't understand what I've done but I think you'd be proud if you did. Living in Condell park did more for me than you could know. Far from war torn Beirut or dirt poor Orria, I'm sitting in a well lit office writing this with a full stomach and few worries. Sometimes this luck makes my head spin. 

Of course I must also thank many friends for inspiration and motivation. Alon, Ollie, Harrison, Chris, Zac, Josh, Markus, Joseph, Deb, Harry, Ashwin, Calida, Hway, Nicko, David, Alex, Amy, Nick, Natasha, Aleksa, Frank and my sister Carla.

Finally, Maddy, I love you. I miss you every day. You couldn't have imagined what it was like to do this after losing you. I carry much of you with me and I wish I had more. I miss your intelligence, your warmth and your love.

To all of you, thank you for your help along the way. You're all in my Loop \cite{hofstadter2007} and I hope I'm in some of yours.
