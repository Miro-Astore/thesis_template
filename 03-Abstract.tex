Cystic Fibrosis is the most common fatal genetic condition in Caucasian populations. It is a debiletating disease, significnatly shortening the life span of patients and degrading their quality of life. It is caused by deleterious mutations to a protein known as the Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane conductance Regulator (CFTR). This protein acts as an anion channel.

Over the last decade there have been an increasing number of clinically approved small molecule drugs which act directly on CFTR in order to restore its function. These drugs are called CFTR modulators. Unfortunatley, since CF is a rare disease and there are more than 400 mutations which cause it, it is currently unclear which mutations will respond to modulator therapy. This leaves many patients with under studied mutations unable to access modulator therapy.

In this work we performed extensive molecular dynamics (MD) and free energy calculations in order to characterise the many different ways that the CFTR can misfunction. This was done with in close collaboration with \textit{in vitro} and clinical experiments in order to understand what types of molecular defects may be treated by existing medications. This work will help more pateints access modulator therapy.
