\appendix

An appendix of uncollected thoughts. 

\begin{itemize}
\item Considering that the passive immune system consists of more inanimate layers of the body such as the skin would it not also make sees that social elements of our behaviour form part of our immune system as well? Think about the visceral reaction we have toward fecal matter or someone vomiting. These are neural queues to change our behaviour. Could our pandemic response, social distancing and vaccine development then be viewed as part of our adaptive immunity. 

\item V(D)J recombination is a process where the body somatically shuffles parts other genome in order to create variable antibodies which target pathogenic substrates with high affinity and specificity. It's amazing and potentially has important implications for protein physics and protein bioinformatics.

\item There are considerable efforts to develop drug discovery mechanisms for specific cell types \cite{yu2020} as this has the potential to reduce the off target side effects and increase therapeutic efficacy. 

\item The megaplate experiment\cite{baym2016} is an illustrative example of a Strange Loop \cite{hofstadter2007}. 

\end{itemize}
