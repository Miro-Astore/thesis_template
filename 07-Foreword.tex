The more I wrote this thesis the more I found myself writing for my past self. When I first started simulating them I didn't even know what a protein was. So, I think the audience for this thesis would be somebody who has a loose grasp of third year undergraduate physics. What this audience will be less familiar is the breadth of pre requisites to understand the contents. What I have not had time to do is write an introduction to molecular biology. So I recommend a physics based introduction to those concepts such as those found in \cite{phillips2012}. On this note of pedagogy, some care has been  taken to name certain authors to give the reader a kind of anchor for where to look in the literature. Similarly, when a biological or chemical concept a physicist might not be familiar with is mentioned, I have searched for a useful review article or explainer. So please take citations as reading recommendations \cite{dawkins1989, hofstadter1999}.

The past few years I have been captivated by the unending complexity in biological systems. If you need some inspiration please take this opportunity treat yourself to the fabulous work of \href {https://pdb101.rcsb.org/sci-art/goodsell-gallery}{David Goodsell} \cite{goodsell2009, goodsell2018, goodsell2020}. I've found that the mindset for solving biological problems feels very different to the focus we cultivate in students when they study idealised problems in mathematics and physics. The problems are more specific and the required knowledge is broader. For example, plasma physicists may use the same mathematical tools to describe materials as diverse as the dense stellar core to the sparse intergalactic nebulae. These objects span 28 orders of magnitude in density \cite{chen2018}. Would that we were so lucky in biology, where we struggle to apply same physical models to deal with phenomena across a single order of magnitude. This diversity means we need many hands to solve problems in biology. Note that all the publications arising from this thesis have many many authors. Each researcher specialises not unlike, cells in a complex organism, in a specific discipline, but we all work together to produce the research.

If the reader is anything like myself they will find the amount assumed knowledge in biology daunting. It is quite difficult at first to figure out what questions to even ask or even figure out which subfield is causing us confusion. These difficulties are best alleviated by cultivating a broad coalition of connections, speak to medical doctors, clinicians, molecular biologists, biochemists \footnote{These last two are in fact different subfields but like many in this list it'll take you some time to understand the subtle differences which define each one.}, cell biologists, geneticists, bioinformaticians, theoretical chemists, computer scientists, neuroscientists, physicists, mathematicians, everyone. It will take time but remain patient and you will eventually find that a physics motivated approach can indeed explain and often even predict outcomes in biological experiments. A broad world view awaits you and it's really quite fun. 

The physics focussed philosophy in the introductory chapter \ref{chap:intro} and the literature in chapter \ref{chap:methods} will hopefully serve as a road map for my future students. A physicist studying biology will be best served by nurturing a strong basis in electrodynamics and statistical mechanics \cite{griffiths2017, reif2009, zuckerman2010}. The issue is that the field is now progressing so quickly that I'm sure much of this thesis will be out of date by the time it's read by anybody I'd hope to train. But them's the breaks \cite{reuters2022}. Shoot me an email if you want help though \href{mailto:miro.astore@gmailcom}{miro.astore@gmail.com}.

The heterogeneity of biology is easy to observe. If you look at your arm, you will notice hair, pores, dry skin, dead skin, perhaps even tendons and muscles twitching beneath the surface. If you were to take a single cell from just beneath the skin and stain it to distinguish features in an electron microscope, you would find all sorts of complex structures called organelles. The size, shape and function of these elements would be different if the cell was taken from somewhere else in your body. Within and between each those organelles is a salty, wet dance of molecules large and small. This journey from your arm to your organelles spans 5 orders of magnitude. The complexity across length scales hints at the reasons behind biology's physical complexity.

A physicist can talk about both ends of this scale, we should learn something about the middle too.}

There are 23392 different types of proteins in the human body, and this thesis represents an all consuming effort by a single PhD student, expending decades of computation to make incremental in studying a single one. There is so much to do. In any case, good luck and bring a towel \cite{adams1979}.
